At a time when most movies were content to slap a rubber costume on somebody and have him demolish a miniature model of a city, Forbidden Planet forever raised the bar and showed that it was possible to make a science fiction movie which actually had a plot.<br /><br />I doubt that many SF movies made in the \\'90s will still be considered worth watching in 2030.',\n"," 'The story of \"Simon says\" is nothing new. Some teenagers in the wood get hunted down by some sicko. So, I didn\\'t expect much anyway in that regard. Still, the movie disappointed me. The teenagers are just your basic clichés for this kind of movie, which is not necessarily bad, but the main problem is the main character, Simon. In my opinion he\\'s just way overdone. The acting is almost like a caricature. So, what should be a threatening character ends up being a (sadly bad) joke. The kills are good, but that\\'s about it. Everything else in this movie just is below par, even for the genre. <br /><br />Still, with a better Simon this movie could be fun. With that guy it\\'s more a pain to watch than anything else. Avoid this movie.',\n"," 'Mr. Kennedy should stop ExPeRiMeNtIng with bad movie scripts. What WAS he thinking?

It seems these days that if there is a buck to be made, movie execs will dig up an old hit and run it by a set of writers and see what turns up. (Hey, I said \"hit and run\"! Kinda describes how I felt when this movie ended!) How THIS piece of trash ever saw the light of day is beyond me. It is filled with unpleasant humor, strange animation and jokes that don\\'t quite take you anywhere besides a state of confusion. If you are being dragged to this movie, and someone is paying for you....fine.... but its still going to be more painful than a brick in the forehead. However, if you\\'re planning on paying your own hard-earned money, search out a better alternative.',\n"," 'James Cagney pulled off one of his greatest gangster roles fairly late in his career in 1949\\'s White Heat. You could see he was starting to get a little pudgy in the midsection and gray around the temples for that kind of role, but he still pulled it off.....big-time. What a lot of people don\\'t remember is that he did it one more time - with this film, the following year.<br /><br />Yup, \"Cody Jarrett\" was in business for one more tough-guy gangster character. Here, he plays \"Ralph Cotter,\" and he is one nasty dude. It\\'s great to watch Jimmy doing his cocky-thug routine. I wish he could have gone on forever.<br /><br />The supporting cast, led by Ward Bond, was very good in this film and worth noting. It isn\\'t just all Cagney. Barbara Peyton is realistic as the tough blonde and Helena Carter as the spoiled rich man\\'s daughter. Both are decent at heart and vie for Cagney\\'s affections.<br /><br />Included in here are crooked cops, a crooked lawyer and other assorted characters. It\\'s a rough movie. Nobody is trustworthy in this story, which is interesting all the way. It should be better known.',\n"," 'To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it.<br /><br />This was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up. Their inventive and comedic series (sort of an American Idol of their day) took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured supergroup around them.<br /><br />This is their take on their \"manufactured image\" and status as the 2nd tier Beatles. They always felt they were in a box, trapped, and unable to find credibility despite their talents.<br /><br />It is also a hell of a musical-trippy, inventive (I have the soundtrack) and full of surprises.<br /><br />See it with an open mind.',\n"," 'Lots of people say that this show is getting really old. I have to disagree. I just love the concept of the show. Vote people out until there\\'s only one person standing. I love it! I want to go on it, but I don\\'t think it\\'ll be around anymore by the time I turn 21. Still, it\\'s a great show. Great competition, likable people (most of the time), and a 1 million dollar prize. This last season (Fiji) was really boring, but I know the show can still stay fresh. It\\'s always really fun to watch, and I always get upset if I miss an episode.<br /><br />Two of the best things that ever happened to the show were Stephenie LaGrossa and Rupert Boneham. Steph, was easily one of the most competitive people ever on the show, she was likable, and everyone was rooting for her to win in her first season. She also played a great game in her second season. She deserved a million dollars, even though she didn\\'t win. Rupert, easily the most popular contestant the show has ever had, also played a great game both time, and everyone loved him.<br /><br />Seasons from best to worst (I haven\\'t seen seasons 3-6)<br /><br />Guatemala- It was really great after the merge, had great players, and Steph and Danni were the best Final 2 ever (I wish they still did the Final 2).<br /><br />Vanuatu- I don\\'t know why everyone hated this one. It was really good. The whole Chris, Twila, Eliza, and Scout thing was really good. Once Chad got voted out it got a lot better. Although the whole \"Twila swore on her son\" crap was too much. I couldn\\'t stand how they wouldn\\'t stop talking about that. But I thought that it was really good once they switched up the tribes.<br /><br />Exile Island- This would probably be ranked higher if Terry (barf) didn\\'t do so well. I hate it when people say that if you win all the challenges then you should win. Survivor is not a physical game. I really liked Aras, Danielle (Red Sox fan!), Cirie, and Sally. Courtney and Shane were annoying, but entertaining. <br /><br />Pearl Islands- Unpredictables with a capital U. I hated Jonny Fairplay, and Rupert was a little irritating (he was better in All-Stars), but Sandra was great, and Jonny Fairplay still put a great spin on the game.<br /><br />All-Stars- I thought that the return of all the characters was really good and I hope they do that again. Although there were 2 pointless episodes when Jenna and Sue quit. Rob C should\\'ve been around longer. And the whole Boston Rob/Amber thing was really annoying. Raise your hand if you\\'re NOT sick of them.<br /><br />Cook Islands- from the time where Cao Boi and Cristina got out to where Jonathan got out was great! everything else was just boring. Come on, Ozzy winning everything! lame! Yul was the more deserving one cuz he played a better game. I wish Parvati stayed around longer.<br /><br />Palau- Steph was awesome and she deserved better. Tom was annoying and so was Ian, and Caryn, and Gregg, and Jenn, and everyone else who wasn\\'t Steph, so but since Tom won everything, it was boring.<br /><br />Australia- Overrated. I liked Elisabeth, and Alicia looked like a man she was so buff. (not really). Colby was annoying and they had too much crap about \"discovering your inner self.\" But the later seasons were better than the earlier ones.<br /><br />Fiji- This season never really entranced me like the other ones did. And the Dreamz/Yau Man thing was annoying. After the merge was okay, but this season was really boring.<br /><br />Borneo- BORING! BORING! BORING! nothing else to say<br /><br />I LOVE this show, and I could write about it for hours. Every week I can\\'t wait to watch it. I think it only has 2 seasons left, but I still love the show, and enjoy it while it lasts.',\n"," 'This film could have drove it\\'s \"point\" home a lot better than presented. It should have stayed CLEAR away from the feel of the 70\\'s type \"blaxpoitation\" films. But this film was not so bad at all.<br /><br />It tells a story, a story of a big time 70\\'s guy who\\'s soul has not been put to rest. He has a vendetta, dead or not, he needed to see it to its full completion. (Ya know, similar to George W. Bush and his Iraq thing.)<br /><br />Ernest Dickerson is a darn excellent cinematographer and director of photography. In the 80\\'s I enjoyed his work on \"Tales From The Darkside\" and I can see he was headed for it here. Trouble is, in feature film, audiences expect more. Progression is the key, and Ernest went for a 70\\'s blaxpoitation thing here instead of just telling the tale as it should be.<br /><br />Snoop Dog actually did a good job for the material here. If nothing else, this was his audition tape for the feature film: \"Starsky and Hutch\".<br /><br />The stereotypical parts for the other actors is what turned me off. (Turned me off in the 70\\'s as well.) which is why this film could have done without it.<br /><br />But it is an entertaining film.

Harry Carey is Wayne's partner.<br /><br />This is at least the 4th version of this story and it won't be the last. A tale of gold mining, claim jumping, saloon, muddy streets, brawls and fancy women will always be in style.<br /><br />Hang on to your hat and enjoy another Wayne classic.\",\n"," 'This movie has a few minor flaws that keep it from being what i consider a classic. The first time i saw this movie, i missed the opening scene where sean penn meets with his contact before going undercover, so i didnt know noonan was a cop until he confessed it. For me this made the movie much more interesting. I think something is lost by knowing the characters secret from the beginning.<br /><br />I also liked the irish-italian mafia subplot, but did not like the fact that it was the driving force behind all the key events in the film. In my opinion it would have been better left in the background. However, I admit I cant think of a better vehicle for the story. Maybe I would have liked it better if Terry wasnt a cop at all, but then it would have been a whole different movie.<br /><br />State of Grace as it is is a very good movie. I found the nighttime and early morning scenes when terry is first back in the kitchen absolutely intoxicationg. The Rooftop scene with Oldman, and Terry seeing Kathleen for the first time really communicated the feeling of Terry being home after a long time, and truly being HOME.<br /><br />Sean Penn and Robin Wright did a great job of portraying characters torn apart inside by conflicting feelings and loyalties. In contrast Gary Oldmans character is also torn up in side, but he has no conflict, he is happy going right over the edge.<br /><br />Worth seeing for any gangster film fan if for no other reason than because it is one of the few that deals with the Irish Mob. Also worth watching at least once for anyone who has experienced conflicted loyalties or rediscovered a lost love.',\n"," \"The above is just one of MANY great lines offered up by the cast of 'Serial Mom'.....<br /><br />The Sutphins seem to be the picture of a normal 50's-esque family - dad (Sam Waterston) is a dentist; mom (a FANTASTIC Kathleen Turner) is a grand house wife homage to Donna Reed, June Cleaver and such; daughter (Rikki Lake) and son (Matthey Lillard) seem to be your average teens with a perfect family life.... Or is it?<br /><br />Based upon actual real life events, John Waters manages to bring us another great film - and this time - he takes dead aim on the 'celebrity' we make of murderers and criminals....<br /><br />I'm sure that many of us have gone through our lives, being annoyed by this person or that object and we've never done anything about it.... Not Betty Sutphin.... When this suburban mom goes off - she goes off.... From minor annoyances (white shoes after labor day!) to major anger management issues, Betty takes matters into her own hands - by going on a killing spree - taking 6 victims to an early grave....<br /><br />Sure, in typical Waters way, it's a bit over the top and corny, but the film is great! Some of the humor is very low brow - in bad taste, but, as Waters mentions in interviews - bad taste can be good taste!<br /><br />I gave this a 9 - a greatly enjoyable film!\",\n"," \"Caught this on cable quite by accident-- the idea behind it seemed really cute, and I decided to give it 10 minutes, to at least see how long it took for the filmmakers to screw it up.<br /><br />Surprisingly, it held my attention for the entire film. The gimmick never got old; just when it seemed in danger of doing so, something new would happen to keep it fresh. A new character here, a plot twist there. Good, thoughtful filmmaking... and I really dug the 1920's slang. I wish I could remember more of it. Why DID we stop talking like this, anyway?<br /><br />Good acting, some clever writing and a smartly-plotted story. The ending was a little cheesy, I thought, as I wanted to know the fates of the characters beyond the newspaper-story driven plot.

Surely the least of the Hammer Draculas (Marcus Hearn on the Audio Commentary for THE CREEPING FLESH [1973] even goes so far as to call it the studio's nadir!), the film really flounders due to its totally unhip - and now embarrassingly dated - updating of the myth (the modern-day setting actually suited SATANIC RITES rather better)...even if, truth be told, it's still vastly preferable to dreck like Dracula 2000 (2000) or VAN HELSING (2004)!<br /><br />Despite Christopher Lee's vociferous bashing of the film, he still cuts an undeniably striking figure as the undead vampire (even if he appears very little and is inexplicably confined to one setting); likewise, Peter Cushing delivers his usual committed performance. The only other noteworthy acting job in the film is that given by Christopher Neame (son of director Ronald) as Johnny Alucard(!) - even if that's only because of how unbelievably hammy it is! Unfortunately, the two best-known female members of the cast (both of them horror regulars) - Stephanie Beacham and Caroline Munro - can't rise above their physical attributes.<br /><br />The camera-work is by Dick Bush (who had shot THE BLOOD ON SATAN'S CLAW [1971] and, for Hammer, WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH [1970] and TWINS OF EVIL [1971] - but is perhaps best known for his longtime association with Ken Russell) which manages some nice atmosphere throughout, especially during three crucial sequences: the carriage-ride scuffle at the (properly Gothic) beginning; the hysterical Black Mass sequence, followed by the resuscitation of Dracula; and the final confrontation between Lee and Cushing's Van Helsing.\",\n"," \"This is my favourite film, so imagine how disturbed I was when I picked this up on DVD and discovered the awesome soundtrack had been changed!<br /><br />I have no idea why they decided to change the music for the DVD release, but the film was much cooler with the original soundtrack. <br /><br />In fact, some of the scenes don't even work without the original music - the characters movements are totally out of time - check out the Church scene at the end - why are they dancing to bells? Originally it was a cool rock song.<br /><br />The scene at the dodgy S&M club has also been changed. The music doesn't stop when Beth and Steve enter the room. I can't describe what an awful experience it is watching this film without the original music.<br /><br />The film, with the original soundtrack, is absolutely awesome.

At the time this film was made, the PC was just starting to be used for common uses. This film is a pretty accurate look back at the state of the industry for 1992, and some of the speculative uses shown here have actually come into being.<br /><br />This film shows Robert Redford as he heads a group of people who are uniquely talented in manipulating several fields of computer and telephone uses... and Ab-uses.<br /><br />As head of this band of electronic robin hoods, Redford as \\'Marty\\' Bishop is tricked into stealing a piece of technology and handing it over to Bad Guys headed by \"Cosmo\" aka Gandhi/Ben Kingsley - And this piece of Tech can literally shout secrets over rooftops... Hence, \"No More Secrets\". The item in question actually deals with encryption algorithms that are still in use today.<br /><br />In an attempt to re-acquire this little gadget, Redford assembles his team and with the help of girlfriend Mary McDonnell, attempts to infiltrate the Marin County \"fortress of solitude\" of criminal Ben Kingsley.<br /><br />The technical and comedic situations which arise in this caper make a wholly fun and interesting film. These pranks are highly humorous and basically succeed... And some of them were not too far off the mark due to the technical assistance by one of the scientists who actually developed part of the technology which this film refers to.<br /><br />There are several nods and references to the films \"THX-1138\" by Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola\\'s \"The Conversation\", and Barry Levinson\\'s \"The Natural\"... and \"Three Days of the Condor\".',\n"," 'Nothing at the 2004 Savannah Film Festival was quite as frustrating to watch as the non-dimensional, feature-length helping of twisted Southern principles, \"Crazy Like a Fox.\" The plot: A man sells his house to rich snobs and, after being tricked, changes his mind. He manages to conjure up the support of his fellow Southern folk in an effort to drive the outsiders out of their town. U.K. actor Roger Rees plays Nat Banks, a Virginian farmer who even after living his whole life in the South still hasn\\'t been able to stop speaking with a British accent (seriously, he does, and without explanation).<br /><br />The bad guys, played like cartoon characters, manage to purchase Nat\\'s house fairly and squarely. Unable to deal, Nat begins camping out on their property. Eventually, he musters the courage to seize the house with the support of the police, judges and anyone else who doesn\\'t care about breaking the law.<br /><br />Perplexing and ultimately unsettling, \"Crazy Like a Fox\" argues that law, order and a free market are not valued in Virginia and that rich, snobby people are mean and should be kicked out of small towns.

Nearly every character mailed it in and sleepwalked through their characters. The rest played so over-the-top that you want to hold your head in your hands and groan. And, once again, the Highlander writers find another half-assed reason to make another movie (the prize in the last movie? no no no, that wasn't the REAL prize, THIS is the real prize.).<br /><br />If you're a Highlander fan, don't even watch this.

Oppressively set in a shadowy house during a raging storm, this head-scratching talk-fest quickly tires both the eye and the ear. The scenario is full of dreary eccentrics, although Parker Posey's 'Jackie-O' is a dark, original creation unto herself. The actress, known for going out on a limb with basically unplayable roles, manages to walk a fine line between comically scabrous and downright scary (which, in an otherwise boring movie, is a triumph). Other performances by Josh Hamilton, Tori Spelling, Freddie Prinze, Jr., and a sadly under-valued Genevieve Bujold are not quite as on-target, mainly due to the sophomoric writing. *1/2 from ****\",\n"," 'I won\\'t lie, I rented this film because it was an \"arty\" film with some possible explicit sex. I got that scene and Catherine Deneuve\\'s (briefly shown) breasts, but the rest of the film is just the usual long pretentious European art films with lines like \"Did I have a mother or father, I don\\'t know\" (paraphrased).

You\\'d think \"Monster\" would be fun...but it isn\\'t, really. It does star Tony Eisley and John Carradine, however, and in my book that makes it worth viewing at least once. In an interview with \"Fangoria\" in 1987, Eisley recalled that Herbert Strock had directed the bulk of the film, but somehow Kenneth Hartford--who only directed the footage featuring his children Andrea and Glenn (portraying characters named Andrea and Glenn, in a particularly inventive turn)--received full credit. Considering how awful the end result was, Strock was probably glad that he hadn\\'t been credited! \"Monster\" has the look and feel of a mid-to-late-seventies TV movie, which is why I like to leave it on in the background every so often.

It was very funny and life was beautiful! Then out of nowhere Jews are persecuted, people get sent to concentration camps and Mr Benigni becomes annoying. <br /><br />I didn't know who I wanted to slap out first, Him or his cutesy little son who never got dirty inside a supposed harsh and un-human environment of a concentration camp. For that fact, his wife still looked a little too pretty to me with that heavy make-up, which did not resemble any sedimentary cosmetics produced by mother earth.<br /><br />Many historical questions must be raised when dealing with something so historical such as a holocaust. Where was the over-crowding? Why was everyone so clean? Why did everyone look like they ate three square meals a day? Why were the Germans portrayed as if they came from an episode of 'Hogans Hero's'? On and on..<br /><br />If anyone noticed, this film relied on two major sets where at least 80% of action occured.

This movie is boring, obnoxiously mind-numbing, and at times offensive and disgusting. At most, it contains one or two moments that make you laugh. Also, it seems twice as long as its 85 minute running time.\",\n"," \"When I first heard of this movie, I was mildly interested. The plot seemed like an opportunity for hilarity and Bam Margera as an actor and director seemed like something that might be good. When I found out the movie starred Ryan Dunn, I was even further interested (I was a fan of Homewrecker when it was on... Yeah, I'm that lame). However, I didn't have much faith in it being to good. When I sat down to watch it, I was afraid I was wasting my time.<br /><br />But even just five minutes it it became apparent that I'd been wrong.<br /><br />I thought that the comedy of this film was delightfully idiotic, and definitely not suited for all kinds of people. The acting was rather good, much better than my expectations. I thought that it was rather easy to relate to Ryan's character, which gave the movie a center that was believable. This is key in a movie as outrageous as this (and is probably why I was not a fan of Borat).<br /><br />The movie is not suitable at all for younger people, DUH, and will definitely create more than it's fair share of awkward turtles if watched with parents.

It's a snail-paced film featuring Nastassia Kinski as a model recruited by Rudolf Nureyev to kill Harvey Keitel. Kinski is pretty good and looks striking and Nureyev is suitably mysterious. Unfortunately Toback's script suffers from a real case of inertia, the plot doesn't so much unfold as it oozes. Kinski's character is fuzzy and Keitel, who shows up near the end of the film, is really given nothing to do. There is some terrific, very moody photography by Henri Decaë and the film does work as a travelogue of sort of the more seedy parts of Paris. Toback makes an un-billed appearance as Kinski's brusque college professor. Pierre Clémenti plays one of his typically creepy roles as one of Keitel's less trustworthy confidants.\",\n"," 'This adorable dog (called various names during the film) is seemingly loved by the whole town...but he\\'s alone.

And what about Angela? Obviously Holly's performance would knock Angela down a few pegs, but nothing is shown to indicate how she reacts.

But I should have known something was up when I read it was only 75 minutes long. I thought, \"I hate judging movies by how long they are. Who says a movie has to be 90 minutes?\" But once I took the DVD home from BBuster, I was shocked at the awful production quality, acting, directing of this completely amateurish piece of garbage. The only reason I watched it to the end was because I don\\'t have cable TV, and I already paid four bucks for it. However, there was one ray of light: the actor who played \"Chris\" is actually decent, and far outclasses this dreck. First of all, the special effects were cheap and unconvincing. Then the aliens--the costumes seemed interesting (rubber suits) but since most of the film takes place in the dark, you don\\'t really get to see them! And hardly any of the actors were convincing enough to suspend disbelief. Finally, I must say that the DVD jacket was made with much higher production standards than the film itself, which felt like a rip-off, so beware of that when you rent other DVDs.

What I got was something more boring and pointless than I could have possibly imagined. Okay, lets be fair. Not everything is going to be the Road Warrior. However, this movie promises to showcase the \"terrifying...danger\" of the new world, and last time i checked, overlong shots of nothing happening coupled with occasional histrionic shrieking do not a good film make. Nothing of interest happens in the film. The post apocalypse genre is horribly underused, and almost limitless in its potential. To make a movie like this is tantamount to being offered one million dollars to spend on any car of your choice and choosing a 1987 Chevy Nova with no muffler. Speaking of money, its not like they were particularly constrained by budget. There are real actors in the movie, who probably got more than a little compensation for appearing, not to mention countless extras. Besides this, however, there is nothing original or dynamic to be had. The \"society\" that is formed in the train depot is about as generic and lame as anyone could ask. I ask you, what threatens these people? Being bored to death? this pushes the boundaries of avant-garde filmaking over into the realm of crap. The acting is unremarkable and perhaps even irrelevant to the story. The cinematography is appealing, but NOTHING IS DONE WITH IT. There is no sense of imminent danger. I didn\\'t feel for the characters at all. I would recommend this film to snooty intellectuals who think that a ten minute long shot of a french child burying a parakeet is the apex of modern cinema.

This is *clearly* not a movie made to be taken in the slightest bit seriously, referencing with a knowing wink many contemporary classics, including Ando's most Western-mainstream movie Battle Royale, and taking the mickey out of them quite mercilessly.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie greatly, but don't watch it thinking you're going to be getting anything as unique or profound as Uzumaki or Long Dream, otherwise you *will* be disappointed.

There was also a good episode when Nathan Lane was on the show, but that was the only one worth watching--the rest of them were pretty much the same.

Well, I don't think any one has died of fright from seeing this film, but a few may have died of boredom. THE SCREAMING SKULL is the sort of movie that makes Ed Wood look good.<br /><br />Very loosely based on the famous Francis Marion Crawford story, SKULL is about a wealthy but nervous woman who marries a sinister man whose first wife died under mysterious circumstances. Once installed in his home, she is tormented by a half-wit gardener, a badly executed portrait, peacocks, and ultimately a skull that rolls around the room and causes her to scream a lot. And to her credit, actress Peggy Webber screams rather well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, her ability to do so is the high point of the film. The plot is pretty transparent, to say the least, and while the cast is actually okay, the script is dreadful and the movie so uninspired you'll be ready to run screaming yourself. True, the thing only runs about sixty-eight minutes, but it all feels a lot longer. Add to this a truly terrible print quality and there you are.<br /><br />There are films that are so bad they are fun to watch. It is true that THE SCREAMING SKULL has a few howlers--but the film drags so much I couldn't work up more than an occasional giggle, and by the time the whole thing is over your head will roll from ennui.

It was during a local programming period, and the local listing of the title was erroneous, so I was able to get to this site only after seeing the credits at the end.<br /><br />I had flipped-on the record button, and so was able to count the number of stunt performers in this picture -- count\\'em -- sixty-five (65)!! <br /><br />Frankly, I had not heard of Gary Daniels until this flick. Part of the fun of doing these comments (for me it is great relaxation therapy), is sometimes reading the other comments as you are doing yours.<br /><br />I see several from obvious Daniels aficionados, and some with criticism of the acting. \"Sol\" from Brooklyn had an enjoyable comment to read (and I\\'d guess someone named Sol, from Brooklyn, ought to have some degree of affinity and familiarity with this genre), and others noted Daniels\\' less-than-Di Nero- or -Pacino- level of acting talent -- but these do not diminish the superior action elements of the story. Daniels\\' obviously prodigious abilities in the martial arts make his level of activity in dispatching the bad guys very believable (even though the extent, circumstances and numbers of adversaries involved may stretch this believability a tad).<br /><br />I got into the film just as the several policeman, who were involved in the bust where the Don\\'s son was killed, were being debriefed.

I am convinced that South Park is the best show on TV (and the only excuse to turn on that disgusting Comedy Central [AKA The Beer and Sex Channel,]) but some people wonder if the movie is as good as the show. Take my word for it, it isn\\'t. It\\'s ten times better. In the movie, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny see an R-rated film starring their favorite Canadian actors, Terrance and Philip. The movie is entitled Asses of Fire, and if I may quote Arthur Taussig, the title is the least offensive thing about it. In the opening scene of Asses of Fire, we discover why it was rated R. I won\\'t give away one of the funniest parts of the movie, but I\\'ll just say that I didn\\'t know you could use that many obscenities in only three minutes. When the movie ends, the boys leave the theatre repeating all the words they\\'ve heard in the film. Not knowing what the words mean, they continue this behavior the next day at school. Their teacher sends them to the guidance counselor who subsequently calls their mothers. As those who watch the show may have guessed, Sheila Brosfloski, Kyle\\'s mother, is outraged and begins a campaign to have the film banned.<br /><br />It\\'s general pop-culture knowledge that Kenny McCormick is killed in nearly EVERY episode of South Park. One can naturally assume that his death in the movie would be the Kenny-death-to-end-all-Kenny-deaths. It is, but unlike his frequent deaths in the show, his death in the movie is a huge contributing factor to the plot. This may be a slight spoiler (if you can call the way in which Kenny dies a spoiler.) The boys end up seeing the movie again, and Kenny is killed while imitating something he saw in the film that may be too inappropriate say in this review. He is banished to Hell for skipping church to see the film, and we discover that Satan and Saddam Hussein are in a homosexual love affair. In this relationship, Satan is surprisingly warm and caring and wants to communicate with Saddam, but Saddam just wants sex. The conversations between these two characters throughout the film are hilarious. Meanwhile, back on Earth, Sheila Brosfloski\\'s movement to have Terrance and Philip banned has spun out of control. Canada is blamed for all of the problems of America\\'s youth, America is preparing to literally wage war against Canada, all Canadian-American citizens are sent to death-camps, and Terrance and Philip are scheduled to be executed. Back in Hell, Kenny listens to a conversation between Satan and Saddam. Bible readers know the seven signs of the end of the world. The fall of an empire, the coming of a comet, etc. We discover that when the blood of Terrance and Philip touches American soil, Satan and Saddam Hussein will ascend from Hell and rule the earth. It is now up to Stan, Kyle, and Cartman to save humanity from the horrors of every Christian\\'s worst nightmare, and his boyfriend, George W. Bush\\'s worst nightmare. This film is more than hilarious. I am convinced that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are the funniest individuals in America. This film is an animated musical, but parents beware, it doesn\\'t bare the Disney family-friendly stamp of approval. The best songs in the film are \"Up There,\" \"I\\'m Super,\" \"What Would Brian Boitano Do?,\" and the infamous \"Blame Canada,\" which was nominated for an Oscar. The best voice jobs by the creators were Saddam Hussein (Matt Stone,) and Satan (Trey Parker.) I could watch this film twenty times every day and never tire of it. Caution: while this film is animated, it is certainly not for the kiddies. It is filled with vulgar language, but it is not gratuitous. The language used is the purpose of the film. The moral of the film is that no matter what words your children learn from a film, it is not the filmmaker\\'s job to raise your child. It\\'s an anti-censorship film. It is the up to the parent to put it into context and punish accordingly. I would recommend this film to everyone who is not easily offended or an extreme Christian, YOU WILL BE OFFENDED. If you\\'re into satirical cartoons, or just want to see Canadians drop bombs on Alec Baldwin, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is a must-see.<br /><br />',\n"," 'Its a shame that this sitcom gem was lost to us due to constant preempting. I\\'ve never thought the rating system was all that fair. They should not include moments when prime time shows fall victim to breaking world newscasts, presidential addresses, special mini-series broadcasts, and holiday specials...its just not an accurate assessment of a show\\'s viewer base. That said, maybe some reviewers are right that the audience wasn\\'t \\'there\\' yet, as the D&D gaming crowd was still mostly a little young to fall into the demographic they were shooting for...but I certainly loved it! And pay no heed to the comments of \\'Oh Dear, Oh Dear\\'...that person obviously had no idea that the show wasn\\'t there as a serious attempt to promote D&D to the masses...it was a COMEDY...a silly, camped-up comedy (like \"Men In Tights\\' was to the Robin Hood franchise). And a good one at that! Julia Duffy was so memorable and funny as the spoiled, self-absorbed Princess Ariel that when she re prised that type of role as Stephanie on the \\'Newhart\\', for the first season she was on that show I just saw her as The Princess...and that alone kept me watching \\'Newhart\\'! I was never much a Jeff Conway fan, but the show gave me a better appreciation for him. And the villain stole the scene (or at least what part of it he could pry away from Duffy) every time he took the screen. I always thought his name was Derek Blackpool..to me that seems funnier somehow than Dirk (maybe because it rhymes with Eric?). Perhaps after a couple of decades of having seen it, its like Dark Shadows...you remember it as scarier (or in this case, funnier) than it actually was (and we\\'ll sadly never know now how good it could have been), but I would love to go back and watch it again. I don\\'t recall if it had a laugh track, but I don\\'t think it would have needed one if it is indeed as funny as I recall. I was sad to see it go, and like another poster, didn\\'t realize it was gone until it didn\\'t come back. As a baby-boomer, I\\'d like to see more pop-culture related sitcoms like this revived rather than more waste-of-time reality shows.',\n"," 'Anthony LaPaglia stars as Leo Waters, a Chicago-based architect whose domestic life is not as stable as his professional; to wit: his eldest child, Martin (Sebastian Stan), has just dropped out of college and his aimlessness leads to an unlikely assignation; his youngest, daughter Christina (Hayden Panettiere, currently on NBC\\'s hit series \"Heroes\" as the cheerleader impervious to pain), whose blossoming into young womanhood is proving to be a painful event; and his wife Julia (Isabella Rossellini), a homemaker whose anal retentive disposition is masquerading some still waters running deep. To add further complication, enter Tonya Neeley (Viola Davis), a woman crusading for a petition to have her housing project building be torn down. Convinced the design is the main culprit to the tragic underpinnings of her situation, Tonya elicits Leo\\'s help by forcing him to sign her petition, figuring his name will get the civic wheels in motion. Leo naturally declines, since his ego in check will not recognize that this is the blame for the building\\'s plague of problems (i.e. drug dealing on the premises and general vandalism). But that will not stop Tonya\\'s quest for closure.<br /><br />Based on a play by David Greig, a Scottish playwright, novice director Matt Tauber (a fellow American playwright and film producer making his debut here), adapts with a leaden storyline that mars a genuine plot point: how does housing truly affect its populace. He instead sets up one unlikely premise (Martin suddenly having a gay encounter; Christina lamely seducing a truck driver; Julia going off her nut, et al) that serves no real pay off and loses interest in Tonya\\'s plight (it is apparent that she lost one child, while her surviving off- spring are so disparate they may as well be strangers), which should have been the central focus. <br /><br />While the storytelling misses its mark however the acting is on-target. LaPaglia, one of my favorite actors, gives a complex yet sublime turn as the slightly arrogant and apparently clueless titular character. He is matched note for note by Davis (last seen on screen in a small yet memorable performance in Oliver Stone\\'s \"World Trade Center\"), imbuing Tonya with dignity yet allowing her inner indignations brim to the surface not unlike a Sameul L. Jackson character.',\n"," '10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration (and music). I\\'ll do each one separately:<br /><br />Nicolas Roeg (dir)--Giuseppe Verdi (music). A story about an assassination attempt in 1931 Vienna. Theresa Russell (Roegs wife) plays a man! Not bad--very beautiful and exotic. Russell is great.<br /><br />Charles Sturridge--Verdi. No story but there is some haunting black and white imagery that fits perfectly with the music.<br /><br />Jean-Luc Godard--Jean Baptiste Lully. Horrendous. Pointless, boring, no plot, no nothing. Filled with gratuitous female nudity. The worst!<br /><br />Julien Temple--Verdi. Buck Henry, Beverly D\\'Angelo and Anita Morris star in this funny, if obvious, story about a cheating couple. Pretty good.<br /><br />Bruce Beresford--Erich Korngold. Short, lush and romantic. Very good.<br /><br />Robert Altman--Jean-Philippe Rameau. Dull. A yawner.<br /><br />Fran Roddam--Richard Wagner. This has Bridget Fonda in her film debut. Beautifully done love story with a fairly explicit sex scene. <br /><br />Ken Russell--Giacomo Puccini. Really strange but OK.<br /><br />Derek Jarman--Gustave Chapentier. Lyrical look at youth and old age. Very sweet. <br /><br />The last is by Bill Bryden doing \"I Pagliacci\". He has John Hurt (!) dressed as a clown lip-syncing to Caruso (!!!).<br /><br />When this came out it almost got an X rating (for the abundant nudity and the sex scene). It was given an R with a strict warning attached saying the R rating would be heavily enforced. After the film bombed that warning disappeared.<br /><br />The idea isn\\'t bad and 6 out of the 10 segments were worthwhile. Worth seeing even if you don\\'t like opera.

The plot is a cheap rehash of the first, which is weird, since it's supposed to be a prequel, not a sequel. Pretty much the entire movie seems like a cheap remake of the first, with scenes mimicking the things that happened in the first, only a lot more ridiculous and unlikely. Where the first had a great cast, this one consist of B-list actors and rejects. The acting is mostly horrendously bad. Half of the good lines in the movie are taken directly from the first, as is nearly every major character, including the ones who weren't in the first movie. I realize this was made up by a TV series pilot episode, but that's no excuse. They didn't have to turn the (bad) footage into a movie. Only one thing is marginally good, and that's the erotic sequences. However, as these are nowhere near as good as the ones in the first, even this isn't raising it above a rating of 1. If you have a chance to see it for free, and you're a straight guy, it could be worth checking out, if you want something erotic that isn't porn.

The setting is 1906 Wyoming where life had not changed much since the previous century. The film keeps your interest without the added Hollywood myths. The whole family can see this movie and be intrigued about how life was like in America when it was mostly a rural nation. With this film, you will escape the present and witness the daily life of 100 years ago. In a beautiful, scenic environment you will see the hard physical work that was required to survive, as well as the constant worries and concerns of the elements and the market pressures that will make a difference between success or failure. See this movie and experience life as it was for most of our nation's history. This film is worth your time to see.

The acting was bad, the plot was tweaked too much, and the humor was surprisingly very crude.<br /><br />It starts with Conrad and Sally, A rule breaker and a future sheriff. When their Mother has to go to work, she gets Mrs. Kwan to babysit. Possibly the lone funny part in the movie is when Mrs. Kwan is watching a Taiwanese court room, a `la C-SPAN. She soon falls asleep, and here comes the Cat.<br /><br />The film starts to spiral out of control. The Cat came to try to let the kids have some fun. He\\'s got Thing 1 and Thing 2, Who suddenly start trashing the house. He improvises a TV Infomercial, and accidentally slices his tail off. And when the Cat goes full Carmen Miranda, it\\'s not funny. Possibly his only funny disguise is as a hippie activist. And there\\'s a fish who tries warning the kids about the Cat.<br /><br />Too bad he didn\\'t warn us this film was as much fun as sour milk, or chopping your tail off.<br /><br />Soon the kids are outside looking for the family dog, who has the key to a crate on his collar. If the crate is not locked soon, their house will be home to the Cat\\'s universe. Here it gets a little more interesting, but not enough to save the film.<br /><br />The acting, overall, is horrible. Mike Meyers brings his brand of irreverent Austin Powers humor to the Cat, Saying things like \"You dirty ho\" and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after a whack in the testicles while posing as a pinata. Spencer Breslin is great as the trouble-making Conrad, and Dakota Fanning is cute as Sally, though they alone are not enough to save this horrendous Aortic Dissection waiting to kill John Ritter(accident waiting to happen). Alec Baldwin\\'s slick and slimey Lawrence Quinn is disgusting, ever trying to woo the kids mom, who is played by Kelly Preston.

Ram Gopal varma manages to take a melting pot of talent and create a dish so stale u can smell it from a distance. To take a classic like Sholay and assassinate it is totally unforgivable and I can\\'t believe he almost called the movie RGV ki Sholay. Although Sholay had a lot of folklore elements in it, the movie managed to build on its plot by merely defining the characters so distinctively that they lived on forever. What Aag does is take these characters and mess them up so badly u\\'ll need a contest to pick the worst. The realism element is totally missing and what the movie ends up providing is a bunch of \"actors\" parading along in a plot less and seemingly unrelated set of events.

It was less pretentious and more entertaining. In summary: this is a boring, pointless, old-fashioned film. I have watched this kind of story before, better written and executed by many directors, v.g.: Luis Buñuel, Carlos Saura and Peter Weir (Please take a look at \"Picnic at the hanging rocks\") only to name three of them.

The father and mother still pay homage to the 50's and cling to to the ideal of raising a home when it is obvious the kids are already grown and moving on. There is a sense of transition and transformation strong for both parties and you feel the pivot turn. <br /><br />The girls all each savor a little growing up, unique and personal to themselves while the parents become lost in failed expectation and guilt about the loss of a child years earlier.\",\n"," \"I had not seen Dial M for Murder before I watched this film, so I had very few expectations about this film. I felt that the actors did well in the roles that they played, although this is not one of Michael Douglas's best roles (I think one of his better performances was in Romancing the Stone, or Wall Street).

Roger Moore did this movie in between \"Moonraker\" and \"For you eyes Only\" and it was a nice departure from the Bond character. Anthony Perkins is convincing as the hijack leader and also fittingly comical. James Mason is a bonus and charming as usual.<br /><br />The story centers around Rufus Excalibur (Moore); a heavy drinking, confident, cocky and intelligent specialist. He is like the equivalent of an ex-Navy seal of some sort. He leads a team that focuses on water dives, stealth and ship recovery tactics. Rufus is the best, of course, and expects a lot from his Men. He is never satisfied but that is some of the humor as well. Rufus also dislikes Women, is crazy for Cats and has a lot of money.<br /><br />Basically a hijack team overtakes a boat and its crew and holds 2 large oil rigs, Ruth and Jennifer, for ransom via bombs attached to them. Rufus is called in to lead the recovery and the story fluctuates between the hijackers and the crew and Rufus\\' life, preparation and style. The rest is primarily climactic and the adventure, action and humor all fall into place the last hour of the movie.<br /><br />If you are a Roger Moore fan, see this movie solely for that. You will be pleasantly surprised. Also, see it because it is still a solid movie after 22 years and I still am entertained after 20+ viewings.<br /><br />Unfortunately there is no DVD version, but it is for sale and possibly for rent.

Through Fonda's performance we are led to believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was a country bumpkin. But, through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings, you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him. <br /><br />In this movie Henry Fonda shows that he has a very good grasp of how to present humor. It is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years. When he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing down perfect. There is a sequence in the trial that had me laughing quite hard. He shows this gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940.<br /><br />The ending by John Ford is absolutely brilliant with Henry Fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the Civil War.

Miller.<br /><br />Released in 1938 in the new Technicolor of the time, \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" was the one film that not only launched the career of actor Errol Flynn but that of his co-star Olivia De Havilland as well as director Michael Curtiz and even elevated Warner Bros Studios to a new level of greatness, simply because this film boasts a strong cast and oozes with grand old Hollywood spectacle. The popular folk legend of the heroic outlaw Robin Hood is an old one, dating back to the time of the Medieval Crusades and the reign of King Richard the Lion-Hearted. Errol Flynn brought the familiar character to brilliant life in every detail of his performance; from the physicality of his acting (he did all his own stunts!) to the accurate \"Robin Hood\" mannerisms, language, accent and even laugh. He was exactly what audiences felt Robin Hood should be. It\\'s even likely he inspired the later Disney animated version of Robin Hood in the 60\\'s, in which the characters were animals. The story of Robin Hood has endured over the years because it\\'s at heart a classic tale of heroism. The social outcast Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men,despite lacking the comforts of home and titles, save a then feudal England from the corruption of the Sheriff of Nottingham and the usurper Prince John. While righting wrongs, Robin Hood falls for the noblewoman Maid Marion. Can he defeat the evil Prince John and restore the rightful king Richard to the throne ? A notable cast heads up the film. Rising star Olivia De Havilland is pretty, elegant, charming and yet very resourceful as Maid Marian, and her chemistry with Robin Hood is electrifying. She would later become far more than just Errol Flynn\\'s leading lady and win two Oscars for strong dramatic performances in the 40\\'s for \"To Each His Own\" and \"The Heiress\" and her acting career lasted over 30 years. What we see in her as Maid Marian is a young Olivia De Havilland, a new arrival in Hollywood. But the rest of the principals were established stars. Actor Basil Rathbone, who plays Sir Guy of Gisbourne, had been a silent film star of swashbuckling adventure films. Claude Rains (Prince John) was popular at this time and would continue to enthrall audiences with great performances over the years, including his memorable films \"The Invisable Man\" and the \"talkie\" \"Phantom Of The Opera\". Claude Rains as Prince John is a nasty piece of work, blinded by ambition and ruthless in his pursuit of power, hoping to rule England in the absence of King Richard (Ian Hunter) who is portrayed as a lost adventurer himself. Having fought in the Crusades, he comes home to an England he hardly recognizes and one that does not recognize him. Melville Cooper portrays the corrupt Sheriff of Nottingham.<br /><br />The Merry Men of Sherwood Forest, including Patrick Knowles as the dashing Will Scarlett, Alan Hale as the burly Little John and Eugene Palette as the godly Friar Tuck are also what audiences imagined they would be. When the characters are not fighting, plotting or saving the day, there is a considerable amount of humor, especially in such characters as Bess, portrayed by Una O\\'Connor, who serves as lady-in-waiting to Maid Marion. This film had two directors, Michael Curtiz and William Keighley because during this time in Hollywood, the more ambitious, expensive or difficult-to-produce films normally needed extra direction. But it is Michael Curtiz who garnered fame and he would later direct Errol Flynn in other successful films such as the Elizabethan adventure \"The Sea Hawk\" and the pre-Civil War epic \"Santa Fe Trail\" in which Flynn was once again paired with Olivia De Havilland. This film is a winner and a classic slice of old Hollywood.',\n"," 'An absorbing exploration of virtual reality, although it is not yet clear how much the director himself intended. This film deliberately takes you through several layers of artificial reality, leaving only subtle clues about which layer of virtual reality you are in, positing an ontological confusion for the viewer to ponder. <br /><br />Also can be seen as a satire of video games-- the whole movie though may fall into the fallacy of imitative form here. It seems unable to escape from the video game genre which it imitates; thus the satire becomes problematic. <br /><br />A number of interesting ideas crisscross throughout though: the biological mutant is one; the interface of technology and biology, the cyborg urge to transcend reality-- and philosophical allusions such as the title\\'s to Heidegger, along with existential questions: i.e., the game characters are partly scripted or determined and yet partly free to alter their fate, and they wonder at how strange that feels in the game. One character then notes that this existential confusion is just like real life, thereby erasing again the distinction between the virtual and the real. Likewise with the observation that it is unpleasant to stumble around in a world where you don\\'t know what will happen next and you\\'re not sure how to play since you have to stumble around just to find out the goal and the unknown rules. A virtual game within the game is titled \"TranscendenZ\". Also a critique of how virtual violence makes us unable to feel the effects of real violence. Even the heroes at every level of ontological existence find themselves confused about violence. They don\\'t like it but it is thrilling and part of the \"game\", which then they fear is real. <br /><br />The game creator, the god of the system, is assassinated in the end; yet that very scenario is played out in direct parallel to a video game we\\'ve just witnessed-- and the onlookers believe that it is still just part of the virtual reality. In the end, the film does not resolve the doubt about whether or not this is \"real\" but the point is clear (to me anyway). Existenz means Da-sein: You are there. You are thrown into a set of rules and mysteries at every level. Ontologically, virtual reality recapitulates reality. And its common game motifs express, like a royal road to the unconscious, our own fascination with violence.<br /><br />Nevertheless, while Cronenberg affirms these philosophical allusions in an interview about the film, he claims that he is very much against the \"Reality ... {underground name of terrorist group} portrayed in the film both in the game and in the \\'real\\' level.\" Seems that Cronenberg himself did not put that much thought into the film, though his impressive education comes through. The interview in Cineaste gives the impression of a middle brow intellectual who\\'s trying to be avant-garde by inclination. Cronenberg is simply on the side of free imagination -- the clichéd bourgeois modernist credo-- despite the acknowledged ambivalence there. (My impression here might be due to one limited interview.) Still, Cronenburg seems to miss the point that his film betrays the fallacy of imitative form (here imitating computer games while doing a satirical critique of them, but a critique that is unable to \"transcend\" the same form) probably because he actually thinks that it is \"imaginative\" and radical. Yet the film\\'s imaginative world is less bearable, and more jejune, than our own all-too-real world. It remains trapped in the computer game worldview.',\n"," \"I have loved this movie ever since the first time I saw it years ago when I was a preteen.

Just relax and let him take you on a ride through his world, you'll love it.\",\n"," 'This is a pretty routine crime drama involving narcotics in New York. The SS Florentine docks and unships a crate of medical dope but instead of dope there is nothing but sand in the crate. The purser has stolen it, with the complicity of one of the passengers, a Miss Toni Cardell. Two Treasury agents, Scott Brady and Richard Rober, latch on to the case and track the dope through a network of heavies and murderers led by Yul Brynner. They succeed with the help of the U. S. Coast Guard and at the cost of Brady\\'s life.<br /><br />Right away, though, I had a slight problem in that nobody anywhere is named Miss Toni Cardell. It\\'s the kind of echt-schiksa name that somebody might dream up because it sounded right, like \"Ellie Arroway\" in Carl Sagan\\'s novel, \"Contact.\" But just try to find a name like Toni Cardell in a phone book, especially in Shanghai. I dare you.<br /><br />Secondly, the crate carrying the dope is opened by customs agents. It\\'s a big crate, the size of a wardrobe, and it\\'s filled entirely with sand. A reasonable inference is that a LOT of dope is missing, yet when the box of narcotics is finally discovered in a locker at Grand Central Station, it\\'s only big enough to contain, say, three dictionaries.<br /><br />Those, of course, are minor things. Yet this is a minor movie. It\\'s a routine track-\\'em-down mystery with T-men putting themselves in danger by posing as somebody else. Scott Brady is okay. He\\'s an Irishman with Burt Lancaster\\'s habit of sticking out his jaw in a defiant scowl when he\\'s angry. It\\'s rather likable. His partner, Richard Rober, on the other hand, has practically nothing to offer, a bland, acceptably handsome contract player. He\\'s the one who should have been knocked off early on, allowing Scott Brady to continue the chase.<br /><br />Best performance, hands down -- Yul Brynner with hair as the Vladimir Putin look-alike who heads the whole operation. What a background the guy had. A Jew from Sakhalin Island off the Siberian coast, a stint at the Sorbonne in Paris, a trapeze artist. \"The King and I\" brought him fame but left him socked into a domineering and unsubtle persona. Here, he gives his most earnest performance. He\\'s suave, handsome, delicate even. And -- this being 1949, the year when the Cold War became an undeniable fact -- his Russian accent fits the temporal template. He\\'s better here than he ever was later.<br /><br />But, taken as a whole, what we have here is an inexpensive Eagle Lion crime drama with self-sacrificing heroes and ruthless villains. Nice to see the Coast Guard in action. Even if, to pump up the action, the writers and Lazlo Benedict, the director, have Brynner shooting his snub-nosed revolver at an 83-footer armed with a 20 millimeter cannon on the bow.<br /><br />Diverting, yes, but not much new.',\n"," 'Chuck Norris played this movie to the limit!!!

He referred to an example of, say, if he ran over a dog while on his way to act in a play that it wouldn\\'t be the end of his life but that it would affect him, and that, without a doubt, he would have to bring that experience with him on stage even if it was a light comedy. \"Otherwise,\" as he said, \"what am I doing?\" I couldn\\'t help but think of his words when watching Gena Rowland\\'s character, Myrtle Gordon, who for almost a whole week or so goes through a very similar scenario. There is more to this in Cassavetes\\' film, of course, since it\\'s about how the theater works around a star actress, what emotion and human nature mean when looking at playing a character, and how one lives when all one has (like Myrtle Gordon) is the theater.<br /><br />Near the beginning of the film, after exiting a performance, Myrtle is signing autographs and one such fan named Nancy comes up to her favorite star and pours her heart out to Myrtle. It\\'s a touching little moment, but it doesn\\'t last as she has to get in the car (pouring rain and all). She then watches in horror as the girl, who stood right next to the car as it drove off, gets hit by another car in an auto accident. She\\'s not sure really what happened, but then finds out the next day that in fact the girl did die from the hit. From then on she\\'s sort of stunned by this even after she thinks it\\'s out of her system. At first this shows in small ways, like when she rehearses a scene with her fellow actor (played by Cassavetes) and can\\'t seem to stand being hit - she blames it on the lack of depth in the character (the writer: \"What do you think the play lacks?\" \"Hope,\" says Myrtle)- but then Nancy starts to show up to her, an apparition that to Myrtle is all to real, until she\\'s suddenly gone.<br /><br />Cassavetes, as in the past films, is after a search for what it means to have emotion, to really feel about something and feel it, or the lack thereof, and how it affects others around the person. This isn\\'t exactly new ground for Rowlands, who previously played a woman on the edge of herself in Woman Under the Influence (in that case because of alcohol), nor would it be alien territory for costar Ben Gazzara, who just came off starring in Killing of a Chinese Bookie. But the actors express everything essential to their characters in every scene; Cassavetes doesn\\'t tell them how to get from A to B in a scene, and he doesn\\'t need to. There\\'s a mood in a Cassavetes film that trumps the sometimes grungy camera-work. You know Myrtle, for example, should be content somehow, even if it isn\\'t with the plot. But she\\'s haunted, and is unsatisfied with her character\\'s lack of depth and the tone of the play (\"Aging, who goes to see that?\" she asks the playwright), and it starts to affect those around her too.<br /><br />The question soon becomes though not what is the usual. A conventional dramatist would make the conflict \\'Will she be able to go on stage, will the show go on?\\' This isn\\'t important for Cassavetes, even if it\\'s there, as is the question \\'Will she be alright?\\' Perhaps going through such a grueling play as \"The Second Woman\" could help her work out her personal demons and her losing her grip on reality (seeing Sara and attacking her in front of total strangers, who wonder what the hell is going on)? Or will the play\\'s lack of hope strain everything else wrong with her? The depths Rowlands makes with her character are intense and harrowing, and that it\\'s expected doesn\\'t mean it\\'s any duller than Woman Under the Influence- if anything, it\\'s just as good as that film at being honest about a person in this profession, and consequently the other performances are just as true, from Gazarra to Nancy played by a subtle Laura Johnson. Cassavetes answers to his own posed questions aren\\'t easy.<br /><br />One of the real thrills of Opening Night, along with seeing great actors performing an amazing script, is to see Cassavetes take on the theater the way he does. We see the play performed- and it\\'s apparently a real play- and we only know slightly what it\\'s about. When we see the actors on the stage performing it, we wax and wane between being involved in what melodrama is going on (relationship scuffling and affairs and the occasional slap and domestic violence) and the improvisation of the actors. I wondered watching how much really was improvised, how much Cassavetes allowed for the other actors to do in the scenes where Myrtle starts to go loopy or, in the climax, is completely smashed. He\\'s on the stage, too, so it must have been something for them to work it out beforehand and let what would happen happen.<br /><br />It\\'s funny, startling, chilling, and edge-of-your-seat stuff, some of the best theater-on-film scenes ever put in a movie, and we see the lines between actor on stage, actor on film, actor with actor, blur together wonderfully. Opening Night is a potent drama that is full of frank talk about death and madness, reality and fiction, where the love is between people, and really, finally, what does \\'acting\\' mean?',\n"," 'Apartmente\\'L is one of the most interesting movies that I have ever seen. I experienced extreme frustration while watching this movie as I was gunning for the two leads to reunite. That never happened in the end which disappointed me to no end. But the ending lends an even more cynical touch to a generally cynical movie. It is not a movie which people are likely to rewatch but one watch itself will have a deep impact on people. As of now I haven\\'t rewatched the movie and I don\\'t think I will.<br /><br />The story follows the experiences of a man, Max, who is engaged to be married to Muriel. He remembers his old girlfriend Lisa(he considers this the love of his life) as he listens, by accident, to Lisa talking on the telephone. Thus he tries to find Lisa. Here starts his extremely frustrating search for Lisa. There are many layers to this movie. There are undercurrents of jealousy, vouyeurism and so on. There is also another character called Alice who is involved in the whole confusion. The movie then moves through a whole range of twists and finally leads to an ending which could be interpreted in many ways. It is fascinating how this movie has only four main characters but the clever writing makes it interesting and unique. What I love about the fact is that a movie about obsession, jealousy is done in such a light hearted manner. It has a very fast pace which is probably the reason why it can appeal to a large audience. The main character, Max, has shades of grey and I felt the ending was perfect. I don\\'t think he is supposed to be a clean character considering the fact he is searching for his long lost love while he is engaged and he also has a fling with Alice.<br /><br />The character of Alice is even worse. Her manipulation and her compulsive lying can really irritate viewers(that is the point, I guess). The scene where she breaks down in front of Lucien really shows another facet of her character. It shows a side of her that wants to be accepted and that she is tired of all the lying and the games and she wants to lead a normal life. In the end, she understands that she needs to get away from it all. The ending lends a cynical touch. Because it seems as if Max\\'s love for Alice is temporary and fake. It is as if to say that love in general is a temporary emotion and it is better to choose the safe option(i.e Muriel) than to pursue something that is so fleeting(i.e Lisa or Alice). In many ways this is not really a romantic movie but a satire about romance(in a way).<br /><br />The performances deserve high praise. Vincent Cassel as Max gives a great performance. He perfectly portrays the confusion of a man who is not really sure about his engagement. His geeky looks are an added advantage as it fits the character perfectly. But the real star of the movie is Romane Bohringer as Alice. Her nuanced portrayal of a woman who is jealous of Alice and is in love with Max. The scene where she screams \"I am a nutcase too\" really shows her desperation and her yearning to live a normal life with a man who loves her.<br /><br />Btw I also thought lesbianism is another interpretation that can be drawn from this movie. Alice\\'s actions can be explained in many ways. And her unreasonable obsession with Lisa may also be explained as a manifestation of a lesbian desire. It may be far-fetched considering she encourages Lisa to forgive her current boyfriend. But I got the feeling that she was a lesbian for a long time. She also avoids questions from Lisa regarding a boyfriend. She spends a whole lot of time with Lisa and she is happy during that time. That may lead many to question her sexual orientation.<br /><br />Overall I would give it a 9/10. I think it deserves it but I subtracted one because of the rewatchability factor. I think it is a perfect movie otherwise.',\n"," 'By the end of the movie, Chad Donella is forced to choose between an ex-model with a innocent personality, and a Once overweight girl with low self esteem, and a personality that is just as sweet the model, only not as accommodating to rejection.

I\\'m not a lover of porn or of violence-as-entertainment, but what of them I chance upon I tend to see camera angles, cuts, pans, lighting, rhythms, nearly to the exclusion of fear or titillation, sometimes even missing filmmakers\\' or actors\\' intent. Even from footage that reasonable people may argue should never have existed, I always imagine there\\'s something to learn. I wonder more at how a film does than about what it does. Maybe that\\'s wrong of me. Wiser but harder than deconstructing unpleasant cinema, might be to see cuts, pans, etc., at one with and inseparable from no matter what content. I ask myself what horror filmmakers and church architects have in common. Add in political filmmakers, fascist and not. All manipulate with light, space, and sound in order to alter perception and mood. How different are their goals? How different are the goals of those who film real atrocities for use as propaganda? <br /><br />When the original All Night Long (ANL) trilogy appeared on my shelf, I left it unwatched for nearly year. Curiosity had made me buy it. I sampled a few minutes of \"1\" the day it arrived, up to the awkwardly sound-effected street corner stabbing that seems really an attack on film viewers\\' sensibility, found it inept but effective. I\\'d have to come back to it, certainly, but didn\\'t relish the prospect. Clearly this wasn\\'t the sublime horror of Kairo, Cure, Angel Dust, Lain, the rawer but still traditionally framed horror of the first Evil Dead Trap, the overtly political work of Koji Wakamatsu, or even the brilliant crudity of early Cronenberg.<br /><br />Maybe that word \"attack\" is key. Matsumura attacks not his characters, but his viewers. I can\\'t watch these at this point in history without thinking of both Abu Garib (some of which I think I recall was evidenced on video) and the hostage videos, but also about Godard\\'s torturers (in Le Petit soldat?) to whom atrocity is just a job, a fraction of a person\\'s workday. And then there\\'s the prolonged Northern California news story whose details I barely remember but can\\'t entirely forget because it too entails \"cinema,\" a duo of serial killers notorious, if suggestion isn\\'t playing games with my memory, for having videotaped themselves torturing victims.<br /><br />All three ANL entries are revenge cinema, vigilante exercises, but I\\'m attaching these notes ANL3 because it\\'s the most ambitious and may constitute a turning point for director Matsumura. (I haven\\'t seen the entries that followed ANL3.) Through the first two offerings, I imagined a camera fallen into the hands of one of those fringe kids from middle or grammar school who obsessively draw war scenes or other atrocities. (Or as if one of Matsumura\\'s revenge-crazed characters had turned writer-director. Anyone watching these who hasn\\'t seen Michael Powell\\'s Peeping Tom would do well to see it.) But ANL3 seems to aspire to mainstream. Matsumura\\'s protagonist grows carnivorous plants, allowing for some typically Japanese cool close-up nature shots. There\\'s also, for the first time a Matsumura film, a traditionally erotic sequence: Kikuo\\'s female boss sneaks up and begins to caress him while he\\'s peeping at the love hotel\\'s customers. Kikou finds himself unhappily sandwiched between. He\\'s a middleman voyeur. The brief thrill comes from the layers of voyeurism. There\\'s even a philosophical/poetic garbage sifter, a garbage voyeur who somehow makes me think of the poem repeated in Wakamatsu\\'s not-at-all-what-it-sounds-like Go, Go, Secondtime Virgin.<br /><br />I\\'m getting nowhere with this, and it\\'s getting in the way of my commenting other films. Can\\'t escape the suspicion that a few years on I\\'ll walk into a Matsumura retrospective at my local film archive, maybe hosted by some learned character who\\'s caught onto something I\\'m missing.<br /><br />How much does it matter whether the director is or simply \"gets\" his lethally muddled protagonists? Does he even have to understand them? Maybe a director\\'s job is just to spew it out, then let critics, sociologists, and the rest of us hash things out. Maybe directorial or artistic responsibility is a bogus notion.<br /><br />My final struggle with this thing had me wondering what on earth a woman thinks watching these overwhelmingly male exercises.

It\\'s not considered as the ultimate Disney classic along side the more well-known Disney-films, but it\\'s a well-made and fun film that certainly deserves to be a Disney classic. \"Aristocats\" is certainly a sure kids-pleaser, cause it has all the components for a fun kids film. I\\'ll liked it very much as a kid. I\\'m not sure if this film is a sure pleaser to the adults, who could watch Disney classics for the nostalgia sake, but I still enjoy this film as an young adult.<br /><br />Storywise, \"Aristocats\" may not be so complex or innovative, but it doesn\\'t matter. This film was made on that period where the filmmakers followed the motto that the characters were the story and wise versa, which \"Aristocats\" certainly shows. The characters make the film; they\\'re all likable, fun, have great lines and have a great interaction with each other. The voice actors are also a part for making the characters so compelling (Eva Gabor as Duchess, Phil Harris as Thomas O\\'Malley and etc). A misconception could have been the dogs Napoleon and Lafayette, since they\\'re showstoppers and haven\\'t so much to do with the actual story, but fortunately they\\'re fun and amusing characters and the scenes with them are pure gold.<br /><br />\"Aristocats\" is both entertaining and cute, but it\\'s also a very funny cartoon. The animation style and look fits perfectly for the film\\'s French surroundings (especially the city of Paris looks greats). The character animation and design is great. And the songs are really catchy too. My favorite is \"Scale and Arpeggios\", but the title song is a cute song, along with \"Thomas O\\'Malley Cat\" and the memorable show-stopper \"Everybody Want\\'s To Be A Cat\". And the score by George Burns is a perfect fit for the film funny and emotional situations.<br /><br />Overall, \"Aristocats\" is in my opinion the best Disney cartoon from the 70\\'s and it\\'s a film that deserves to both be seen and remembered. So what you\\'re waiting for? Do your self a favor and share this Disney classic with your kids. It deserves to be in their memories.',\n"," 'The film Romero follows the career of Oscar Romero through his rise to power as the archbishop of San Salvador to his life in politics and ultimately his assassination. The film offers an insightful look into the political situation of El Salvador during the 1970\\'s. Like many countries of Latin America at the time, the nation was ruled by a brutal regime run largely by the military. Political assassinations and repression of all kinds were common place. The working people of El Salvador were also forced to endure the hardships of poverty and economic instability. The film is interesting to watch because it shows the controversy over the difficult roles that many in the Catholic Church felt compelled to play in the midst of the situation. According to the film, many in the Catholic Church, including many priests and eventually the archbishop himself, saw the political and economic situation in El Salvador as terribly unjust. Several priests began to speak out publicly on behalf of the people suffering in their congregations. This kind of political activism agitated the military regime and resulted in a crackdown on elements within the church including the assassination and repression of activist priests. As a result of this persecution, the newly appointed archbishop of San Salvador was forced to become more involved in the situation. As the political repression and injustice continued, the reluctant Oscar Romero began to speak more publicly on his opposition to the government and its policies. The film offers a remarkable insight into the political and cultural situation of the country. At the same time, the film documents the life and struggles of Oscar Romero during his tenure as archbishop of San Salvador.<br /><br />Much of the film\\'s drama is centered on Romero\\'s reluctance to get involved in the political debate that was engulfing his country. In fact, the film focuses as much on the character\\'s personal transformation as it does on his politics. According to the film, when Romero was instated as archbishop it was only because he was viewed as an intellectual moderate who would keep the church from getting too involved in the political affairs of the country. As the film progresses, however, the political repression becomes increasingly violent. With the assassination of a priest and the military\\'s desecration of the Eucharist in a Catholic church, Oscar Romero was shaken into action. He frequently began to speak publicly against the injustices of the political regime. It was interesting to watch Romero increasingly identify himself with the suffering of the people of El Salvador. At the beginning of the film, Romero was shown to have a close relationship with several of the wealthy elites that were controlling the country. Many of the military and political leaders attended his inauguration. He received gifts from them and enjoyed a close relationship with several powerful figures in San Salvador. As the film progressed, however, these relationships quickly began to deteriorate. As Romero increasingly identified with the suffering and persecuted people of El Salvador, his relationship with the ruling elites also began to suffer. In a particular scene, Romero declined to perform a private baptism for the child of a wealthy family. Instead, Romero told the family that they must baptize their child alongside all the other children at a regular Sunday Mass. The wealthy mother was horrified at the thought. It was this way that Romero increasingly began to identify himself with the lower-class people. In another scene, Romero is seen speaking on the radio about the church\\'s need to defend the needs of the poor and underprivileged in society. It was this kind of \"radical\" thinking that earned Romero enemies within the government. Eventually Romero\\'s \"agitations\" became too much for the military-backed government to bear. The film doesn\\'t say if it was the government or simply an overzealous supporter of the military-regime, but Romero was eventually assassinated for speaking out in support of the poverty-stricken masses of his country. Regarded as supporting communist subversives, the military leaders began to view the archbishop as a threat to their grip on power. The film ends with the dramatic assassination in which Romero was gunned down in the church while performing the communion ceremony for his congregation. At the end of the film, the text stated that in the nine years following the assassination or Archbishop Romero, more than sixty-thousand Salvadorians were killed under the military regime. To me, this film demonstrates the tragic brutality of many of the Latin American military regimes that emerged in the late 20th Century. After viewing this film, I have a newfound respect for the person and philosophy of Oscar Romero.',\n"," \"I have not read the novel this film was based on, but I did recently watch the 1980 version. While the modern version has better production values, sets, costumes, etc. I have to say that I favor the 1980 version.

Where was the mention that there was nuclear war in April 1998? Where was the confrontation between Haber and Orr? Having read a bit about the novel and having watched the interview with LeGuin, I know that the 1980 version was more faithful to the source material, and for that (as well as better performances from the two male leads) I have to recommend that version over A&E's Reader's Digest version.\",\n"," 'The first Home Alone was a decent enough film... the sequel was pretty much the same, at a new setting. This one tries to be original, and succeeds to some degree... of course, the formula is basically the same, so it\\'s like watching the same movie for a third time with slightly altered plot. The new score is quite bad(though the new \"setting traps\" piece was, if nothing else, interesting and different), especially compared to the grand score of the first, and the almost-but-not-quite-as-good score of the second. It (almost) makes up for it by using some pretty good non-original music, but it\\'s just not the same. The plot is fair, and somewhat original to the franchise, but it\\'s still basically the same movie as the first two, with worse acting and a less impressive example of the \\'scary character turning out to be good\\'.

The new thieves are less entertaining than the old ones(and they make fun of spy-stuff, which is almost criminal, given the limited amount of good spy flicks there are, and how precious few of them are cool). The fact that there are more of them(and thereby more traps) is just a weak attempt at trying to go one higher than the first two films... and it doesn\\'t work.

It\\'s also unnecessarily complex, as is the plot in general. I could follow it, but I doubt a kid could. Some of the exposition are delivered so obviously that even children may find it stupid. The animal stuff is generally not amusing. There are fewer siblings, which should mean that those there are get developed more, but they have less personality than the least featured of those of the first two films. All in all, just not particularly good, or worth watching, unless you *really* love watching criminals getting hurt in cartoon-y violence. I recommend this to huge fans of the series only. 3/10',\n"," 'I wouldn\\'t say this is a bad movie; in fact it\\'s pretty typical of the type of film that the \"poverty row\" studios were releasing at the time. Filmed for Monogram, Bela Lugosi is very effective in his role as the somewhat demented doctor-scientist, masquerading as a respected member of the community. In this movie, Bela and his henchmen have the nasty habit of stealing young brides, and, after their demise, injecting Bela\\'s wife with a serum taken from their bodies in order to keep her young. Lugosi is more than up to the task in making this an enjoyable film, however, the movie suffers from the ultra-wooden acting of co stars Luana Walters and Tristram Coffin. Coffin (nice name for a guy in a horror flick) is especially bad in this case. I\\'ve seen him in numerous movies and tv shows and he is always the same; stiff, wooden and utterly unconvincing. Miss Walters is only slightly better, but she too lacks the acting talent to make her role believable. Still, the viewer can enjoy the great Lugosi act out yet another dastardly scheme only to be foiled in the end! Despite the poor acting by some, \"The Corpse Vanishes\" is an enjoyable movie for all to see.',\n"," \"This is the second Hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second Hitchcock film I've seen in full, the first was Rope, which I really enjoyed. With Saboteur Hitchcock was more room to roam free, whereas Rope took place all in one room. I didn't enjoy this one as much as Rope but that's not saying this is a bad film, it just seems like an average flick that could have been something more.<br /><br />It seems like a film Hitchcock would make as a break in between his more serious ones. As a thriller, I feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the States. The climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension. The sound design is almost non existent. You can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them, but the important things are missing, the stitches ripping apart from the sleeve, the need of music to amp of the tension, all missing. Intentional no doubt, yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such a scene. Then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside.<br /><br />The film doesn't feel like it should either, they are almost globe trotting from place to place, yet it feels more confined. The script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse ways to get the plot moving.<br /><br />The performances are there, but nothing amazing. Everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page. The relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work. The one stand out is Otto Kruger, who has that rich, ego, evil persona down pat.<br /><br />In the end, I wanted more from this one. I understand it's one of Hitchcock's least exciting films, but I did have a good time watching it. I can recommend it, just not enthusiastically.\",\n"," 'Heath Ledgers acting in this film really bugs me, but overall its a great watch. Bryan Brown is excellent when i dont normally like him, but then his whole gang are a great piece of work.

Even the animated The Prince of Egypt was better.<br /><br />The one thing that threw me off was Ramses. Compared to Yul Brynner's version, Paul Rhys's version just seemed so weak and un-Pharoh like. The acting really wasn't that great. For a modern adaptation, I was expecting something better. It just didn't look as stunning visually as the first one. I guess they were running on a tight budget or something. There's an occasional voice-over narrator which I found strange and unnecessary. It also broke up the flow of the story. And um...God's voice/lines were kinda weird.\",\n"," 'Mel Brooks has brought out a couple of outrageously funny movies, and Leslie Nielson has starred in his own series, but this one measures up to neither standard, alas.<br /><br />One of the problems is that the original \"Dracula\" with Bela Lugosi was so perfect in its thingness that, after only a few viewings, it\\'s practically a self parody. In the 1930s version, Lugosi serves some drugged wine to Renfield. Renfield: \"Aren\\'t you having any?\" Dracula: \"I never drink -- wine.\" I doubt that the people involved in the production intended the line to be a joke, but that\\'s what it\\'s become. In Mel Brooks\\' version, the line is repeated and the camera holds on Leslie Nielson\\'s face, waiting for the laughs to die down.<br /><br />A second problem is that the gags vary from funny to silly, as is usual with Brooks, but there aren\\'t enough of either kind. We seem to follow the 1930s version fairly closely, almost as if it were to be taken seriously. And the jokes that pad out the scenes simply aren\\'t that amusing. In one conversation (in \"ancient Moldavian\") both Nielson and Brooks try to get the last word in. It drags on. And in the last scene of the movie, Brooks is alone with the coffin containing the now thoroughly cremated Nielson. He glances around, slyly opens the coffin an inch, and shouts in the last word of the ancient Moldavian conversation they\\'d had half an hour earlier, then slams the coffin shut and strides out with a look of satisfaction. If that\\'s the best that could be done for a climactic gag, well, there\\'s a problem.<br /><br />There are other problems. Brooks is okay in the part of Van Helsin, but Leslie Nielson is a bit old for the part of Dracula, and he doesn\\'t have the accent. (It ought to be overblown in a movie like this.) See George Hamilton do a better job with better lines in HIS Dracula parody, \"Love At First Bite\".<br /><br />It\\'s not a total waste and there are some funny moments. It\\'s just that there aren\\'t enough of them.',\n"," 'Man with the Screaming Brain is a story of greed, betrayal and revenge in the a small Bulgarian town. William Cole, wealthy industrialist, winds up with part of his brain replaced by that of a Russian cab driver Yegor. The two couldn\\'t be more different, but they share one thing - both were killed by the same woman. Brought back to life by a mad scientist, William and Yegor form an unlikely partnership to track down their common nemesis.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell returns to the B horror movie genre that gave him his cult status, this time not only in front of the screen, but behind the lens. Unfortunately for this time around, the laughs don\\'t deliver and Campbell has to resort to what he does best to try and fill the gap in this film.<br /><br />As a fan of Campbell, who has the movies, the books and the action figures, I was hoping for another hit to add to my collection. Although, after seeing this film before the purchase, I am glad that I don\\'t have the \"pleasure\" of adding it.<br /><br />The film first goes wrong in the story, which at first sight, seems like harmless fun but turns out to be boring drawn out dribble. Which is a sad thing to say because it was written by Mr. Campbell himself. The comedy never really hits, it only makes us scratch our heads. It seems that Campbell ran out of things that are funny and resulted in giving the audience what we\\'ve already seen...him fighting himself.<br /><br />Ted Raimi, the brother of Evil Dead director Sam Raimi, is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. He brings a freshness to it and an entertaining time when the film really needs it. It helps if you are a fan and have been following these stooges from Evil Dead to Xena, which is why I felt compelled to like this film.<br /><br />Campbell\\'s experience as a director, from directing episodes of the TV series Hercules is apparent. Campbell makes the film work well enough, even with the low-budget. In the end, there aren\\'t as many things going for this as one would hope for, but the fans of Campbell will stick behind it no matter what, unfortunately for this fan...I won\\'t.',\n"," 'I am not someone who insists that a movie adhere strictly to the book on which it is based. Moreover, I recognize that a teleplay must omit some parts of the book in order to fit in an 80-minute timeframe. However, I expect the essential theme of the book to be maintained. This adaptation fails miserably in that respect.<br /><br />Rather than paint a picture of the futility of playing God, writer Alan Sharp and director Philip Haas chose to give us a one-dimensional cliché of the self-aggrandizing scientist (James Caan\\'s Dr. Haber) and us a shallow love story. Haber\\'s desire to mold a better world through George Orr\\'s power, his attempt to convince George to join him in the effort rather than resist, and his inability to see that the consequences of meddling with reality are unpredictable -- all of this is lost in Haas\\' adaptation. Instead, we see Haber using George to obtain successively more magnificent office space and a progressively more fashionable secretary. George\\'s love interest, Heather, is reduced to an odd obsession; Heather\\'s own attempt (and failure) in LeGuin\\'s novel to use George\\'s power for public good never appears in Haas\\' film.<br /><br />Perhaps the pettiest departure from the book was Sharp and Haas\\' choice to have Dr. Haber say \"New York\" (instead of \"Antwerp\") as the phrase that induces George Orr\\'s dreams under hypnosis in their first session. Interestingly, Haber never uses the phrase again in any of the subsequent dream scenes. Maybe Haas was embarrassed by his own pettiness.<br /><br />Even as a standalone movie, this film is a poor one. Lisa Bonet\\'s character, Heather, was completely unbelievable. Are we really supposed to accept that a successful and self-assertive lawyer will drive out to a remote location and jump into bed with a psychiatric patient about whom she knows very little and that she will remain there with him for days in the face of his increasingly obsessive behavior - simply because he says he feels he knew her from a previous life? In another scene, we are given hints that George\\'s friend, Manny, may be more than he seems. He appears in each of George\\'s realities, and he seems to recall all of them. Yet the film does nothing with this; it is simply a loose string left for us to puzzle on. The final scenes are rushed and confusing, leaving the viewer with the sense that Haas simply ended the show in order to fit into the time he had available.<br /><br />Philip Haas has not made a decent movie since his 1995 `Angels and Insects.\\' This version of `The Lathe of Heaven\\' continues his streak of losers. If you want to see a good film adaptation of LeGuin\\'s book, buy the 1980 PBS version instead.',\n"," 'Kevin Smith made \"Clerks\" on low budget with a little help from his friends. That movie became a hit, and smith earn a cult reputation with it. Smith has to be a nice guy, because then he helped few Jersey friends with their projects. One of that friends was Brian Johnson, and his project was named \"Vulgar\".<br /><br />People are using words like original, shocking, vulgar, violent for this movie. And they are pretty right, but I add just one more \\x96 very bad.<br /><br />Brian O\\'Halloran who\\'s not a great actor to begin with, plays Will \\x96 blunderer, who works as clown at children parties. He doesn\\'t earn a lot of money, he drives old ramshackle car, and live in a hovel, when everyday he can be beaten by his neighbors. This movie starts like avenger comedy and goes from there in direction not many movies have a courage to go. It ends like pulp fiction drama.<br /><br />The problem is \\x96 this movie isn\\'t comedy, this movie isn\\'t drama, this movie doesn\\'t know what it is, and most important the director doesn\\'t know what moves makes a good movie, he doesn\\'t even got the clue. At the end it taste like \"bad acid-trip\" that tries to be rip-off of \"one of the pulp fiction rape story\". Its not the idea is total rubbish, it had potential, but execution is so bad its almost depressing.<br /><br />The one shining thing in this mess is of course Kevin Smith, playing gay TV-producer, he is really funny, and maybe Lewkowitz playing pretty scary villain. But thats about it. All of the stuff here, cinematography, editing, story are BAD, a not M.Jackson kind of Bad.<br /><br />Just one conclusion at the end \\x96 responsible for this mess is no one else but Kevin Smith, because sometimes helping your friends can lead to creating a really smelly monster. So shame on you Smith, shame on you.',\n"," \"This magnificent film about Liza Minnelli is one of the best films showcasing a popular entertainer at her prime. Bob Fosse directed with a keen eye and great panache. He gets the viewer involved in the performance and what the star is trying to accomplish. The music material by Kander and Ebb never sounded to poignant and fresh, as interpreted by Ms. Minnelli.<br /><br />The late 60s and early 70s brought forth an unusual talent, Liza Minnelli. She was at the time at the best moment of her career. She had a voice, youth, and she could move well, following Bob Fosse's choreography, designed to enhance the presentation.<br /><br />The film has been kept in mint condition and just recently released on cable. Fans of Liza Minnelli can rejoice in rediscovering that vibrant entertainer showing her public why she was a star on her own right.\",\n"," \"Even though it doesn't really matter to the film, this is a Creation myth. God (a convulsing, bloody figure in a chair) cuts his organs out with a straight razor and dies in His own filth. Mother Earth rises from his corpse and impregnates herself with his seed, giving birth to Man. It is, however highly unlikely for you to figure any of this out without reading a synopsis first, and it's not especially important to the film that you do, as it's more a surrealistic art-house imagery thing, all in inky, processed black and white. A sick, bleak atmosphere is created with the stark photography and minimal sounds (mostly water dripping, groans, scrapes, etc.) but each scene goes on a bit too long and so does the film as a whole. This could've been great as a short film, and the God killing himself scene was excellent and extremely creepy, especially being the first thing you see, but it's hard to be patient when it goes on for so long and you don't even know what you're seeing for much of the time.<br /><br />Still, a good film for the original style, images, atmosphere and content.\",\n"," \"Well it is about 1,000 years in the future and we have finally breached traveling the vast distance between galaxies!!

The 2 secretaries are nicely played by Dennie Moore and Penny Singleton.<br /><br />This was one of Kay's final film for Warners, and you'll note they had already demoted her to first billing but beneath the title. Her legal battles with the studio were front-page news in the late 30s. The studio put her in B films and then blamed her for slipping at the box office.

Anderson gets a bit suspicious when insurance investigator Sophie McCann,Wendy Hughes, informs him on some very fishy goings on between Fane and the insurance company Proud Alliance. It turns out that Proud Allience is actually owned, or 60% of it, by Fane himself! This explains whey Fane is having all these arson fires happen in order to collect the ten million dollars of insurance which is at least twice as much as the entire Valley View Estates is worth!<br /><br />We later have Sophie McCann murdered, in a faked swimming accident, to keep her from finding out whats happening with the suspicious fries around and in Valley View Estates.

Not the worst film ever but hardly the best either.<br /><br />The film looks alright with nice locations & some local scenery although you feel the look is down to the budget rather than the makers attempt a authenticity. There's not much gore apart from a decapitation & some broken off finger tips. For no apparent reason the makers throw in some average looking stop-motion animated monsters that really don't do anything or have much significance to the story.<br /><br />Filmed on the cheap by Charles Band's Full Moon Entertainment production company in Bucharest in Romania, the production values are alright & better than many later day Band productions. The acting isn't great with many of the cast putting in below par performances while genre regular Angus Scrimm has a small cameo at the start. There's a little bit of style here on occasion with a few scene reminding heavily of the original Nosferatu (1922) in particular the bit showing Radu's shadow coming down the stair with his long claw like fingernails standing out.<br /><br />Subspecies is a film that many seem to like for reasons I don't quite see, I thought it was throughly average at best & overall rather dull. Followed by Bloodstone: Subspecies II (1993), Bloodlust: Subspecies III (1994), Subspecies 4: Bloodstorm (1998) & the spin0off film Vampire Journals (1997).\",\n"," \"I can't believe anyone could rate this above a 5. Even sappy people will groan at this film. The characters all seem to be mentally retarded and have the emotional depth of 10 year olds. Really, this is a painfully bad movie that I would have walked out on except that I was too lazy to reach for the remote control which had fallen on the floor.<br /><br />Borderline soft-core porn is fine if you can actually believe it, but this movie was just a joke. The scene where Morgan Freeman wanders into the stadium to see two people getting it on actually made me laugh out loud, then I realized the only way to watch this film is to treat is as a joke, laugh and make Mystery Science Theatre 3000 style comments and you will have a good time.\",\n"," 'I was actually looking forward to seeing this movie because I have a step father who I often feud with. So naturally I was hopping this would cheer me up and get me to laugh. But boy did this movie depress me and boy did it make me angry.<br /><br />First let me go over what I did like about this film before I trash it. It had what could have been a really good and funny plot. Our lead character discovers that the evil gym teacher that tormented him in middle school is now going to marry his mother. Basically think of that teacher from high school or middle school who hated your guts. You didn\\'t do anything he/she just hated you and made it clear. Now imagine if that teacher going to be your new stepfather/stepmother. What do you do? This sounded hysterical and in the films defenses there were a few funny moments. Sadly however those funny moments were all given away in the trailer. This would be the first problem I had with this film. All the parts that come to mind as being the highlights were already spoiled and what\\'s left is okay but not great.<br /><br />However let\\'s talk about the story a little more. As I said before our star use to be stuck with an evil gym teacher who was out to make his life a living hell. Now he\\'s all grown up and has used his experiences with \"Mr. Woodcock\" to write a self help book. This book becomes a best seller and he now teaches people how to let go of there past. Things are going well until his past come back to hunt him! Now that also could of bin funny. Watching a mans message of letting go of the past get challenge by the bad things that happen to him long ago. Sadly it does not play out well and I will explain later.<br /><br />This Woodcock fellow dose not seem to regret any of the mean things he has done to him. In fact he\\'s very mean to everyone and everything. They made him such a jerk to the point you can\\'t bring your self to like his character. The mom on the other hand seem really nice but one cant help but wonder what is she thinking, is she that desperate? The guy makes very rude and mean spirited comments to her son, even going far to make sex comments about his mother. He treats the people in the town like dirt and everything that comes out of his moth is negativity and insults. Some time his abuse gets physical.<br /><br />So I was starting to think the story was about an evil step father who the son had to save his mother from marrying. After all for some reason he and us the viewer can only see what a bad guy Woodcock really is. But no. By the end of the movie the son must learn to Respect Woodcock and his very abusive ways. So according to the movie women are better off pretending there abusive spouse is a good guy in spite of the fact he treats the world like dirt. For all women can\\'t be happy unless they have a man, even if he is a creep. What kind of message is that to send out! Okay, dose our hero at least manage to persevere his message he has become popular selling? No, by the end he turns back on all of that and decided to take after his mom. Give into stock home syndrome and convinces himself that Woodcock is a good guy. So he finds himself apologizing to an unapologetic abusive jerk. He even declares that all the abuses was good for him. What kind of message are they trying to send out? Well did Woodcock learn any lessons, become sorry for his actions and show off that there is a nice guy in there some ware? As I already said no. They make it very clear he is not sorry for any the things he dose. In the movies Meet the Parents and Meet the Fockers, our lead faced a similar problem with his father in law to be. However that worked out on screen much better. Why? Because by the end the Character who was being a jerk learned his lesson and realizes he was in the wrong. Something that never happens here. The best we get is when Woodcock said \"I\\'m \"Basically\" sorry\" to the mom but after the entire movie one cant help but feel more mad then amused.<br /><br />To make things a little worse thing are never resolved. Like there a little romance going on between our star and a girl he knew from his old school but it never went any ware. In fact in one moment our \"hero\" cames off as a bit of jerk to because it seems he did not care much for her at all. So now our lead character not that likable earthier. Then when it gets to the end the movie feels as if it just stops. No laterally, it feels like it stop in mid-moment and then the credits start. Leaving the movie feeling unfinished and made to quickly.<br /><br />Over all what could of bin a good movie falls apart because things are never resolved, characters are unlikable, and sends out the message that abuse; verbal or physical is cool as long as your mom love him.<br /><br />That Why Mr. Woodcock gets a 3 out of 10.',\n"," 'As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly watches her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) being murdered by the vengeful hitmen Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera. In a state of complete denial and delusion, Betty escapes both physically and mentally from her unsatisfied, small town life to search for \"Dr. David Ravell\" (Greg Kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of \"A Reason to Love\", a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in Los Angeles. Immune to reality, Betty arrives in L.A. and becomes \"Nurse Betty\" as she tries to belong in the hospital world of her dream lover. Meanwhile, the angered Charlie and Wesley track Betty down, convinced she is a dangerous witness who also knows about their compromising dealings with Del.<br /><br />Nurse Betty creates comedy and suspense by contrasting its main character\\'s extreme innocence and optimism with the evident hypocrisy and violence that surround her. By clearly defining the protagonist\\'s difficult life, Nurse Betty justifies its character\\'s tendency to turn away from reality. Thus, while offering a comment about the popularity of the soap opera within the film, Nurse Betty also makes a comment regarding the widespread addiction to television and its celebrities. In addition, Nurse Betty benefits from the effective manipulation of its protagonist\\'s mental state, particularly in those scenes where she cannot distinguish between \"Dr. David Ravell\", the character, and George McCord (Greg Kinnear), the actor who plays him. Betty\\'s incapacity to recognize George as an actor leads to funny misunderstandings, which stress the magnitude of her delusional state. However, in spite of these successes, Nurse Betty suffers from the troubling characterizations through which the narration evolves. For example, while Charlie and Wesley are consistently portrayed as a comical pair, the brutality of their actions undermines any sense of appreciation or acceptance the viewer might have initially experienced. Similarly, although the initial scenes establish Del as a detestable man, the humiliation and violence he experiences with his murderers surpass all the humiliation and violence he caused his wife Betty.<br /><br />Finally, toward the end of the film, Charlie undergoes awkward transformations as he develops an obsession for Betty; an obsession which results in noble feelings of love, and which ultimately destroys him. Consequently, since the characters\\' roles as victims lack consistency, the story\\'s victimization processes seem random and unsubstantial. All in all, Nurse Betty\\'s indeterminacy --rather than creating suspense-- weakens its characters and pollutes its plot.<br /><br />',\n"," 'Opera opens with a very close-up shot of a bird\\'s ever-watching eye and thus begins one of Argento\\'s most bizarre, and enjoyable, features (my second favorite in fact, behind Deep Red). Granted, at times, the movie is pretty absurd (the lack of real concern after murders, the bird attack, the burnt dummy, that ending\\x85) but this is Argento\\'s fantastical world and once you come to terms with that, you\\'ll find that it works. I do not mean to completely dismiss these faults though, rather that the artistry of the film more than makes up for them. For example, the aforementioned bird attack is completely over-the-top in theory, yet look at the wonderful execution of it; crows flying in chaos, adding their enraged squawking to the driving rock beat, the crowd in panic as seen through the circling, bird\\'s-eye view camera-work, and then the focused attack; aria of terror indeed. Argento\\'s amazing, flowing cinematography is on full display in Opera, and clearly one of the film\\'s highlights. I also enjoyed the soundtrack of operatic themes and rock music, a nice contrast of music with each used effectively (the rock kicks in with the murders in perfect timing and gives the scenes a very frenzied feel). The sound effects deserve a nod too, stabs, scissors, beaks, and all.<br /><br />Inspector Alan Santini: \"I\\'ve seen a lot of your movies. Yes, you\\'re really an expert in this field. I\\'d be very interested to know your opinion.\"<br /><br />Marco: \"I think it\\'s unwise to use movies as a guide for reality, don\\'t you inspector?\"<br /><br />Inspector Alan Santini: \"Depends what you mean by reality.\"<br /><br />Being that this is a giallo, stylish murders are a must and Dario does not disappoint (the \"bullet through the door\" scene is quite possibly one of the greatest deaths ever shot, if you\\'ll forgive the pun). The black-gloved, deep-voiced, pulsating brained (cool shots!) killer is cold and brutal, and having him tape pins under our heroine\\'s eyes so that she was forced to watch the murders was a nice touch. That all said, as a giallo, Opera doesn\\'t quite have as good of a mystery as it should. The killer is kept secret from the audience well enough but there\\'s little effort in the film devoted to actually solving the murders. This, and the strange ending, could\\'ve used more work. Despite these problems though, Opera still manages to be a worthwhile and satisfying horror film.<br /><br />One final note: it was nice to see a movie, for once, show the correct view through binoculars (just a circle, not two circles together)! Nice eye for detail, Dario!',\n"," 'As bad movies go, this is pretty bad...which is pretty GOOD if you\\'re a bad-movie buff (like I am). But then what else would you expect when it stars Dennis Rodman? Surprisingly enough, Rodman is almost low-key, to the point where you could actually say he almost gives a decent performance. Almost. Still, it must be said his performance here is WORLDS better than in \"Double Team\", that classic of bad-moviedom. Perhaps because he\\'s almost restrained, the makers of this have decided to bypass intelligent character or plot development (a fact given away by its grammar-savvy title) and packed it with common-denominator bits that are dime-store quality even by the action genre\\'s sorry standards. And then there\\'s the acting...Dane Clark, as Rodman\\'s bumbling sidekick, pours it on thick with what is meant to be comic relief, but is neither comic nor relief; at NO MOMENT is he even BARELY amusing. If THAT were the very worst, it would be borderline tolerable, but oh no -- they\\'ve thrown in the comedy stylings of Ricky Harris & John Pinette as two computer-geek-slash-ass-kicking-slash -jive-slinging monks (monks!!!) who help and/or guide Rodman (it\\'s never really explained); John Pinette is an embarassment not only to actors, but comedians, fat people, monks and especially himself: \\'fat\\' jokes are one thing but nearly every opportunity is taken -- with his blessing and help! -- to show him eating, or shaking his bountiful belly, or wanting to eat...until, of course, at the movie\\'s climax, when he (or, rather, a stunt double) suddenly turns kick-boxing action star. Said scene provides the single most unintentionally funny moments: try holding back the laughs when it\\'s obvious Pinette\\'s double is only about 6 inches taller and 100 pounds lighter (despite the padding), and watch as a baddie is kicked over a bridge and actually SLOWS as he falls, thanks not to slow-mo but to the bungie cord. Oh, and then there\\'s the, ahem, \"special effects\". Can you say \"blue screen\"? The only member of this cast (designed to appeal to every possible international audience) that shows signs of real energy is Emma Sjosberg, who shares a thankfully-brief love scene with Rodman (she kisses him on the lips and does NOT vomit. Now THAT\\'S what I call \\'acting\\'!!!).<br /><br />',\n"," \"I was fairly lost throughout most of this film, and I am the one who usually understands the works of such enigmatic cinema greats as David Lynch (Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me) and Darren Aronofsky (Pi). Not to say that Northfork doesn't make sense on some level, it just doesn't combine to form a wholly coherent film. As time passes from watching the film, its themes and intentions become clearer, but during my initial viewing, I was really confounded, and I find that this is the major fault of the film...its lack of direction. The plot centers on the town of Northfork, Montana in the year 1955. The town has been emptied and will soon be flooded to make way for the creation of a hydro-electric dam. The major problem is that not all of its inhabitants are willing to be evacuated and relocated. A group of men are hired to coerce the remaining residents out of the town before it will be drowned, and for the most part they succeed amidst some fairly odd situations and townspeople. Simultaneously, the film tells the story of Irwin, a very sick young boy (or is he a fallen angel?) whose adopted parents gave him back, due to his illness, to the Northfork orphanage that they adopted him from. Father Harlan (Nick Nolte) cares for the dying Irwin, but Irwin imagines (or does he?!) that a group of angels (including Daryl Hannah and Anthony Edwards) have arrived in the desolate and empty town looking for a fallen angel. Irwin has scars on his back and on his head, and he tries to convince the angels that his scars are where the humans amputated his wings and halo. Oh yeah, and during all of this there is a strangely surreal walking animal on stilts that roams throughout the backdrop of the landscape. There are a lot of other small events that happen in the film, but none of them end up amounting to much more than momentary intrigue. One can appreciate the artistic quality of the film (it's obvious that the filmmakers cared deeply about this film) and its rich cinematography, but the film still tries too hard to be different and then gives up and whimpers to an end without making much of a statement. Like I wrote earlier, it becomes clearer, long after viewing, what has possibly taken place in the film. Irwin is dying, and so is Northfork, and in coping with his own loss and death, Irwin has most likely created characters, from ideas he gets from the objects that surround him at the orphanage, to console him as he is abandoned and his life nears its end. But then again, maybe he really is an angel, and he has found his kind and can now return home. I must emphasize that there are some truly beautiful moments in the film, heartbreaking, vivid and full of loneliness and sadness. Unfortunately, the film as a whole just ends up feeling disconnected and somehow incomplete.\",\n"," \"What a plot. What nice parents. What a quickie. Sex to die for. Hum! This film started off confusing enough. She felt she had killed her parents so she sees the ghosts of them. Would they have done this? The parents I mean. They loved their daughter and didn't blame her for anything. So her guilt was her own and she runs from the cemetery leaving her car behind. Sees her dead parents in the house and runs out of the house and into her car. Where did that come from? She drives from home miles and miles (how interesting-Not!) Then she picks up a stranger and chats and forgets to drop him off and gives him a hug. He was a Hitch-hiker when do hugs come into it. The then poor guy (Oh how things change) had to walk home after all. Oh and the rain that fell just in front of them without them getting wet (someone with a watering can in front of the camera?). So the story develops. This is deadsville with more corpses than you can poke a stick at. Someone said that they reminded them of the '70's but then for me the whole film did. Actually the film got a wee bit better and I did stay with it until the end. I guessed the dead bits (it wasn't hard) and I liked the idea of the sheriff being supportive (young though. And I like the idea of the drowned town and the death/hauntings. Look I was generous giving this 3 but it did have some endearing qualities. Naff lines like, killing people. Marvelous! The little girl was quite creepy on her own. And why do all dead children of the female persuasion look like her? I loved the dead getting up in the town hall. The deaths where interesting, but never really made clear. One more thing. When she drove away to go home the scene was exactly the same as the one when she was travelling in the opposite direction.

This movie was written directly for the screen by Neil Simon, and his mastery of creating a hilarious but also surreal story perfectly works in this uproarious comedy. The luggage sequence, being dumped down in the middle of the central park, breaking off the tooth scene, to name a few. Two main characters, namely George and Gwen Kellerman, are played best by always-wonderful Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis. This movie could have been just a stressful and noisy film without their lovable chemistry. I heard Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn are now remaking this movie, I don't know what kind of success the new version will get, but I am sure, by all means, they can't even get close to the quality of this original one(the original was in the early 70s, and its now 90s!!).

Vicky says yes, Sapna is confused, Prem adds to the confusion confounded until...And then how the sacrificial jigsaw puzzle is abruptly solved, forms the substance of this \\'savior de f aire \\'. Production values have substantial glitz and glamour. Technically apt. Cameraman Harmeet Singh seems to have been literally in a holidaying mood, so he has beautifully captured the new scenic locales of Cine Tirol region and Salisberg - Austria, where nothing else but only the songs have been canned. Editor A.Muthu has been hampered by the hackneyed story, screenplay, dialogues of Rumi Jaffery, Ikram Akhtar, Yunus Sajawal and even their constant take-off on senior actors like Dilip Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan was not in very good taste. Musically the Anand-Milind - Sameer combo leaves much to be desired, with only the title song sung by the principal actors,\\'Chori chori sapno mein aata hai koi\\' and \\'Meri neend jaane lagi hai\\' that are worth humming.<br /><br />Performancewise Sanjay Dutt excellent as usual and exudes a tremendous screen presence. Salman Khan too matches his senior co-star especially in the comic sequences. Karisma Kapoor successfully displays her comic forte, apart from portraying all the nuances of her well defined role. On the other hand Naghma, Sonali Bendre and Twinkle Khanna\\'s gutsy, guest appearances are just about okay.

However, I agree it might be difficult for other Spanish speaking people who are used to a more 'orthodox' Spanish to understand parts of the dialogs, which is a shame. Dialogues are what makes this film so interesting and touching. The things that are said contrast with the things that remained unsaid, and you can only imagine by reading the character's eyes. Alicia, for example, is almost always laughing and having fun, but her eyes are dark, worried. Her happiness is just a mask she wears to avoid realize how much she feels bad about what she is missing for, a real family, with children. She only tells Hache about that, she wishes she were his mother. Hache apparently is resigned to being a nuisance for his parents, but he wants to escape this situation by living alone, even though he's not ready yet. He uses drugs and only his father's best friend manages to keep him away from danger.<br /><br />The two main actors were great. Federico Luppi's portrayal of a father who is very disappointed for his son's way of life was so real I wanted to kick him! Juan Diego Botto was perfect, too.

Yes, there's mention of evil spirits and malignant forces, and even a word about the dreaded vorvolaka, an undead vampire-like creature that's part of Greek folklore. But even with a mysterious Madame Kyra (Helen Thimig) professing such belief, and others in the story buying into it, the production makes it pretty plain that the reason folks are in danger is because of a plague that has infected the island. The attempt to link Thea (Ellen Drew) to malevolent forces didn't really work for me, she was just too wholesome and good looking to imply a serious threat. That role should probably have gone to Madame Kyra, perfect for someone warning about vorvolakas to actually be possessed by one.<br /><br />What works best I guess is the way General Pherides (Karloff) slowly unravels from a man of strong principal and belief in science to a mad man intent on eliminating a superstition come to life. It's that psychological aspect to the drama that holds more water than the implied horror component, even if Mrs. St. Aubyn escapes from her coffin. Enough explanation revealed her bouts with cataleptic trances and fear of being buried alive to make that an expected part of the story, and one would presume that that was enough to put her over the edge with the old Poseidon sword.<br /><br />Nevertheless the film is enjoyable on a number of levels; for one, lovers of old films will delight in the great ambiance of an isolated, wind swept island and the dark, moody atmosphere of the Albrecht home. The characters never wear out their welcome, and as others on this board have suggested, those that might have make an early exit. Be prepared though for a Karloff you haven't seen before, all the while I just couldn't get used to seeing him in a military uniform with curly hair.\",\n"," \"(spoilers??)<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to think of the movie.

It is true that the film is just plain ugly to look at, and the over-acting is sometimes embarrassing. But perhaps the critics are being a bit unfair by measuring it next to films like \"American History X\" and \"Romper Stomper\". If you put it next to a highly-produced Hollywood film like A.H.X, then sure this one will look sick in comparison. Or if you put it next to a truly fantastic piece of cinema like \"Romper Stomper\", a film that actually played in art house cinemas around the world, it just isn\\'t fair. The only thing these films have in common is their subject matter: skinheads. Period. Pariah lacks the artistic merits of these \"legitimate\" films. But when looked at in the \"trash film\" context, then this one becomes at least entertaining. Perhaps watch this one in the same way that you would watch \"Toxic Avenger\", or \"Shaft\", or \"Class of 1984\" etc.. Of course the way they portray skinheads in this movie is nauseating, offensive, and highly inaccurate. But lets face it; there are so few films made about the punk and skinhead scene, that when something comes along, we just have to see it. Anyway, look at the way punks are portrayed in \"Class of 1984\". Murderous criminals! But like Pariah, that flick is good for a laugh. In short, look at this one while you\\'re hanging out and drinking with friends. You have to admit, this trash film does deliver the goods when it comes to violence. It is stomach-turning in some places. And if you want to see a good, thought-provoking film about skinheads, see \"Luna Park\", the one about the Russian skinheads. But don\\'t expect a lot of action there. By the way, remember \"Skinheads: Second Coming of Hate\" with Chuck Conners?? Now there is a classic. \"Pariah\" is almost good compared to that one! A.C.A.B.',\n"," 'This show is about putting a person into a job that she does not have the basic requisite skills to perform properly. In particular, Lauren Jones, a former Miss New York, is assigned to a job as an anchorman at a struggling Texas television station. She has no training with television or production equipment, or with doing news broadcasts.<br /><br />Such a concept may work in a scripted fiction show as there would typically be a reason why the person has to try to sustain the appearance of competence, and there would be humorous situations and dialog built in. However, it does not work with a reality show, as comments and situations as those that make the TV series \"The Office\" or the movie \"Anchorman\" amusing would (usually) never be made by real people in real jobs. The idiocy in Anchorwoman is incredibly predictable and not at all entertaining. We all deal with inept people at work, and it is frustrating, not funny. As an analog, how amusing would it be to watch someone technologically illiterate be put in the job of a network administrator where he had to call the boss to bail him out for even basic tasks?<br /><br />This is absolutely the worst show I ever saw. The genre was listed as comedy and reality. Comedy is supposed to be funny and reality is supposed to be riveting; this show was neither. Very quickly I didn\\'t find it entertaining (the initial allure of Lauren Jones\\' looks wore off rather fast), but since it was the premier episode I decided I would give it a chance and stick with the show for the entire half hour. Unfortunately, when 30 minutes was up, there were no final credits, and a quick info check on the TiVo revealed the show was actually a full hour. I rarely do this, but with Anchorwoman I decided I could not force myself to sit through another 30 minutes. I changed the channel and did not go back, and I never had any qualms about not finding out how the show ended.<br /><br />Fox made a very wise decision to limit its damage and not air a second episode.',\n"," 'Wow, what a fascinating movie and different kind of film. One really can\\'t get the full impact of this through a review. Anyone who has seen this, I think would agree with me on that.<br /><br />If I had skipped over the credits and someone had told me Terrence Malick (Days Of Heaven, The New World, The Thin Red Line and Badlands) and directed this film, I would have believed it. Visually, this is his kind of film. I wonder if this movie inspired parts of his latest effort, The New World? There are a number of similarities. Black Robe has the same kind of beautiful and haunting images Malick\\'s films possess but the director in this case is Bruce Bereford, the man who directed Driving Miss Daisy a couple of years before doing this film. DMD also is beautifully-filmed.<br /><br />Black Robe is not just a piece of art. As great as it is visually, this is a powerful story of a well-intentioned Jesuit priest in the early 17th century who travels to \"New France\" (upstate New York/French Canadian territory) attempting to convert a few area tribes to Christianity. To unbelievers, that seems pushy but Biblically-speaking it is not. Jesus commanded his followers to do just that (Matt. 28:18-20) , so the priest is only doing what missionaries have done for centuries. He also is a good man, stays strong in his beliefs regardless of his own well-being and is a gentle soul. Kudos to the filmmakers for being fair to him.<br /><br />The Algonquins and the Hurons are also shown with their beliefs, too, and their cultures which obviously were in contrast to the white European-based priest. All sides are shown fairly in this movie, with both positive and negative traits of all.<br /><br />I was shocked at a few scenes in here, not expecting them as the film has such a gentle flow to it before anything dramatic happens. We see a few sexual scenes and then some brutal violence. The Hurons, particularly, do not want any invasion of their privacy and culture and are openly hostile to the priest and the Algonquins. The story transforms from a quiet Malick-type \"New World\" poetic piece to a violent, suspenseful film and the question is, will the \"good guys\" make it out alive?<br /><br />The actors in here, perhaps, are not names most people outside Canada are familiar with, including me, but Lothaire Blueteau as Father Laforgue, Aden Young as his assistant \"Daniel\" and Sandrine Holt as Daniel\\'s Algonguin lover \"Anuuka\" are all very, very good. All the characters in this film are very credible people, steadfast in their own beliefs and they come across as realistic people. Most films have unreal people with unrealistic dialog....but not in this movie.<br /><br />Another big plus was the soundtrack: a lush, haunting score throughout.<br /><br />Without spoiling the ending, or adding political/theological agendas my own, let me just add that if you enjoy a beautiful-looking movie which also has a thoughtful, haunting story with honest characters, you should check this out. Highly recommended.',\n"," 'Not wishing to repeat what everyone else has noted, I will only say this: <br /><br />Nearly everybody says they loved Curly best... but I will put BRIDELESS GROOM up against ANY of other the Stooges shorts. <br /><br />I think it\\'s the most hilarious from start to finish, as well as being the most re-watchable.<br /><br />The off-key singing student...

Indeed, if the movie was a cup of coffee, it'd be rather weak and watery, littered with a few undesirable dregs and lacking in a lingering aftertaste. Sporadically it hits the spot, but otherwise it isn't the hot action-drama it hopes to be.<br /><br />Plot-wise, Coffy is a nurse who takes the law into her own hands and delivers hard justice to the drug-pushing, lady-pimpin', mob-suckers that hooked her younger sister into a depraved, sick state. Socio-political commentary on the plight of urban black youths in America is prominent in Coffy, and it makes for some thought-provoking stuff as Coffy crusades against the political corruption and white establishment racism that profits and acts as a parasite off the targeted Afro-American minorities. Sadly, the timely messages are undermined by the film's poor quality and lack of focus. Coffy's ideas are important, it's just that they are not well-aimed.<br /><br />One of the plus points of Coffy is the presence of Blaxploitation icon Pam Grier. Grier goes at her role with gusto and makes for an appealing action heroine as she shotguns down the scum in her often spectacular acts of vigilante violence (how do you deal with a house full of hoods? Drive the car right through the front door!). It's just a shame that the storyline wavers on occasions, wasting time squeezing as much sexual exploitation as possible. The low budget can't have helped, but neither does the fact that for a Blaxploitation flick, Coffy lacks groove. Just as the issues are undermined by the lack of quality, consequently the entertainment and excitement are also skewered by moments of dullness and misdirection.<br /><br />The total result is workmanlike and wooden. We get a hip heroine but not a hip movie. It's a shame as Coffy has its moments and should rightly be regarded as a key film in the Blaxploitation craze; it just never ascends above being an average, lukewarm number.\",\n"," \"I just rented Blackwater Valley Exorcism because the cover and pictures looked terrifying, and I don't normally watch movies that are automatically released onto DVD, but this looked so interesting and scary!

Just look at The Exorcist or The Exorcism of Emily Rose, both terrific movies that made break-throughs not only horror wise, but story as well.<br /><br />Blackwater Valley Exorcism is about a girl, Isabelle, who from the get go is automatically possessed, so we can't even tell what kind of a person she was to begin with. But a former wife beater turned priest is on the case with a gardener...? I know... I know. Then they go into several other stories with the priest and Isabella's sister, and the priest hit the sister and messed around with Isabelle?

One of them, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper, who looks like Clint Howard with an anorexic Matthew Lillard combined) is taken prisoner.<br /><br />(Spoilers)<br /><br />In captivity he plans revolution and thanks of the sheer stupidity of the Psychlos, the crappy script and a healthy diet of rats (don\\'t ask) he gets away with it, a final battle is set, primitives humans who knew nothing about technology learn how to fly combat jets in a few days in flight simulators with only repeating \"Piece of cake, piece of cake\" as a motto. Then is Psychlos v/s humans. Who will win?...<br /><br />(End Spoilers)<br /><br />According to John Travolta this is a movie he wanted to make for more than 20 years in honor of his dear mentor Mr. Hubbard. It seems that the wait was in vain. Apparently the filmmakers and producers were aiming high with this movie, they were dreaming another \"Star Wars\" trilogy in the making with thousand of millions wasted in merchandising, action figures and promotion, several spin off were planned before the premiere(including a sequel and even an animation series!) but after the box office and critical slaughter they wake up and realize they got \"Robot Monster\", \"Plan 9 of Outer Space\", \"Manos, The Hands of Fate\", \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\", \"Terror from the Year 5000\" and \"Mommie Dearest\" all rolled into one.<br /><br />This lifeless, cliche ridden waste of film is one of the worst movies ever made. No doubt about it. Everything that made the cinema art great is wrong in this one. Terrible script, inept direction, ugly photography and lighting, lame editing, overblown sound, obtrusive camera angles, run of the mill special effects and the acting MY GOD! the acting is incredible bad. The entire cast is making fool of themselves but it seems they thought they were doing Shakespeare in space. The urge of bursting into laughter after reading those lines must have being difficult to repress during the filming. And even under thousand of layers of bad make up you can still notice Travolta hysterical overacting (who takes his character waaaay too seriously, channeling Vincent Vega by the way of Danny Suko with a little bit of Tony Manero on crack) and Forest Whitaker face of complete embarrassment. I felt sorry for Barry Pepper who must have signed the dotted line thinking this part would be his big break. I hope his career recovers. And why is Richard Tyson doing the role of Tarzan in the future? Or is Deathstalker? Or Yor? My favorite is Kim Coates in the role of Carlo, world\\'s biggest wimp and useless sidekick who spent the entire movie cowering in fear, arm waving, over reacting, and eye popping in extreme his green eyes, you\\'ll swear he is Marty Feldman in disguise.<br /><br />See it to believe it.

It\\'s the best damn summer camp movie of all the summer camp movies. Does anyone quote \"Little Darlings\" line by line? Or \"Whitewater Summer\"?<br /><br />This is just one of those movies that got into my brain when I was in junior high, and stayed with me all these years. Every time I feel geeky, I mumble \"Spaz. Spaz. Spaz. Spaz.\" Or when we\\'re hiking in the brush in the forest, I tell my husband, \"I\\'m Wudy da Wabbit.\" (He doesn\\'t get it). \"It just doesn\\'t matter. It just doesn\\'t matter.\" I mean, this stuff is classic!<br /><br />Disappointed with the DVD, though. Wish there were special features, maybe a commentary or a making-of. But the movie itself is a perfect snapshot of life as an adolescent in the late \\'70s. Maybe not MY life...

To explain my experience, let me use this word picture: Imagine that you have been binging on pixie sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing but Twilight Zone reruns. The resulting coma lands you in a hospital, where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenalin into your IV. The dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie.<br /><br />SUMMARY: A man shows up at the door of a couple. He gives them a box with a button on it. Press the button, they will get a million dollars in cash and a person they don't know will die. I'll try not to spoil anything, but from there things devolve into a plot so intertwined and complex and purely original that it will make you question your sanity. But hey, most of us have been sane for a while now, and change is good.<br /><br />PROS: Amazing storyline, overall good acting, not a slow moment once it gets going. It asks questions of human morality that are rarely, if ever asked in popular culture. This movie is deep, it has meaning. Its not summer blockbuster special effects fluff (not that there's anything wrong with that); this movie had a relatively low budget and it showed in some places. But i think it is perhaps that very thing that makes me like it so much.<br /><br />CONS: The first twenty minutes, before it gets going, are really quite slow. At the end of the movie, you will be so confused that you just have to sit down and think for a good half hour. I can guarantee that this movie will not get rave reviews from your peers or most critics; it is far too strange and there aren't explosions every three seconds. In fact there are no explosions of any kind in this movie (besides your brain popping from trying to understand exactly what the heck just happened). Personally I don't think this is a bad thing, but many will.<br /><br />RATING: Easily a 9/10. I have never had an experience like watching this movie. The only reason I can't give it a 10/10 is that it is just too wrapped up in itself. There are several large things left unexplained at the end that are still bugging me as I sit here writing this. But overall, this is the best experience I have had in a movie theater in quite a long time. But be warned, you will not like this movie if you can't sit back, turn on your suspension of disbelief to about 150%, and prepare your brain to do some impressive acrobatics.<br /><br />Visit www.thestuffblag.com for more reviews\",\n"," '** Contains minor spoiler** <br /><br />Despite being a remake of the 1960s BBC series, this comes across as an uninspired cross between Contact and Species. It is filmed using the typical cheap BBC Sci-Fi manner i.e. dull, grey, overcast and in a quarry. They spend the budget on the one \"special effect\", which is, of course, destroyed at the end. The story is unconvincing and the basic science is badly flawed (real time communication to Andromeda anyone?)<br /><br />It tries to pad out a thin story line with the addition of a few extraneous few subplots, namely a love triangle, some espionage and the oh so stereotypical \"government subverting science for evil\" thing. Even Jane Asher can\\'t drag this up from being a long, slow, and predictable hour and a half.',\n"," 'Fifty years ago moviegoers found that Fox\\'s PRINCE VALIENT was much better than expected, thanks to Henry Hathaway\\'s fine direction and a wealth of good sense from 20th Century-Fox. Fox was still well-taken with their new CinemaScope process that just begged for action and beautiful, colorful settings. This movie excels at all, but it\\'s mostly the rock-solid story of King Arthur and the Vikings that makes it.<br /><br />Screen beauties Janet Leigh and Debra Paget almost never showed any leg in any movie, and herein (sorry) are fully covered as usual. Anyway, it\\'s the men who dominate this story. Robert Wagner is perfect as Valient, and Sterling Hayden is at the top of his form, as is James Mason.<br /><br />Truth is that in the age of comic book movies (2000-2008) Hollywood\\'s cocaine sniffers have no clue how to craft this genre with any classic quality. The secret is to focus on (1) story, (2) character development, (3) spectacular sets and scenery, (4) challenge, redemption, faith, patriotism. The religion and honor in Prince Valient would make today\\'s godless movie industry cringe.<br /><br />These days the focus (if any) would be on animation, choppy editing, almost no dialog, and the usual/identical musical score: vim, vim, vim, vim on a violin while a chorus belts out wordless chants. Boring! Thus films like Jerry Bruckheimer\\'s \"King Arthur\" -- to name just one, is no longer even a memory, let alone a classic.<br /><br />Treat yourself! Rent \"Prince Valient\" on DVD.',\n"," 'I watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was. I was looking forward to it after reading the plot (even though I find Nirvana overrated). It sounded like it would be tons of fun but it was more than that. Jansen puts in little touches like the books (Kubrick book among others), movie posters, etc. I like when I see a director takes his time and put his heart into a film. And you can really feel that in this. There are tons of scenes and moments that I love, I am trying to think now of some other films that are like this and I would say the only thing I can think of are Cameron Crowe films. Takes little moments and makes them stand out and special. The soundtrack is amazing and each song works perfectly with the scenes and feel of the film. This film is amazingly shot, and the editing is outstanding. I could really go on and on about the film. I cannot recommend this enough really. If you want a fun story with great tunes from a director who clearly put his heart into his work then check this out.',\n"," \"It's never a good sign when the DVD costs just £1 and comes in one of those very thin cases. Neither is it when there's just the bald title printed on the disc and there's no additional material. Still; we live in hope...<br /><br />Well; what you see is what you get. Don't be fooled by Roland Emerich's name amongst the credits; this is truly a C-movie.<br /><br />The plot goes something like this. Uninhabited worlds in deep space are being mined for minerals. The stuff is then taken away in shuttle-craft to planetary processing plants. This makes the shuttles extremely valuable and somebody is hijacking them. An undercover cop is sent to find out what's going on, by joining a prison-team at the next world most likely to be targeted. That's 'Moon 44'.<br /><br />Like so many of these cheap (and not so cheap) movies, money seems to have been saved by not employing a lighting facility. And everything happens in an often barely discernible gloom - even indoors. The twilight never lifts from the beginning to end, making for an extremely dull and claustrophobic experience. Actors are almost all B or C-list and they are doomed to struggle with a script that might be politely described as lacking intelligence. Even the 'big catch' of an ageing Malcolm Macdowell from 'A Clockwork Orange' fame, fails to illuminate either the set or the script.<br /><br />There's so many silly things going on as regards the plot that it sometimes appears as if children had drafted it. Macdowell's the boss/baddie on the moon, but we never know who he's working for. It's clearly not himself as there's a big battle-cruiser turns up to launch an attack on the moon. Where from? Who's in it? Where does it go? Who cares - clearly not Mr Emmerich. Criminals are sent as defence pilots. They fly helicopters along smoke-filled canyons. Why? why not gain altitude and be a helluva lot safer? Weapons systems are actually more primitive than those available today. Apaches (attack helicopters) employ 8 'Hellfire' guided missiles with a range of up to 5 miles. These defenders didn't engage the enemy within 1000 yards.<br /><br />On top of all this, there's a testosterone-sodden bi-line about these violent scum-of-the-earth criminals (who are yet still exceptional enough to be qualified helicopter pilots) that makes 'Shawshank' seem like a holiday-camp. This is needlessly emphasised by a shower-scene rape. Ironically, the rapist chooses to rape his land-based navigator, the one man upon whom he will have to depend in the foggy valleys, and it never occurs to him that this geezer might take revenge. Yes.<br /><br />Bought as a piece of cheap Friday-night throwaway hokum, it was in the charity shop by Saturday afternoon.\",\n"," 'Not only do the storylines in \"The Sopranos\" engage audiences from all over, but I think (for me at least) what brings the viewers back is the acting. (Not even you, Gary, can dispute that claim) James Gandolfini, who plays the lead-man, Tony Soprano, has become (in this viewer\\'s opinion) one of the \"Hollywood Elites\" as far as acting in a television series goes. I wouldn\\'t go ahead and compare him with Robert DeNiro or Al Pacino, or at least, not just yet. He, however, does do a hell of a job playing the part of Tony Soprano. In the years since 1999, Gandolfini has risen so much so as an actor (mainly thanks to his role in The Sopranos) that today he is considered to be among the best in the business. And it\\'s not just him. \"The Sopranos\" fields a great supporting cast including that of Lorraine Bracco, Edie Falco, Michael Imperioli, Dominic Chianese, and the late Nancy Marchand who played Tony\\'s dreadful mother. At this point in the show\\'s existence, it\\'s being considered a cult-classic and rightfully so. The first two seasons were extraordinary. Violent and quite gruesome in a pretty frequent manner, but without a doubt, extraordinarily done. The third season was great, but didn\\'t quite live up to the hype of seasons 1 and 2. Season 4, which wrapped up right before new-years, was the weakest season yet (or at least, in my opinion it was). Despite a dry-spell, I still found it (season 4 of \"The Sopranos\") to be more entertaining than most of its competition and that\\'s saying a lot because lately I\\'ve been noticing a trend in good new television shows. Examples of this: Six Feet Under, The Shield, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and OZ (which is not technically a new show but ended with an unforgettable final season this year). To get back to my point though, to consider a show better than all the competition during a particularly bad year, no less, is quite an accomplishment on the part of the writers. \"The Sopranos\" ranks above and beyond all other television shows in its era and its writers deserve a lot of credit. To close, I\\'d like to say, \"The Sopranos\" is the real deal folks. For the average mature viewer (17 and above) who enjoys drama and doesn\\'t mind a mixing of a little violence and profanity, you might want to check out \"The Sopranos\" if you get the chance. Trust me in that it will be well worth the time.',\n"," \"Saving Grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon,when you are looking for something different than the regular scripts and wants to have some fun.

The problem is that Grace, who imagined to have some money saved for her, discovers that she needs to pay all of her husband's pounds in debts to not lose all of her things, specially her house that she loves so much. She never worked before, and is in a tragic situation until Matthew,her gardener who is very found of smoking pot, decides to make a partnership with her in selling marijuana in large scale.\",\n"," '\"What Do You Say To A Naked Lady?\" is a fascinating look at the sexual-social attitude changes in the United States during the transitional late 1960s. Mr. Funt, the power behind the popular entertainment programs \"Candid Microphone\" and \"Candid Camera\", may not have meant it to be, but this film brilliantly documents the generation gap between the 1950s post-WW II parents/grandparents and their 1960s flower child progeny. <br /><br />Dated to the extreme, it is a film of its time. (When a woman tries to sleep with a gay men, he\\'s tells her he can\\'t because he\\'s \\'queer\\'. A white grandfather type tells of his opposition to his son marrying a Mexican girl.

So he set his sights on marijuana. He met and became friends with Charles Randolph Hearst (of Citizan Kane Fame) and they talked about their shared dislike of cannabis. Now during this time, there was a real movement to make paper out of hemp.

Or, at least, we\\'d HOPE they would! MY GOD, the BAD acting in this movie, plus the BAD writing, the BAD production values (can you believe one reviewer on this board said, \"top notch production values\"? Yeah, based on WHAT, \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\"?!), the BAD special effects (on a level with the 60\\'s TV series, \"Batman,\" actually!) and the BAD direction, had me CRINGING in my seat! I quite literally HAD to watch this turkey to its unlikely conclusion, JUST TO SEE HOW BAD IT COULD GET! The ABSOLUTE WORST \"acting\" was perpetrated by the pilot, and co-pilot, of the B-52 crew (Powers Boothe and Rebecca De Mornay); DO you think the writer of this schlock could\\'ve had them on the same page, for at least two minutes??? I mean, one minute he (Boothe) is at her throat, and the very next minute he wants to \"canoodle\" with her! He calls her the BEST co-pilot he\\'s EVER had, and a heartbeat later, he\\'s giving her cyanide, and ordering her OUT of the cockpit! He (Boothe) engages in fisticuffs with another crew member, and later, THAT crew member ejects himself from the aircraft! JEEZE, at least Slim Pickens DIDN\\'T have THESE kinds of problems in the FAR, FAR, FAR, FAR, FAR superior, \"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.\" In that classic, the B-52 commander (Pickens) ONLY had to contend with a malfunctioning A-bomb. Speaking of \"Dr. Strangelove,\" one of the crew members from that earlier movie returns in this one: James Earl Jones. Man, HIS character is SUPPOSED to be a SAC-trained professional? He waffled, so much, I wanted to call him \"Aunt Jemima!\" You want to take MY advice, and the advice of a few other sane, rational and intelligent posters on this thread? SKIP this crud, and watch the vastly superior \"Dr. Strangelove,\" and \"Fail-Safe.\" Even \"On The Beach,\" with Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner and Fred Astaire, for end-of-the-world scenarios. BOTTOM LINE: Even the spoof, \"Airplane,\" with Leslie Nielsen (!!!), made more sense than this bottom-feeder did.',\n"," \"Featuring a few of Hammer's all-stars, this highly effective slice of British horror revolves around a house and the fates of it's previous tenants, whose stories are all told to a Scotland yard detective, in search of a missing actor.<br /><br />Story number one, which is probably the least impressive of the four, deals with a writer and his wife who've just moved in the house and plan to stay just for a short time so that he may write one of his horror novels. He creates a demented character named Dominic, who's a very creepy looking strangler, and soon finds himself going mad as he starts to seeing this beastly looking man everywhere he goes. After his wife convinces him to seek psychiatric help, a sub-plot is introduced which frankly, didn't really work for me. I won't spoil it for you.<br /><br />The next story (the best in my opinion) stars the wonderful Peter Cushing as Philip Grayson, a man who's moved into the home for his retirement years and soon makes his way to a nearby wax museum(that deals in the macabre) where he's very startled to find a wax figure that looks exactly like a woman from his past. Soon thereafter, an old friend(who also has a history with this woman) is in town for business and drops by to see him. The two men are in for a rude awakening as they soon discover that there was more to this woman than meets the eye.<br /><br />Story three stars one of my very favorites...Christopher Lee, who plays John Reid. After moving into the home with his peculiar daughter Jane, the nanny that he hires becomes awfully suspicious as to the way Reid suppresses his daughter. Well come to find out...if she knew what Lee did, she would have certainly understood.<br /><br />The final story is a rather light-hearted vampire tale that stars John Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt. After buying a cloak from a mysterious merchant, actor Paul Henderson finds himself turning into the very creature that he's portrayed several times in his career.<br /><br />Overall, the pacing and direction were very good, as was the most of the performances. There were nice Gothic touches here and there and an effective score to complement the ambiance. This one's a keeper, and comes highly recommended.\",\n"," \"Man With the Gun is pretty much forgotten now, but caused a minor storm of media interest back in 1955 when Robert Mitchum turned down both Jett Rink in Giant (which had actually been written for him and which was subsequently substantially reworked) and Charles Laughton's intended version of The Naked and the Dead to make it instead. Despite some obvious production problems and some harsh lighting that occasionally renders both Mitch and Jan Sterling in unflattering tones, it's a terrific dark western that more than stands comparison with his earlier Blood on the Moon as his 'town tamer' sets to work on a town that never had the chance to grow up before getting run down by the local badmen before turning out to \\x96 possibly \\x96 be almost as bad as the men he dispatches. Certainly his way of dealing with news of a death in the family \\x96 burning a saloon to the ground and goading its manager into trying to kill him \\x96 doesn't inspire much confidence in his stability. As well as a good script and a surprisingly good supporting turn from the usually irritating but here well cast Henry Hull, it also boasts a strikingly good early Alex North score, which even includes an early workout for one of his tormented emotional cues that would later turn up in Spartacus.\",\n"," '10/10<br /><br />PLOT DISCUSSION<br /><br />This is one of the best movies ever made and I am not saying that because I am being fooled by the seemingly nonsensical presentation. Those who dislike the film because they don\\'t understand the story often criticize those who are praising the film by saying that they are assuming its genius because they don\\'t understand it. I don\\'t view this movie as very allegorical. To me, it is a story with a beginning, middle and end. People become confused by the film because they expect it to have a deep, philosophical meaning that they are to interpret from the allegedly meaningless scenes. I feel they fail to realize that the crypticness comes from a chopped-up and rearranged plot combined with a very long and rather explanatory fantasy sequence and not from a chaos of visual allegory. Because of the limitation of length, I will try to keep this short and to the point and touch on the major concepts.<br /><br />The general plot: Diane moves to L.A. after jitterbug contest to get into acting. At an audition, she meets Camilla with whom she falls in love. Diane becomes enraged with jealousy since Camilla sleeps with other men and women. Diane discovers the other man (the director) at a film shoot and discovers the other woman (a random blond) at the engagement party for Camilla and the director. Motivated by her rage and possessiveness, Diane hires a hit man to kill Camilla. After that is done, she is overcome by loneliness and slips into an unconscious fantasy world where she lives the life she wants to. Diane is then awakened. In her conscious state she is haunted by what she has done.<br /><br />The significance of the fantasy: The film starts out, after the credits, with a 1st person p.o.v. shot depicting somebody collapsing onto a bed and slipping into unconsciousness. This is where Diane\\'s fantasy starts. The accident is there as an excuse for her to \"bring back\" her dead girlfriend and justify the fantasy life. She depicts her girlfriend as meek and innocent because that is what she wished she was. In the meantime, she acts like everything is \"like in the movies\" because she has an escapist personality. She also, in a sense, kills herself off and assumes the identity of a waitress named Betty at a diner. The story revolving around the director is a direct result of her feeling that he was in someway victimized in reality just as she was and \"convinces\" herself that he was forced to choose Camilla. It was also an unconscious expression of the lack of control she felt during the party. Camilla Rhoades in the fantasy is actually the random blond from the engagement party. She hated her so much that she turned her into Camilla and made the ultimate antagonist. She then took the real Camilla and turned her into a perfect, submissive out-of-the-movies girlfriend and used Rita Hayworth as an inspiration. She also paints the hit man as a very clumsy and incapable person to further justify the survival of Camilla. Her fantasy world, unfortunately for her, was a search for Diane which ended up being herself and made the dreamworld die by taking her through a series of reminders of reality. The first reminder was Club Silencio which chanted that \"there is no band\" and the \"instruments\" you hear are not really there; this is a metaphor for the fantasy. She begins to shake violently because it shakes her perception of her surroundings. The other reminder is the blue box... Actually, the blue box is not the reminder itself (more of a Pandora\\'s Box, really), but the blue key that opens the box. The blue key reminds her of the actual death of Camilla because it is what the hit man said would show up when it was done. Along with having love, this entire creation of hers is an escape from reality by living in the idealized Hollywood that she expected to be part of when she arrived. <br /><br />This is a story showing the psychology of a very troubled woman who lost a dream. It is not series of random things specifically designed to disturb and it is not a cryptic philosophical message. It is an unfortunate chunk of the human condition that is presented beautifully.<br /><br />However, ultimately this is all my opinion. I may be way off. Or it may not be intended to mean any one thing. There are many who disagree with me. Great! Afterall, why does it have to mean anything? Why can\\'t it just be a statement in itself? What if coherent, sensible narratives are shackles for artistic expression? Peter Greenaway, for example, has spent many words eloquently supporting that idea by such statements as \"I would argue that if you want to write narratives, be an author, be a novelist, don\\'t be a film maker. Because I believe film making is so much more exciting in areas which aren\\'t primarily to do with narrative.\" And where is the written rule that everything must be immediately understandable with only one possible interpretation? There is no such rule because the clarity of the movie is unrelated to the art of it. \"I didn\\'t understand it!\" So...? \"Mulholland Dr.,\" story or not, affects the viewers, harasses them, drags them, awes them, lulls them. The way it lends itself to interpretation is amazing. It never gets old. It never loses its luster. Its visuals are always effective and beautiful. It is cinematic perfection no matter what.

For instance, the black guy doesn\\'t want to work with Treat Williams because he heard that Treat was a \\'fecal eater\\' (a fact that doesn\\'t exactly advance the plot) in prison. So for more minutes than we need, we see yelling and shouting about this.<br /><br />The job gets botched because...if it didn\\'t, there would be no movie. Walken tells Garcia that his crew will now be -- get this -- \"buckwheats.\" What are \\'buckwheats\\' you may ask? Good question. As narrator Jack Warden (who inexplicably spends the entire movie telling us poor viewers what\\'s going on from inside the malt shop Garcia is prone to visit)explains it, \\'buckwheats\\' means that you will die in a most painful way. Ooooh! The rest of the film deals with Garcia trying to get his brain-dead crew to leave town. He offers them plane tickets to exotic locations. No one accepts these tickets because...well, if they did, the filmmakers wouldn\\'t be able to show us the various ways these people get tortured and killed by assassain Steve (have they made a movie without me yet?)

You have seen his movies; they are a mix of cruelty that includes honesty and passion. Not honesty in Almodovar\\'s characters, but in the way they are written, showing a tough reality. About passion, well, it occupies a place in every person, but is not always shown; Almodóvar takes care of that.<br /><br />He introduces you to the characters in the story, then he starts to develop a plot that you\\'re going to see, even if it is predictable. Víctor (Liberto Rabal) has lost, or not, his virginity with one woman (older than him). He\\'s not an expert when it comes to casual sex, but she wants to see this woman again, and doesn\\'t understand why she acts like she didn\\'t care what happened. The thing is he doesn\\'t know she does it every week. Then we see David (Javier Bardem) and Sancho (José Sancho) working in their car. They are cops. David is honest and professional, Sancho is alcoholic and incontrollable; his wife, Clara (Ángela Molina), cheats him with another man. Sancho loves her, but beats her and keeps her locked in the house. The one who connects them all is Elena. Víctor fights with her, the police arrives, someone is shot and we see a frame that shows the movie some years later. <br /><br />The person who was shot is David, who walks (well, he doesn\\'t walk) in a wheel-chair. David saved Elena\\'s life; they\\'re married. Víctor is getting out of jail; he shot David. Sancho is in the same situation with his wife. Now Víctor is angry, and plans his revenge; eventually he meets Clara, and follows Elena, and everything is connected again, until the end. <br /><br />Javier Bardem is excellent as David. He can cry while he talks and convince you that he is suffering. He is the finest Spanish actor, and it was wonderful to see him fighting against his character\\'s decisions to do the things he has to. <br /><br />Francesca Neri didn\\'t seem Spanish while I was watching the film. She isn\\'t, but she has the looks of a \"femme fatally\", and that was perfect for her role, which connected everything and had the strongest lines. <br /><br />José Sancho gives a good support as Sancho, reaching the extremes with his face. His character is doomed, because what happens to him now is not going to stop, and the worst part is that he knows it. <br /><br />Ángela Molina doesn\\'t have the chance to shine, but still does a decent work, with what she has got. She can\\'t be having sex with one only man, and she shows it. <br /><br />Liberto Rabal doesn\\'t show much acting talent, he\\'s not the mos experienced in the cast, but somehow, when he talks, he seems not right, but perfect, for his role. Listen to him at the end and you\\'ll see. <br /><br />Almovodar is gifted and he proves it in each frame of this tale. You need to look at every part of the shot to see the details he is giving to the piece. Look at the sexual scenes; the balance he achieves: it\\'s not so strong, but not soft either. It\\'s subtle. His way of directing the actors is amazing. He writes the movie, and knows it more than anyone, so you know he is there to tell the cast what to do, and help them obtain their amazing performances. It\\'s a visual style with life of its own. <br /><br />I said it. There\\'s cruelty and honesty at the same time. There\\'s passion. There\\'s betrayal, lies, sex. You see it in the characters, in their words. When David arrives home and sees his wife Elena in bed, and starts to touch her; she doesn\\'t like it. \"What\\'s the matter?\", he asks. \"It hurts\", Elena answers. \"Why?\", he says. And with a face that involves everything I\\'m talking about, she looks at him: \"Because I\\'ve been having sex all night\"',\n"," \"This is the second Poirot I've put back in the box before finishing. The first was Sad Cypress, and the reason is the same. Both come across as overly melodramatic to me, with the romantic elements so pained that it seemed the character's heads would explode. I like my Poirot in a lighter mode, and these to episodes seem to be spoken in a different language from the rest I've seen. I can imagine people liking this sort of thing, but I find it out of character for the series.<br /><br />As with someone above, I was bothered by the cuts between segments. A scene ends outside, and you're suddenly in a room and different people are talking already. I understand television breaks, but a few seconds to get you into a new setting would be appreciated. I certainly don't notice it in most Poirots, but the last 2-3 I've seen have had the same problem.<br /><br />For all of you complaining about changes from the book - do you really want to know what happens next in every scene? How can you watch a mystery when there's no mystery? If I had read the books, I'd certainly want the dramatic version to have new elements to throw me off.\",\n"," 'I have to say, as a BSG fan I wasn\\'t exactly sure what I\\'d think of this show. I saw it on the big screen at the Arclight cinema tonight (as part of the Paley Center screenings), and the cast and film makers spoke after-wards. Ron Moore said they \\'wanted to make a clean break from Battlestar, and do something different, and that yes they would lose some fans but hopefully they\\'d gain others\". <br /><br />Even without their talk, I am now a fan of the new show. But here\\'s what I thought of the film.<br /><br />I loved it. It was really very good. I guess I\\'m a true sci-fi (or \\'syfy\\' - do I really have to type that?) geek, because I\\'d totally watch this as a series. It has a strong and rich story, and kept my interest. <br /><br />It starts with a small group of teenagers plotting something, which to me was the weakest part and a bit confusing. The actor playing \"Ben\" should have given us more of a glimpse into his intense beliefs. The actress playing \"Zoe\" seemed a little posy, but she was playing a teenager (and I\\'m sure I won\\'t be the only one who thought \"Zoe\" was a cylon at first, perils of being a BSG geek). If they\\'re hoping these will be the new Bamber/Helfer/Park, they may want to rethink it. Surprisingly, it was the adults that captured the audiences attention.<br /><br />Eric Stoltz gives a stellar performance as Daniel Greystone, a man so haunted by his family tragedy that he jumps at the first chance of getting out of his grief and doesn\\'t let go. He does a chilling and enthralling job of conveying his character\\'s sly knowledge of the inner world of computers and people, especially in a scene in which he spins a web for the young teenage friend of his daughters, traps her, then dismisses and releases her. No sign at all of the \\'serial killer\\' he played on Gray\\'s Anatomy, really impressive acting.<br /><br />Equally as strong though not in it nearly as much is Paula Malcomson as his wife Amanda Greystone. She is just as smart and well written and beautifully played as Stoltz\\'s part, and I completely believed that they are a couple, and a couple that have been together forever and have a strong relationship, something rarely seen these days. I look forward to seeing what happens with this family, and hope they give her as much to do as Roslin in BSG- she is strong and smart and when she lashes out at her kid, you cringe, it\\'s really great. Not to mention her eyes, which could hold magical powers, that\\'s how intense they are. The scene where she takes on the government agent- very short scene, but beautifully played- really gives you an idea of her power.<br /><br />The other part of the show that did not work 100% for me were the scenes with Esai Morales, and the mafia type clan of his. He does a good job overall, but I did not believe in this mobs power, nor intimidated by their threats. I found myself wishing that this whole story line was a bit more mysterious and hard to figure out; the way it is presented is almost an homage to the Godfather, they kind of hit you over the head with it a bit. But given time, I can see how this will develop into an interesting \\'Upstairs/downstairs\\' kind of thing, with the poor minorities (Morales et al) versus the rich folk who rule the planet (Stolz et al). And to be honest, I did enjoy it when he spoke to his son about the origin of their name- that was a very well played scene.<br /><br />Note to BSG fans, the boy playing \\'Willy Adama\\' doesn\\'t really look much like Olmos, but he\\'s just a kid. Whether or not he\\'ll be featured any more than he was in this film, who knows? I sure couldn\\'t tell. But it didn\\'t bother me, because he wasn\\'t as interesting as everything else going on around him.<br /><br />Polly Walker plays \\'Sister Clarice\\', and she\\'s chilling and odd in every scene she\\'s in. I\\'m not sure where she\\'ll go or who she\\'ll end up with, but I was very impressed with her acting. In this film she was sort of on the side, but obviously being set up to play a very important part later on. She was nothing like her character in \"Rome\", something I always find impressive in actors.<br /><br />One nice surprise- the music is actually better and less obvious than BSG, even though it\\'s the same guy doing it, Bear McCreary. It has a haunting and unusual approach that took me by surprise, I\\'d buy this score if I had the chance.<br /><br />As to the \\'panel discussion\\' after the show, it was hosted by Seth Green. Ron Moore was very smart and articulate, David Eick was cracking wise (much like his video diaries), Esai Morales told a long story about how he was cast, and Eric Stoltz was very funny and didn\\'t really answer the questions ( but I\\'ve always had a thing for him). Paula Malcomson was tough (she took Seth Green to task for mistakenly saying she was on \\'24\\'), and the girls who played Zooey and Lacey were both darling. Grace Park and Tricia Helfer were there as well, answering questions about how they did the scenes acting with themselves on BSG. Overall a very interesting and wonderful evening.<br /><br />I\\'m giving the show a 9 out of 10, and very much looking forward to watching it all unfold.<br /><br />NOTE: I just watched this a second time and really hope they explore what the HOLOBAND was originally made for. I have no idea what that may be, but it holds a great deal of fascination to me.',\n"," 'The views of Earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by NASA have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of Apollo 11, and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the day.<br /><br />This would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the \"whole Earth\" picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window.<br /><br />I am waiting for Bart Sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by NASA, though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map, and the ones in private hands would still be a problem.<br /><br />Ah, a response: \"Trying to discredit this movie by referring to NASA weather data I\\'d say is a charming, but weak and gullible argument. What about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie? A certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels. Do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here? :-) This movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by U.S. government that the moon-missions were a success, and that man now are true masters of the universe. Things are nearly never quite what they seem.. Just watch the movie, and I dear say you\\'ll see things a bit different than before.\"<br /><br />First off, weather data doesn\\'t come from NASA, it comes for met agencies around the world. Second, the weather data undermines a major claim in the film. Third, far from being \"packed with irrefutable evidence\", the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked. Sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film, so he edited it and added his own interpretation. Unfortunately for him, his source film is public domain, and the bits Sibrel edited out contradict his claims.',\n"," \"Given the opposite circumstance of 2009 where the reality is we do have a black president, this movie takes on quite a powerful historical significance. For entertainment value I found this movie to be both engaging and repugnant. I was quite taken back of course by the blatant racism of the time, but also found the music and dancing incredible. Also it is quite cool to see Sammy Davis Jr as such a very young child actor. He plays Rufus Jones, a young boy who is being consoled by his Mammy. He is told 'Why some day you could be President'. This was so ridiculous in 1933 that it was mocked and thought to be endearing, charming and funny. The bulk of the movie is a fantasy sequence of what the government would be like if it was run by a black man. They depict the seats of government as being like a revivalist Baptist church.<br /><br />The fact was when I stumbled onto this movie one day it drew me in. It is really well done and very entertaining. I believe if we can look beyond the racism we can see this movie for all it brings us. In fact to realize that it is not only not ridiculous to have a black president, but that it is normal, just makes this movie that much more relevant. It clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness.\",\n"," \"This is a terrible movie, terrible script, bad direction and nonsensical ending. Also, bad performances, except from Clancy Brown who is criminally underused here, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was purgatory--you do it to unload enough bad movie karma to actually see a good one further down the line.<br /><br />The movie presents a father and son who look like they couldn't every possibly have been related. The part of the male lead is not well written and seems uncharismatic in this role. You can see the plot points a mile away. The actions of the female lead and that of her brother, the cop, also make no sense. So, a major action on her part at the end of the movie makes no sense script-wise.\",\n"," 'This is one of the greatest love story movies I have ever seen. Yes, I can agree that some parts may seem dated, but this does not distract from the film. One should try to observe, criticize and enjoy any art form from the perspective of the time. Clearly by the \"Sex in the City\" standards, Charlie Chaplin was horribly boring. However, when judged from the prospective of 1925 America, he was fantastic. Likewise Sayonara is a breakthrough film in its look into a mixed-race love affair, American \"manifest destiny\" arrogance and prejudice, and the complexity of different cultures. It is a natural next step to such films as Gentleman\\'s Agreement. Its purpose, however, was not just social commentary, rather, it is entertaining and enjoyable, with innumerable lines that one just doesn\\'t forget.<br /><br />However, even when taken only as a love story, it is terrific. Although, some attack Brando\\'s accent, he is at his near best in nuance and characterization. Buttons and Umeki (who both won Oscars) and the rest of the supporting cast add much to the film.<br /><br />Taka, the real star, does a fabulous job making you feel the passion she has for Brando, while being torn by her sense of obligation and loyalty. Her speech when she first meets and speaks with Brando is a classic and something rarely if ever matched in cinema. The dialog between Taka and Brando in her dressing room in Tokyo at the film\\'s end is equally good. Of course, it doesn\\'t have the mouth-sucking, spit-swapping and worse, that exemplifies love in today\\'s movies, but that makes it all the better. It portrays true love and passion, and not just \"heat.\" If this movie doesn\\'t touch you, then you are just too young, too cynical or dead.',\n"," \"This movie is one of the best Robert De Niro films ever made. Its endlessly quotable and has enough comedy and action to keep everyone happy. Watch out for Dennis Farina as Jimmy Serrano. The funniest part he's played until Get Shorty's Ray Bones. The banter between Johnaton Mardukas and Jack Walsh is genius and watch for Joe Pantoliano playing basically the same part he would play later on in Bad Boys. I would recommend this to anyone with a decent taste in movies. 7.5 is an abomination for such an excellent film. Everybody needs to see it and then give it the rightful place it deserves 10/10. More laughs can be gotten from Yaphat Kotto's portrayal of Alonzo Mosely FBI. It has solid acting and a solid script. It is an absolute must see for fans of De Niro or films like Welcome to the Jungle or buddy comedies. It's a film that will never become dated or old. In fact am going to watch it again now\",\n"," 'The friends Donald made in Saludos Amigos send him several gifts for his birthday. Eventually he hooks up with Joe Carioca and Panchito and they sing the title song before the film turns into a song filled series of travel stops.<br /><br />Over the years I\\'ve watched this movie in pieces as the bits showed up on various Disney shows and compilation tapes but until recently I never watched the entire movie together. I had heard that it was quite good. Unfortunately who ever told me it was good never really watched it or hadn\\'t seen it in years.<br /><br />The problem for me is that after a good opening segment of cartoons about birds the film becomes a music and dance fest. Joe Carioca and we get a song on Baia. When Panchito shows up we get surreal animation and some musical travels through Mexico. Its nice but any hope of it being anything more than \"music video\" is washed quickly away. Perhaps its just a dislike for the images that have been married to some nice songs, but I really don\\'t like this movie.<br /><br />The mixture of live action and animation doesn\\'t really work. Disney had been doing that sort of thing for twenty years prior to the release of this film and I expected more. Mostly the problem is that once the animated characters leave the foreground they look like badly done rear screen projection with all the color washed out.<br /><br />If you must see this, rent it. Actually rent it for the first half, but be prepared to dislike the second.',\n"," 'An intriguing, compelling script on mental illness keeps the audience guessing, with \"Possessed\", starring Joan Crawford, Van Heflin, and Raymond Massey....not exactly a cast made up of sublimely beautiful people. :)<br /><br />I thought this film more realistic compared to \"The Snake Pit\" and other similar films exploring this topic, since the story builds so slowly here, and Joan\\'s character appears normal in the beginning. A brief love affair with Heflin\\'s character, who unceremoniously drops her when he gets bored with her, is the catalyst that puts her obsessive schizophrenia in gear. Back and forth she goes between reality and fantasy, until a crime of murder is committed and she becomes catatonic. <br /><br />Joan Crawford stated she had to work harder on this film than on any other, but with what we know about her personal life today, we really have to wonder if she DID have to work that hard at all. She did seem to me to be an obsessive, jealous personality in real life, so how was this part a big stretch for her? <br /><br />A word on Heflin. What a cad he played in this film; Joan\\'s character was almost justified in doing what she did to him, because it was obvious he was going to marry her step-daughter out of spite and greed. It doesn\\'t matter that Heflin wasn\\'t the best looking fellow in the world, but he played his part expertly here, and had some of the best lines in the picture.<br /><br />I am not a big fan of Joan Crawford, but found myself hooked watching this film after about 20 minutes. A multi-layered, memorable performance from the Queen of the Hangers.',\n"," 'What a great film! When ever I watch this movie, I sit with a big grin on my face. This was one of the first movies I saw at the cinema as a kid. This film didn\\'t win any Oscars, but if there had been a category for FUN it would have won hands down. I don\\'t thing this film was ever meant to be taken too seriously. Like many of Doug McClures movies, \"At The Earths Core\" and \"The land that time forgot\", made with a hint of tongue in cheek. Made before the onset of cgi effects, this film has an innocent, non-cynical feel. It has Monsters, the lost city of atlantis, guns, fight scenes and more monsters, what more can you ask for in a low budget sci-fi. Films like this are often belittled by people who cannot see beyond their De Niro\\'s and Oscar nominations. The quality of a film, at the end of the day, is about it\\'s entertainment value, hence 10 out of 10.',\n"," 'I may not be a critic, but here is what I think of this movie.

In the early 1930s, he was on top of the world after appearing in Dracula. Yet, again and again, he made lousy decisions regarding his career. Perhaps he had a bad agent, perhaps his drinking and drug use had a part in it or maybe he was just crazy. Regardless, he ruined his reputation by appearing in pretty much any film--ranging from excellent horror films (such as THE RAVEN) to big-budget flicks (like NINOTCHKA) to grade-Z flicks for the cheapest and shoddiest of studios. Interestingly enough, although he agreed to do this terrible film, he actually turned down the role that later went to Boris Karloff in FRANKENSTEIN! As for this movie, it is a very silly an horridly produced WWII propaganda film that featured a dumb plot and wretched editing. Lugosi spends much of the movie murdering saboteurs--not a bad thing at all. But at the end, we find out that he is himself a Nazi plastic surgeon and all the American-looking men he killed were actually Japanese!!!! The funniest part of this is during a flashback. You see Lugosi talking to a group of Japanese men before he changes them to American-like men. When the camera scans them, the men are clearly Asian. But, on all the other non-close-up shots, they are all VERY Western looking--many with bald heads!! They looked absolutely NOTHING like Japanese men. I suspect the plot must have undergone a re-write and this might account for the obvious mistake. Or, it could just be shoddy production values and editing. In fact, early in the film, they show a street scene in the city and all the cars (circa 1942) are old Model T Fords--obviously from stock footage!!! The bottom line is that the film is bad but also very dull. Unlike PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, it's hard to laugh at the ineptitude--just be put to sleep by it.\",\n"," 'I own a copy of this film and have always loved it. I comment here, however, because I saw the PBS presentation of a concert version of Sweeney Todd earlier this week. That production was put on by the San Francisco Opera and starred George Hearn and Patti LuPone. In the early \\'80s Hearn replaced Len Cariou as Sweeney (Cariou had won the Tony for his performance). I saw Hearn and Angela Lansbury (who also won the Tony for her performance as Mrs. Lovett) perform Sweeney on broadway. They must have made the film at about the time I saw the show. To this day, the most moving moment I can ever remember in the theatre occurred when Hearn sang \"These are my Friends.\" (\"These are my friends, see how they glisten.\" \"My arm is complete again!\") <br /><br />Hearn\\'s performance in the San Francisco Opera production convinced me that he has lost nothing in the nearly twenty years since I first saw him perform the piece on Broadway and later in the film. What a talent! He is sympathetic, funny, and scary -- all at once; and he can sing, boy can he sing. All of this reminded me of how terrific the film is. Highly recommended. Ten out of ten.',\n"," \"This film quite literally has every single action movie cliche and all of them work to its advantage.

And if you don't know who Danny Trejo is then you probably won't like this film.\",\n"," 'I didn\\'t like this Bill Murray vehicle when it was originally released in the 80s, so I tried watching it again to see if my distaste for this film was down to my movie-going tastes in the 80s or was it that \"Stripes\" is simply a bad movie. Well, the verdict is in and \"Stripes\" is a bad movie.<br /><br />Now, \"Stripes\" may have been innovative comedy in the early 80s, and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are Bill Murray fans, but its still a bad movie.<br /><br />Why is it bad? Mostly because \"Stripes\" is supposed to be a comedy but it\\'s just not that funny. There are some laughs, but they are few and far between. Most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting. This lack of comedy is especially noticeable if you\\'re used to more contemporary comedies such as \"Anchorman\" which strive for laughs in every part of the movie.<br /><br />\"Stripes\" further suffers from Bill Murray and Harold Ramis\\'s lack of acting ability. Bill Murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career, and Harold Ramis is playing Harold Ramis. These two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the movie.<br /><br />Lastly, most of the comedy that there is in \"Stripes\" revolves around Bill Murray\\'s self-centered, smart-alec man-child character so if you don\\'t find that character funny (like I didn\\'t) you\\'re not going to find most of what little comedy there is in \"Stripes\" funny either.<br /><br />\"Stripes\" is very much a movie of its era, it hasn\\'t aged well and is not worth watching. If you want to watch an early 80\\'s \"buddy\" comedy I would recommend \"Stir Crazy.\" Like \"Stripes\" the humor in \"Stir Crazy\" is not as fast-paced as in contemporary comedies, but unlike \"Stripes\" it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable.',\n"," \"We saw a screening of Arctic Tale (or Death of the Polar Bears) at the Lloyd Center Cinema 10 here in PDX. I guess it is the finished cut, although the guy asking if we liked it didn't seem to know or care.<br /><br />It seems as though it was shot in high-def and DV and maybe some VHS-C because there is zero consistency in the picture quality even within a given scene. This is no Blue Planet and it is now clear that National Geographic has been completely deposed by the BBC as the reigning champ of these kind of films.<br /><br />We are reminded by the filmmakers who are doubtlessly evolutionary scientists that a jellyfish hasn't changed form for some 650 million years. This little factoid fits nowhere in the narrative, it is simply plugged in among the drowning bears. The jellyfish is perfect and hasn't needed to evolve since the seas were first poured out, the hapless bears, however, have come to rely on the ice that us selfish humans are now using to chill our Budweiser. There is no doubt among any sentient beings that the earth is getting hotter--at the end of an ice age things tend to get a little toasty and barring any asteroid strikes it is likely that these warming trends will continue regardless of what mankind does to accelerate the process. It's going to get hotter and the polar bears will probably die when that happens.<br /><br />But if you're a pure Darwinian evolutionist--who cares about the damn bears? The bears are simply unfit to survive in a warming climate created by us not-so-benevolent primates at our own imperative. People came from apes and we scratched some bones against some rocks and after a few years viola--Chevrolet Suburban! The bears had better learn to swim or grow some gills--really fast. Tough luck bears! You're really cute in Arctic Tale, but frankly you've been known to eat people on occasion and your extinction, sad as it may be, will probably save a few wayward Eskimos.<br /><br />There are also some Walruses? Walrii??--that are also going to croak because I spent and extra two minutes in the shower this morning. I now feel really bad that I have a water heater. I guess like Gil says--all drains really do lead to the ocean. Forget my shower--the cooling system at San Onofre must really be screwing with the walruses. Needless to say, we're going to kill all the creatures that rely on it being really cold or they are going to have to move somewhere colder or something just has to give. I don't know what to do about the bears but if they really require it to be 50 below all the time, how do these ones at the Los Angeles Zoo even stand a chance? I mean it gets well into the 90's down there.<br /><br />I am really confused as to whether the kids finding out that everything is going to die is entertainment or info-tainment or guilt-trip-attainment. Your kids will cry when they find out the bears are going to die. Some bears die in the film and it is very, very sad--thankfully my youngest daughter and I were out taking a leak during the bear death sequence because it might have over-traumatized my little 4-year-old. I wasn't even sure whether or not to flush the toilet lest I kill yet another bear. I'm not sure how much bear death is on my hands..I do drive a Civic, but I also take long showers.

I wanted it to win but Father Ted won the vote. Maybe next time, Barbara who is played beautifully by Gwen Taylor from another British comedy, Screaming, and her husband is played by the veteran comedian Sam Kelly. Her sister is played by Sherry and the woman who plays her best friend are both Coronation Street veterans.

The movie flows very well and holds your interest throughout the 1 hour, 50 minutes duration of the film. The film quality is not of the highest Hollywood standards; however the original film was supposed to be made in the genre of a gritty punk-rock style. The documentary about the attempt to make the film and the subsequent betrayal of the film makers is very well detailed and easy to follow. The original film makers themselves become the main characters in the documentary version of the movie. The interviews of the film makers and the actors has been assembled in a highly entertaining story that illustrates the struggles involved in making the original film, the eventual failure of the original project and the phoenix-like rising from the ashes that evolved into this documentary film. In my mind the documentary (A Texas Tale of Treason) is a much more interesting and entertaining film than the original film (Waldos Hawiian Vacation) would have ever been.

It has elements which one rarely sees in a Sri Lankan film. The depiction of war is so imaginary, completely different from the actual reality in contemporary Sri Lanka. This is something which has angered many natives of Sri Lanka. They accused the filmmaker of supporting the enemies of the nation.

As in many horror movies, good and bad, this movie takes liberty with the legend. It not only attacks humans, but it eats their intestines and has a bulletproof, nearly indestructible constitution. So tell me, how can a hypodermic needle penetrate its skin when bullets can't? And why, when the marines figure out that armor-piercing bullets can hurt it, do they split up so the chupacabra can pick them off one by one? John Rhys-Davies gives a performance that rises above the bad movie, and Chelan Simmons and Dylan Neal deserve credit for their performances, too.

Menzel is one of those great Czech New Wave directors (along Milos Forman, who managed to get into the spotlight by moving to the USA) who established this very special Czech style of movie-making: sensitive while humorous, joyful while tragic, with very intimate and thought-provoking stories.

Don\\'t miss it.',\n"," \"I won't labour the details since I think most of the points I would make have already been made by others. The acting is pedestrian at best. The plot is as thin as clingfilm and is a rather poor homage to Hitchcock's Rear Window (Please note: regarded as something of a masterpiece by many).<br /><br />Rear window works because we see everything from the main character's (Jimmy Stewart) perspective, namely the wheelchair, in his bedroom. Everything the audience sees is from that vantage point. Jimmy Stewart's character is a helpless observer who plays no part in any activity outside his bedroom. This creates an atmosphere of claustrophobia and racks up the tension continuously. This reaches an unbearable point when he sees the murderer returning home to his apartment, which his girlfriend has just broken into, looking for evidence. This tension is created by the knowledge that Stewart is powerless to warn or help her.<br /><br />The same scene is recreated in Mimic: Sentinel but is completely flat and offers us absolutely no tension whatsoever. There are various other nods to Rear Window which immediately tells us that the writers didn't really have anything new or novel to say in this film. There are various plot elements that seem to do little other than fill in time (in a film which seems overly long at 78 minutes). For example when he attempts to report the danger to the police, his mother starts an intimate affair with the officer whom she had met briefly once before several years ago? Then there is the kooky, doped up sister, who walks around flapping her arms all the time. The main character is too active to be the impotent character Stewart plays but he's also too feeble to be a real hero character.<br /><br />Leaving the Rear Window connection, there's very little rhyme or reason to the rest of the plot. No explanation is provided for many plot elements and very little motivation is given to any of the characters. It's all just an excuse for some atmospheric shots of not very scary giant insects dragging people off into the dark and some occasional shots of blood splatter. No attempt if made to create a feeling of impending dread as any real person would have in such a situation. None of the characters are in any way sympathetic and it's hard to get worked up enough to care about the film when we don't care about any of the characters.<br /><br />We're left with a film which lacks the substance of Rear Window and which fails to provide any substance of it's own. I wouldn't bother spending money to rent it but if it's on TV and you're a completist who liked the other two Mimic films, then go ahead.\",\n"," \"Intimate KISSES and that's about it!<br /><br />This movie is a TOTAL waste of time.

As enjoyable as the set is over all, this decision was an unfortunate one, for ONE TOO MANY is a very poor film which almost discourages the viewer from watching further. Like any typical farce, this one involves deception inspired by greed, panic when plans go awry, and complications escalating to the point of absurdity, but unlike the good ones, ONE TOO MANY is incoherent, unfunny, and downright annoying. It\\'s hard to tell at this point whether the hopelessly confusing plot is the result of missing footage or inept film-making, but whatever the cause, by the halfway point even the most alert viewer has no idea what the character relationships are or what is happening, and by the end one no longer cares.<br /><br />The only point of interest here is seeing the 24 year-old \"Babe\" Hardy, who appears considerably heavier than he would a decade later when he teamed with Stan Laurel, but who is nonetheless full of youthful energy. In the opening scene, awakening with a hangover, Babe performs a highly athletic backward roll off a bed. Trust me, that\\'s as funny as this movie gets.

Stewart Granger is Sandy McKenzie, who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that the buffaloes will soon be gone and he becomes disgusted by the act of killing. Gilson is a natural killer who makes no distinction between animals or human beings. Debra Paget as the Indian girl is a surprising character considering the self imposed censorship of that time. She lies with Gilson in total resignation even though she hates him. The last scene of a frozen Gilson, is unforgettable.',\n"," 'This was a rather cute film...a little slow at first, but quite amusing as it went along.

It has a great storyline, interesting characters, and some very good acting, especially from Rosalba Neri. Her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic. She steals every scene she is in, and expresses so much with her face and eyes, even when she's not speaking. Her performance is very believable. She manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top (not that there's anything wrong with being over the top). Mark Damon is surprisingly good in this movie too.<br /><br />The music score is excellent, and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie, whether you want it to or not. There are a couple of parts that are very amusing. I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri undresses in front of the parrot. There's also lots of slick gun-play that's very well done.<br /><br />I would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn't for two things. The first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minutes into the film. This is one of the most ridiculous looking fights I have ever seen in a movie. It is very poorly choreographed, and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight. One might be able to overlook this if it were a Terence Hill/Bud Spencer comedy, but this is a more serious western, and the brawl really needed to be more realistic. The other thing that annoyed me about this movie was Yuma's cowardly Mexican sidekick. I guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something, but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and he wasn't at all funny. All I can say is where is Tuco when you need him? <br /><br />All that having been said, let me assure everyone reading this that Johnny Yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults I have mentioned, and all fans of the genre need to see this movie.\",\n"," 'I love the munna bhai MBBS but \"Lagge raho...\" SUX really SUX.

When Charlie finds out David was a deserter in the Vietnam War. Hate builds up within, as he lost his son in Vietnam and he takes it upon himself to hand out the punishment for fleeing his commitments. <br /><br />If there\\'s a sorely under-valued and truly forgotten pearler, \"Wolf Lake\" is one of those sleepers that should have a wider audience. It might be far from perfect, as the project has some teetering problems, but for most part it\\'s an adeptly crafted and hauntingly cerebral picture. The problem area mostly arose from the oddly placed flash forward sequences that cut in and out within the narrative. This aspect certainly spoiled what\\'s about to come and clouded the story with confusion. Feels like we the viewer are missing out on details. Actually it begins with the ending, so it\\'s not terribly surprising in the final outcome. But reading a fellow user\\'s review on the flick, it has made interested in seeing the supposed re-edited \"The Honor Guard\". As the choppy editing that was worked in was the only thing that dampened the film\\'s edge. <br /><br />Despite knowing what was going to happen, Burt Kennedy\\'s sedately crisp direction was a ticking time bomb waiting to explode with the burning tension and scathing actions coming to the forefront in the closing half. Building up to this riveting game of cat and mouse was made possible by a studiously pressure filled script and a sensationally barnstorming lead turn by Rod Steiger. He really does get into his relentlessly, hot-headed character, but its hard to really despise him as the torment really shows in his face and we watch as it tears him apart. Whenever he and David Huffman\\'s character (David) share the screen watch how intensely gripping their confrontations become and how they feed the film\\'s fire. It\\'s a conflict of two generations just waiting to crack over their opinions of the changing face of America. The bleakly threatening atmosphere spun out from the beautiful lakeside backdrop and isolated woodlands was made to great use and a stirring music score truly does hold a lethal sting in its rhythm. All the rich performances are well grounded and focused. David Huffman as the placid-minded young man David is convincing and a lovely Robin Mattson plays hapless Linda. Jerry Hardin superbly plays the concerned and always consciousness Wilbur. His character is the little voice that Charlie would here if something he was doing didn\\'t sit to well. Richard Herd and Paul Mantee do well in their parts. If your expecting a rough revenge / survival exploitation vehicle amongst a familiar setting. Its starts off with a lot innuendo and then some disturbing moments (like rape) show up. There\\'s way more too it and gladly so. Kennedy fleshes out the situation with a diverse range of traits fusing together with excellent suspense and convicted performances. <br /><br />A couple hiccups can\\'t stop this stimulating potboiler from deserving to be picked out of obscurity. Admirers of Steiger or Kennedy shouldn\\'t miss out on this one. Recommended.',\n"," \"This movie is one of the poorest adaptations of a fabulous book that I've seen. Jean George's novel is a fantastic book that I think is an outstanding read for any child.

Although I appreciate a beautiful body, the contrast between the actors felt more exploitative than honest. A \"truer\" actress playing Ana (that is, not quite so fetching and physically perfect) would have made it less annoying. As for the sex, it was not as awful as some made it out to be - or perhaps reading the comments before watching made me expect much worse (that and I\\'m not fat phobic). Some scenes struck me as just right and way over done at the same time (the onanistic football watching scene is a perfect example, too much but there was something about it that I just loved).<br /><br />The comments here by Spanish speakers that the acting was just atrocious made me realize how much can be forgiven when you don\\'t speak the language of the film, but even I cringed at some of the performances. The scene in the countryside between Marcos and his wife for example. Ouch.<br /><br />During one scene we watch Marcos walking, walking, walking through the countryside, with that dead look on his face. It would have been excruciatingly dull to watch but the landscape was breathtaking. Like I said in the beginning, the photography saved this film for me. Mexico City looks amazing in this film - I feel as though I have really *seen* the city in a way I never have previously. And the sound (so heavy on the ambient) was enjoyable as well.<br /><br />On a philosophical note, I tire of the notion that women\\'s bodies are for wide consumption, and of seeing violence against women as portrayed in many films (as routine), but even with those predispositions, I could enjoy the film - well, aspects of it.

A girl who is always running seeking but never seems to find.',\n"," 'This film definitely had a great premise to work with, but it tried too hard to please the curious minds of its intended audience. Younger\\'s idea of exploring a relationship of an older woman with a younger man was definitely refreshing (well, aside from _Harold and Maude_) and his choice of having the story unfold in New York only made it more interesting. With the artsy profession of Rafi and the perpetual conflicts surrounding Dave\\'s Jewish background, these topics could only be properly explored with a diverse and cosmopolitan setting like New York. The film definitely allows the audience to explore different parts of city life and integrates the city mindset into its storyline, which being a city mouse, I definitely appreciated. My favorite example would be when Rafi points out that when one lives in Manhattan, a few hundred square feet of one\\'s apartment is all one has.<br /><br />Although this film is promoted for its sophisticated storyline, Meryl Streep adds the only charisma and sophistication to the entire film. Streep definitely outshines Uma Thurman and Bryan Greenberg in this film. In fact, she is the only person carrying it. Her acting is superb as always, and she delivers her lines with impeccable timing and emotion. Thurman and Greenberg, on the other hand, appear like two awkward teenagers throughout the film. They had zero chemistry, and Greenberg\\'s acting fed nothing to Thurman for her to work off of. Greenburg, despite his dashing, cute puppy looks, could not carry the leading man role because he seemed afraid to take the reigns. His lines would be delivered the way high school theater rehearsal lines were delivered -- nearly emotionless and confused in intonation. But Thurman wasn\\'t better off anyway; it seemed like she was trying to take hold of her role throughout the entire film but she just couldn\\'t get it right for some reason. Maybe the concept of the film was just too hard for her to work with, or maybe the script itself just gave her very little to begin with. Nonetheless, Rafi and Dave\\'s dialog is trite, cliché, and very middle school at times. Everything they said to each other seemed expected of them and didn\\'t add any new insights to their intellect, emotional maturity, or the maturity of the relationship. You could never really understand why the two were together besides the excitement from the age difference and the sexual exploration. Their romance unfolds in the most obvious and least charming fashion. (i.e. From awkward glances at each other while waiting in line for movie tickets with their respective dates to a \"nervewrecking\" scene of Dave struggling to call Rafi after looking her up in the phone book.) The dates they go on seem unrealistic for a 37-year-old divorcée. (i.e. Underground rap clubs.) All of the romance that is supposed to touch you and bring you closer to the characters really just pushes you away because the scenes presented are so hard to swallow.<br /><br />And you can\\'t help but notice that their relationship is based on a large part on sex, which doesn\\'t add any dimension to the characters or the story. Perhaps this is why it is so hard to swallow anything when either Rafi and Dave claim that they love each other. Because you can\\'t help but think that they\\'re merely infatuated with each other and this new experience and that it\\'s not really love at all. Despite the fact that Rafi insists to her therapist/Dave\\'s mom that she is serious about this relationship, it is hard to believe because you see nothing that Rafi and Dave have in common besides art and even that link is iffy and seems tacked on just to draw some connection between them. Younger never gives the characters real dimension or qualities that would make the audience draw towards them, so when the film ends, you don\\'t feel the connection with the characters that is needed for the ending to be felt the way Younger wants it to be felt. In other words, as you walk out of the theatre, you don\\'t really care about Rafi and Dave just like the way you don\\'t really care about two card-board cut outs.<br /><br />Younger seems to focus too much on the topics that come to people easily when thinking about relationships with such a great age difference, such as one person who wants a baby while the other person wants the newest X-Box game, etc.. The most cliché topics are touched on throughout the film, like being carded when buying liquor, playing video games instead of having sex, or being old enough to be his mother. If you add these topics and a few Jewish jokes here and there, you\\'ve got yourself _Prime_ wrapped neatly in a box. Despite the film having its fair share of funny moments and tasteful humor, Younger definitely could have explored this relationship on a deeper level and gave Thurman and Greenberg a little more to work with in terms of character development and dialogue. The failure to do this ultimately spoiled a perfectly good premise for a film. Maybe better luck next time. And hopefully the next role Uma picks will have a little more spice to it as it is always pleasant to see her on-screen, and she usually has better judgment.',\n"," \"Demonic Toys starts with two undercover cops Judith Gray (Tracy Scoggins) & Matt Cable (Jeff Weston) going undercover to arrest a couple of arms dealers Lincoln (Michael Russo) & Hesse (Barry Lynch). They meet in an isolated parking lot where things get out of hand & Lincoln shoots Matt dead, Matt also happens to be Judith's lover so she has extra incentive to take both of them in. Judith manages to wound Hesse who along with Lincoln break into a nearby warehouse belonging to 'ARCADIA TOYS' where Judith follows them. Judith detains Lincoln but they are both locked in a store room with a steel door while elsewhere Hesse crawls across a strange glowing spot on the floor badly injured & bleeding, as his blood drips onto the floor an evil demon is given the power to bring some of the various toys to life & Hesse first has his face chewed off by a mutant Jack in the Box, he then has his fingers bitten off by an incredibly vicious teddy bear & finally Hesse is shot by a toy robot using blue laser beams. Mark Wayne (Bently Mitchum) an employee of 'Chunky Chicken' fast food restaurant turns up to deliver an order to the grossly overweight foul-mouthed security guard named Charnetski (Peter Schrum), they both hear noises coming from the store room & discover Judith. Charnetski tries to go for help but is killed by the demonic toys, everyone, along with a homeless kid named Anne (Ellen Dunning) find themselves trapped in the warehouse & that these toys are controlled by a demon who grows stronger with each of their death's, stronger to achieve his ultimate hideous aim...<br /><br />Directed by Peter Manoogian for the 'killer toy' specialist's Full Moon Demonic Toys doesn't rank particularly high in this horror film sub-genre as far as I'm concerned. The script by David S. Goyer who has since gone on to write massive Hollywood films such as Blade (1998), Blade II (2002), Blade: Trinity (2004), Dark City (1998), Batman Begins (2005) & the upcoming Ghost Rider (2006) film was amongst his first & after this it's a wonder he was ever let near any of those films. The characters are extremely one dimensional, they have virtually no personality or background although having said that a one or two of them were sort of likable. Demonic Toys is about a demon trying to resurrect itself more than killer toys, this demon just uses them every once in a while to knock off one of the cast members. No explanation is given as to who this demon is or where he came from & Goyer also throws in some of those annoying dream sequences & the demon taking the form of dead characters trying to trick those still alive, you know the sort of thing. I would also like to know how that killer teddy bear managed to grow to human sized proportions. Demonic Toys is clichéd & starts to become dull as it's easy to tell who's going to die & survive & it features no logic or sense whatsoever. Technically Demonic Toys is cheap & nasty, the production design consists of placing lots of cardboard boxes with 'ARCADIA TOYS' written on them in each location & it becomes monotonous very quickly. There are various mistakes & errors & the special effects are generally poor except a rather good stop-motion animated toy soldier at the end. The music by Richard Band sounds like, but not as good, the theme from the far superior Dolls (1987) which isn't a surprise as Band also scored that. The killer toys themselves lack imagination except the Jack in the box who is the first toy to be killed anyway so don't expect to see a lot of him. The gore is tame & unconvincing apart from a reasonable decapitation, there are a few bites, a few gunshot wounds, a scene when someone pokes his own eyes out, someone is poked in the eye & someone has their fingers bitten off. The acting is OK for this sort of thing & both Scoggins & the goofy Mitchum make for pleasantly likable leads. Overall the best thing thing I can about Demonic Toys is that I thought it passed 80 odd minutes without to much pain but there isn't a whole lot here that impressed me & I'll have probably forgotten about it by next week (or at least I hope I will have). If your after a good, fun & entertaining killer toy film then check out the Puppet Master (1989 - 2003) & it's sequels, Dolls or the Child's Play (1988 - 2004) films instead. Great title, below average film but still maybe worth a watch if your absolutely desperate or a killer toy film fan.\",\n"," \"Sometimes it's hard to be a pirate...............but by golly Miss Jean Peters has a lot of fun trying - and it shows,particularly during her first spot of friendly swordplay with Blackbeard (Mr Thomas Gomez - eminently hissable)when the sheer joy of performing is plain on her face. With fifty years of hindsight Feminists seem intent on grabbing this movie as some sort of an anthem for the empowerment of women in a male - dominated society but I have serious doubts that either M.Tourneur or Miss Peters had any such concept in their heads at the time. It was an exciting,entertaining family film with absolutely no pretensions,hidden meanings or alternative agenda.It was fun. M.Louis Jourdan is both winsome and treacherous as her love interest.

That is the core question behind this highly original and masterfully crafted examination of the illusionary nature of reality. Blending Eastern and Buddhist philosophies with the visual chicanery of M.C. Escher, this fascinating treatise manages to take on the rather cerebral question of `Who are we and what is our place in the universe?', and turn it into a captivating and fun-filled 100 minutes. The film centers on Bart, a writer struggling with his screenplay, `The Sea That Thinks.' As he sits at his computer, the work begins to unfold as nothing more than a description of his sitting at the computer, writing the screenplay. Before long he is stuck in a whirling conundrum in which everything he writes becomes reality. Director Gert de Graaff approaches his subject with an impish sense of humor and dazzles the viewer with a series of astounding visual tricks that confront the nature and validity of our perception. Ultimately, de Graaff's film challenges the audience at several levels to question whether anything we see or touch or taste is really what it appears to be, or whether our entire understanding of the universe and our place in it is merely a trick played on us by our senses.

But as I was watching it, I thought about something. Some of the events that occur in this film are unbelievable. So really, the film is kind of a big fat lie. There is no way that he could've gotten away with all of this. Here are all of the unbelievable stuff.<br /><br />1. When he fakes his father had choked on a meatball, and acts like he is the father.

I wanted to see if I could figure out why he did the things that he did and why in the world anyone would follow him.<br /><br />This documentary begins with a very creepy voiced narrator telling you that basically this is Charlie\\'s turn to explain things. All the songs in the film are very satanic. The whole thing has a very dark feel about it.<br /><br />Charlie spends a lot of time preaching or teaching as he would call it. He compares himself with Richard Nixon and discusses how \"everyone has Lucifer inside of them\". The man really seems a mix of possessed and crazy to me. I did not really gain any understanding of why he did things that he did. I just got further proof that this person is exceptionally disturbed, not gifted as he thinks and as the film tries to persuade you.<br /><br />The film takes you to the famous Spaun ranch and shows pictures of then and now. Charlie tells stories of the ranch and explains how his \"world\" is still there. He goes on and on about how he does not live in our world, he is above and beyond us. Our world and the United States is the devil, an evil machine.<br /><br />I have watched a lot of documentaries about killers and criminals, trying to figure out why someone would do the things that they do, how they must reason it in their mind. This is unlike anything I have ever seen. At times, it is very boring, at times unbelievable. I got a very creepy feeling while watching it and confess, I did not finish the whole film. I lost interest in listening to Charlie rant and rave, he is clearly insane.<br /><br />All in all, you get a feeling of perhaps what his followers heard and saw from him.

I agree with the previous comments from other views that this is the only movie that I have seen that has brought the war home and showed what a family had to go through, what a veteran went through. It is almost heart breaking to think that back then people just thought you could come home from a life changing experience and be the same person you were before you left. Kathy Bates reminded me of my mother in a way. I believe she really showed how women felt and acted back then.

Yes, there are vampire stereotypes. Yes, there are scientific stereotypes covered here. Even martial arts stereotypes. All well and good, and sure, not all perfectly done. However, I sense one crucial point about this film is being overlooked...the cultural significance of its location. The film is set in Pensacola, Florida, and does not try to avoid saying so. That's a bold move in the film world today, and a rare treat for fans of indy films. And indeed, it may not be the last. Pensacola is world renowned as a Navy town, an aviation town, a lumber town, and sometimes even as a hotbed for political controversy. Rarely is it seen as a growing film town. But that's all changing now. More film companies are coming in to shoot. And more native Pensacolians are discovering the power of cinema for themselves. This film is part of a growing trend of Pensacola-based indy films, and more are on the way. Pensacola is making a big noise in the global film community, and by and by, the world is taking more notice. Watch and listen, world. The Pensacolians are coming.

The story cuts between past events, and the present day, when the aged veterans plan a reunion. This is a much publicised and controversial miniseries, here in Australia. The budget ran over ($6.5 million Aust. dollars); historians and veterans criticised it\\'s authenticity; and critics pilloried the uneasy mix of comedy and drama (shades of \"Pearl Harbor\"). Series writer John Doyle (half of the successful Roy & H.G. comedy team), has tried to defend himself with comments about \"the characters are composites of actual people\"; \"the troops used comedy to cope with the situation\"; \"it\\'s only based on actual events\"; \"one of our actors was actually there\" etc. I don\\'t have a problem with any of these points. Many superb fictional and factual dramas have come out of the Japanese P.O.W. camp experience: \"King Rat\", \"Tenko\", \"Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence\", \"Bridge on the River Kwai\", \"Paradise Road\", \"Empire of the Sun\", \"Blood Oath\", and \"A Town Like Alice\". Black comedy has often been used successfully in P.O.W dramas: \"Life is Beautiful\", \"The Great Escape\", \"Seven Beauties\", \"Stalag 17\", \"The Colditz Story\", and even \"Hogan\\'s Heroes\". So why is \"Changi\" a monumental failure? - the acting in \"Changi\" is uniformly excellent, the music and cinematography is good - it is the writing and direction that have let it down. Every scene seemed to give me waves of deja vu. When Anthony Hayes is made to stand in the blazing sun, I thought \"Didn\\'t I see Alec Guinness do this in \"Bridge on the River Kwai\"?\". The sudden flashes into surreal song & dance brought back Dennis Potter\\'s \"Singing Detective\", but without the finesse. This borrowing happened so often, it smacked of lazy writing by cut and paste, rather than homage. The constant intercutting between the past and present stories left me unable to concentrate on either. Flash forward and flash back can be a useful tool - here it left me distanced from characters, where intensity was called for. The \"Ausiness\" is overdone - every conversation seemed to include \"stone the bloody crows\" & such, that I was saying \"I get the point, I know they\\'re Aussies\". Cultural stereotyping extended to the British and Japanese too -sadistic young Japanese officer; uptight British officer; wiser Japanese commandant; fun-loving, rascally Aussies etc. I thought I was watching \"Hogan\\'s Heroes on the River Kwai\". After 3 episodes I\\'m tuning out.',\n"," 'Even without speaking a word, Billy Connely is wonderful as a zombie... Carrie Ann Moss as \"Mom\"?, even better.

If you are a fan of the French movies Taxi, Taxi 2 and Taxi 3, than this is definitely another movie that you should see.<br /><br />In this movie we follow Bennie, a fat, women hating snack bar owner who has been in jail for a failed robbery on a jeweler\\'s shop. When he gets out of jail he finds out that his foster father Mast is dying and that there are only two options to save him. One is the liver of a person with the same blood type or even better a relative, the other option is an operation in Bolivia, but that will cost an enormous amount of money.<br /><br />Mast tells Bennie that he has a son of his own called Koen, who has to spend his time in a Belgian jail. It is his last wish to see him once again before dying. This gives Bennie an idea. He\\'ll get his half brother out of jail, kill him and bring his liver to the hospital so his foster dad can be helped with it. But when the time has come to kill Koen, Bennie can\\'t do it anymore, because he started to like Koen too much. So now they have only one option: commit some crimes to raise money and save for the trip to South America.<br /><br />The acting is OK. The Belgian as well as the Dutch actors all did a very good job, even though I never expected to see some of them in this kind of movie (for instance Kurt Rogiers an Peter Van den Begin). The story is nice, although it sometimes fails a bit when it wants to offer \"too much story\". This kind of movies doesn\\'t need as much story as it needs action and jokes and that\\'s where it sometimes went a bit wrong. And you better don\\'t expect to see the most original movie either, because than this will be one big disappointment. This movie has been made with only one intention and that is to make as much fun as possible and to keep the audience laughing at regular times. And that\\'s exactly where this movie has succeeded. It does make you laugh, especially during the car chase (In my opinion that\\'s one of the most hilarious scenes in the movie).

However, the rest of the film clearly seems to emphasize that Chupacabras are a typically Puerto Rican phenomenon, so I don\\'t really know where that fits in. Are they saying all Puerto Ricans are aliens? Whatever, it\\'s all pretty irrelevant anyway. The only thing you need to memorize is that \"El Chupacabre\" is an utterly cheap and imbecilic amateur B-movie, lacking tension, character development and any form of style. Several duos of people are chasing this goat-munching monster (remotely resembling the midget version of the Pumpkinhead demon) through the streets and ghettos of an ugly city. We have an untalented dogcatcher and a nagging female novelist, a pair of obnoxious cops and the supposedly evil scientist with his dim-witted accomplice. Since they all are extremely incompetent in what they do, the monster can carelessly carry on devouring all the Latino immigrants of the neighborhood. The monster itself looks okay and the make-up effects on his victims\\' leftovers are acceptably gross and bloody. The acting performances are irredeemably awful and headache inducing.

For Satan. Probably more than in any other film I\\'ve seen short of hardcore porn. And every time they do, you\\'ll probably want to shout out, \"Nude for Satan!\" \\'Cause it\\'s just that much fun to say. Try it, you\\'ll like it. \"Nude for Satan. Nuuuuuude for Satan. I\\'m nude for Satan!\" See? <br /><br />Of course, there\\'s a bit more to it than that; there is a plot, kinda. Our Hero, Dr. William Benson, happens upon an unconscious woman who crashed her car on a lonely highway in the middle of the night. Seeking medical attention for her, he is directed by a very odd man to an isolated castle, and from that point on, things start to get very strange. The two get separated, and William ends up getting distracted by Evelyn, a dead ringer for the car-crash woman who dresses in period clothing (when she\\'s not nude for Satan), calls him Peter, and is hot for his bod. The crash victim, whose name is Susan, ends up spending time with a variety of people including their enigmatic host, an unnamed female servant, the leering, gap-toothed butler (or should I say, handyman?), and William\\'s doppleganger, Peter.<br /><br />Both William and Susan are fairly creeped out by the goings-on in the castle, but don\\'t really start trying to figure things out or get away until they meet back up when Susan is menaced by a giant, and apparently quite horny, spider. Then our host explains to William that Peter and Evelyn are the repressed, dark sides of Dr. Will and Susan, and then William witnesses a bizarre ritual where Susan and Evelyn merge and make out with Peter while various nude and semi-nude people dance around, apparently (you guessed it) for Satan. Alas, Will\\'s will proves too strong for the dark side to claim him as well, and he escapes, only to find himself back at the site of the original car accident.<br /><br />If you think it all sounds rather confusing so far, keep in mind that, for the sake of brevity and comprehension, I\\'ve left out most of the really weird aspects of the film in the above summary. No, really.<br /><br />But the most interesting thing about Nude for Satan is that it appears that this film was a major influence on The Rocky Horror Picture Show. We\\'ve got an innocent, upstanding couple, who find themselves stranded in a castle after experiencing car troubles, and are gradually seduced to a life of vice and debauchery by its bizarre inhabitants. There\\'s a bedroom scene that matches Janet\\'s breakdown (\"But you did!\") right down to the heavily blue- and red-gelled lighting. And the clincher comes at the end, when Peter and Susalyn exactly mirror Frank and Columbia\\'s little frolic on the throne in RHPS\\'s ballroom scene, immediately followed by what could certainly be called a \"floor show.\" All in all, pretty much a must-see for the serious cult-movie fan. Say it with me again - \"Nude for Satan.\" Hee. That never gets old.',\n"," 'Think a darker version of one of those kid shows such as \"Power Rangers\" and you have this film from 1990, \"Robot Jox\". A movie where you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena and whoever comes out their country wins. The robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of the ones from said shows mainly because they are less colorful so while this movie is not good, it isn\\'t all bad to watch. There are as I recall two robot fights in this one, one that ends badly and the final showdown. There is a plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed, but in the end the plot is nothing that is going to stick with you for any amount of time after the picture is done. The fights themselves look like giant toys on the rampage, but still somewhat fun to watch. This movie would also spawn a couple of other films with similar plot devices such as the giant robots and the tournament. So it is worth checking out once, but probably not more than that.',\n"," 'This movie is widely acknowledged as being one of the worst sequels ever.

He was hot off \"Top Gun\" the year before, but he\\'s not a comedy director. He gives \"Beverly Hills Cop II\" his usual glossy look, but he mistimes all of the humour and it shows.<br /><br />You can tell a movie franchise is in trouble when it starts killing off its main characters and that\\'s what happens here when Ronny Cox is shot (Foley\\'s foul-mouthed boss, Inspector Todd, would be killed off in the next movie).<br /><br />Brigitte Nielsen, for the 5 minutes she was on Hollywood\\'s A-list, is in among the cast. She only got the part after Sylvester Stallone invited Eddie Murphy over for dinner (Sly apparently fell under the table laughing at Eddie\\'s Rocky impression).<br /><br />The screenplay for \"Beverly Hills Cop\" was nominated for an Oscar and that just goes to show you how good the original movie was. This movie got no such recognition. Actor and director Mel Smith once saw this movie at a Royal Premiere in London and he said: \"That is the biggest load of cr*p you will ever sit through in your life, I would have left, but you couldn\\'t as there was royalty there.\" I couldn\\'t agree more. You should only watch this film at gunpoint. Otherwise, don\\'t waste 2 hours of your life that you won\\'t get back.',\n"," 'This film is so bad and gets worse in every imaginable fashion. Its not just the poor acting and script nor is it the lame and perverse time one wastes on watching it. What really puts this film in my hall of shame is the apparent struggling that the writers and producers do with the film to try and make it funny. The actress replacing Jean Reno\\'s descendant is to old and learned her lesson in the first film so they add a new girl who is to be married. Nearly all of the original extras and gags return however this time makes me want to ripe my eyes out of my sockets because it\\'s a waste of perfectly good film. The torture of the constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer into violent convolutions. This second film takes the successful original and drags it out of its coffin and parades the corpse out in the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its legacy but our intelligence as well. This film unlike the spruce goose could not fly for it had no plot in the principals returning for a \\'necklace\\'. No script since it was apparently written and added to daily. No attention to camera or shots in mind. Poor lighting and special effects done for the sake of doing so. This film would not even pass for a student film in basic Film 101. How this pile got through no one can tell. It was a big loosing investment and it appears that no one had the strength to put this unnatural cruel mistake out of our miseries. This movie has one good part ...its END! This film is my #1 worst film of all time, finally \"Howard The Duck\" is no longer the goose.',\n"," 'For me the sequels to \"Dirty Harry\" never came close topping the original, but I thoroughly enjoyed and think highly of them anyway... well maybe with the exception of \"The Dead Pool\". Each one seemed to add its own distinguishable touch to the typical formula. The third film (and probably the cheapest, as it looks like it) of the series \\'The Enforcer\\' seemed to have that swinging and carefree vibe of the times, with the biting reality and stark realisations (heavily implemented in the first two) taking a backseat for forceful (if crass) humour. However the violence is still gritty, mean, explosive and openly displayed. Director James Fargo (\\'Forced Vengeance\\', \\'Every Which Way But Loose\\', \\'Caravans\\' and \\'A Game for Vultures\\') has appeared in some of Eastwood\\'s early films as assistant director, and here he paces it well-enough and let\\'s the foundation play out more like an expansive low-key action fling filled with the constant buddy routines (as Harry is paired up with a young green-horn female detective fidgety played by Tyne Daly. Who does bring an authentic and potent side to her role) that are credibly developed, long-winded build-ups finishing off with brute force and the quick-witted response. Harry also has got a catch-phrase\\x85 just \\'marvellous\\'.<br /><br />Eastwood laconically pulls it off with dominant ease and certain authority of truly delving into this character (as now there\\'s more to that monomaniacal search for one\\'s own justice), as his hands out punishment (against a bunch of terrorists who call themselves \\'The People\\'s Revolutionary\\') and has time to let fly what he really thinks. Copping the cynical barbs are amusing support performances by Harry Guardino, John Crawford and Bradford Dillman. The bad guys here aren\\'t overly memorable, but the DeVeren Bookwalter bestows a steely glance and has a quietly dangerous psychotic air to him. Showing up again, but in another different character is the wonderful Albert Popwell.<br /><br />I never tire of the San Francisco locations (where most of the films are shot), and the camera superbly details the on-screen action and striking background features. What I like about the ending of these earlier \\'Dirty Harry\\' films, was how they weren\\'t afraid to end on such an powerful note involving something represented visually to express the mindset, as the camera slowly zooms out and the harrowing score cues in. On the point about the music. I would say I was a little put off by the racy and bouncy jazz score arrangement of composer Jerry Fielding (who by-the-way has done some magnificent scores for films of Sam Peckinpah, Michael Winner and Clint Eastwood) just didn\\'t have the stinging, sombre and self-reflecting quality of Lalo Schifrin\\'s efforts. That\\'s not to say it was bad or felt out of place, because it didn\\'t with the feel that this one opted for. But a darker or more subtle take could\\'ve done it wonders since Fielding has chalked up some jarringly bold pieces in other films.<br /><br />The script has some political context (home-grown terrorism, political correctness and equal-gender opportunity), but always stays true to the story than trying to undermine or overdo it. While it should be predictable, it does keep one step ahead and offers a surprise or two.<br /><br />An up-to-par sequel.',\n"," 'I\\'m a filmmaker and I was amazed at how they put this movie together with the chimps. I\\'ve done one very short short called \"Giant Mice From Outer Space\" (youtube and veoh) with cats, ducks, dogs and deer and it took forever. The cinematography is perfect. The performances were very good considering this was tongue in cheek. I particularly liked Robbie Benson\\'s performance. <br /><br />This is a great movie kids will love and I suspect the low score here may be due to animal activists who feel chimps should not snowboard. <br /><br />Parents should just be warned that you kid(s) will probably say, \"Can I get a snowboard momma? It can\\'t be hard monkeys can do it.\"',\n"," \"The storyline of this movie is very ordinary and hard to believe in. Also, while showing the time lapse the director has neither taken enough care to show the discoloration of or changes in the sets used on the location, nor has he changed the make-ups of different actors who have aged by at least 10 years. The songs have just been inserted to 'showcase' the acrobatic 'talent' of one of the lead actresses. A repetition of such showcasing has made the movie very boring. The acting and dialog delivery of many actors does not seem to come out naturally, but rather seems to be forced out. Enough attention has not been given while writing the screenplay which has made it a very slow-moving storyline.\",\n"," 'I like this movie, but it is kind of strange. What I like most is that it is one of those movies about a town where strange things occur. I love those types of movies.

Investigating him, they run into many strange happenings as well as supernatural stuff and science fiction stuff as well. This is the best of the series for me.

It was also refreshing to see Jeremy Northam and Lucy Liu given leading roles and expanding their range as performers. This film also included one of the most imaginative \"escape\" scenes in recent years. The efforts of the director and the actors combined in an effective thriller.<br /><br />Although the plotting of the film was convoluted, the story progressed very clearly as the layers of corporate greed and skullduggery were revealed.<br /><br />In 1949, George Orwell suggested in his famous novel \"1984\" that the future would be ruled by the totalitarian State, which would control minds and diminish human liberty. It was interesting that in this intriguing futuristic film, it was not the State, but rather the corporate world that controlled and devalued the human worker.',\n"," \"Five Deadly Venoms is not as bloody and violent as Story Of Ricky or Super Ninjas, but it features some of the best hand-to-hand fight sequences in Hong Kong film history.

He would go on to be in Super Ninjas. Kuo Chui who is Philip Kwok would go on to Story Of Ricky and Hard Boiled. Any chop socky fan can apperciate this.

The movie presents the story of star-crossed lovers (one Israeli, one Palestinian)in modern Tel Aviv. The film's effectiveness comes not only from its depiction of cross-ethnic conflict, but of conflicts personal and political within ethnic groups as well. For example, there's a telling moment when one of the secondary characters, openly gay, is visited in the hospital by his boyfriend who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family, and suddenly we see a wave of awkward discomfort wash through the room. Clearly the young man is not as open as he seems, and the family not as accepting as he might want them to be, while the boyfriend is confused and rejected. A good deal of complexity is packed into a fleeting moment. As we know from Yossi & Jagger, Fox is a master at efficiently packing emotional and psychological complexity into brief sequences. The film is also effective for the even-handed way it presents the mutual brutalities that Israelies and Palestinians inflict on each other. If you're not heartless, you'll cry through the last third of the movie. Though the plot is melodramatic, it's so intelligently written and acted that it reminds us of how satisfying good melodrama can be.\",\n"," 'I never heard of \"Angus\" until it came on television. I watched it and loved the movie. I then went to Best Buy only to realize that Angus is not sold on DVD and VHS is near impossible to get a hold of. Thats when it hit me.<br /><br />Angus is a very under rated movie. It depicts a very real world of the years of Highschool. The main character is Angus, hence the title. An overweight, fat kid who has dreams to leave his town, while constantly thinking about his Dream Girl. His grades are good enough to go to a college out of the town to escape his outer demons. Demon, that being the star quarterback of the school and most popular kid, Rick, who picks on him and his friend. His main good relationships are with his Mom, Grandfather, and best friend. The plot point of the movie comes when Angus is chosen (by Rick as a joke) to go to the dance with his dream girl. Angus then must face his insecurities and step up. *At the end of the movie, Angus overcomes the troubles of high school and humiliates Rick, to get a kiss from his dream girl.<br /><br />The movie is just brilliant, with good character depth on all the characters. Even the dream girl, admits to Angus that she has an eating disorder. It is a shame that this movie has not been released on DVD yet.

At this hilltop therapy facility, Bob and Carol are getting to know themselves and each other, on a very deep level, through total honesty.

It\\'s funny, and at the same time, a little touching. The whole movie is like that. <br /><br />Carol is utterly converted to what she learns in therapy, and begins spreading the word to others, including friends Ted and Alice.

The movie picks a new main character but keeps the same cast and crew of the previous more successful and better Pink Panther movies. So basically it\\'s made in the same way as those other successful earlier Pink Panther movies but never does this movie work out as good as any other Pink Panther movie and it also is definitely the worst out of the long running series of movies.<br /><br />Problem is that this movie really doesn\\'t follow a script. Appereantly there is a main plot-line involving the Pink Panther again and Clouseau who is presumed missing. A New York cop is brought in to try and find Clouseau by picking up his trail he was on while investigation the disappearance of the Pink Panther. It basically starts off were \"Trail of the Pink Panther\" had ended, making this a direct sequel.<br /><br />Don\\'t be fooled by this movie its cast list people. Basically everywhere Ted Wass is listed somewhere like the 10th actor but he really actually plays the main lead within this movie. Actors such as David Niven, Robert Wagner, Robert Loggia and Burt Kwouk who are all listed higher are in it for like 10 minutes maximum. The reason they must have put David Niven on top of the billing must be done for commercial reasons or perhaps they were just being kind for him, knowing already how terminally ill at the time of making this movie he was. They even had to dub his voice, since he wasn\\'t able to speak up good enough anymore. This was also the last movie he appeared in before his death.<br /><br />So main lead is Ted Wass. Who? Exactly! He is one big nobody, without a real talent for acting or comedy. What was Blake Edwards when he casted him? Was he seriously thinking this would be the man that would be able to make us forget Peter Sellers? He is the type of actor that needs screaming and big surprised eyes to come across as being funny. He\\'s too forced in his acting. Also his character is supposed to be like the American version of Clouseau but instead of being clumsy or stupid, he more comes across as a victim of unlikely circumstances. He never really gets himself into trouble because of his own stupidity like Clouseau always did.<br /><br />It just isn\\'t a very funny or well made movie. It tries to follow a story but it just looks as if the movie simply doesn\\'t bother sticking to it. Appereantly it\\'s about the search for Clouseau but really, does he ever seriously attempt looking for him? He just randomly questions people and travels around the world.<br /><br />To me the movie gets still somewhat saved by the Roger Moore cameo. He actually shows that he has a great talent for comedy and actually would had been a worthy new Chief Insp. Jacques Clouseau for future movies in my opinion. Oh well, he probably was too expensive at the time to cast him for further Pink Panther, plus he of course at the time was still committed to playing James Bond, so no way they would had allowed him to play a different \\'cop\\' in a different comedy movie series. Also the presence of Herbert Lom and Burt Kwouk and other Pink Panther regulars, as well as the immortal Henry Mancini musical score compensate somewhat for the movie its totally inapt to entertaining or be funny. <br /><br />3/10',\n"," 'The painful memory of watching this movie when it was released 20 years ago lingers, like herpes.<br /><br />The only good thing about this movie are the unintentional howlers, such as the bad guys who live in the desert, and wear full-length fur coats (hmmmm, maybe not the best thing to wear when it is 120 degrees out).

Betty's time to shine comes when the diva star breaks her leg before opening night when she is hit by a car running away in a tantrum. The famous curse of Macbeth takes a more sinister and calculating turn when right away the body count begins to rise. It seems Betty gets her first fan via a stalker who ties her up and tapes needles to her eyes to force her to witness the grisly murders of the people around her. Story: 3 of 5<br /><br />Acting: Acting in a lot of these Italian films can sometimes be hard to judge. English, Italian, French, German, Spanish can sometimes all be in the same flick as they usually speak their native languages making dubbing rule of thumb and hard to judge. I usually cut them some slack in the area as a result. Acting: 4 of 5 <br /><br />Direction: Giallo maestro Argento enters again the genre helped pioneer. 'Opera' shows him at the top of his game with an exquisite blend of gore, tension and beauty. Direction: 4 of 5<br /><br />Visual: This has to be one of Argento's best looking films. Gorgeously filmed by Taylor, 'Opera' features some stunning and inventive camera-work that keeps the film running fast and hard and keeps the eye-candy coming. The camera always seems to be in notion whether it is a wonderful shot of the camera going up a spiral staircase or a sequence towards the end of a bird's eye view of said bird circling the crowd at the opera house. Visual: 5 of 5<br /><br />Audio: Frequent Argento collaborator Simonetti (through his various bands Goblin, Demonian and solo effort) compliments the screen action with zeal as his score touches from the classical (Verdi) to metal musings (with a little help from Brian and Roger Eno and Bill Wyman) and lends music muscle to the screen's bloody gristle. The sound design give you all that you need from stabbings to gunshots, fire to screams and masterfully remastered on the Anchor Bay disc in glorious 6.1 for every crunch and caw. Audio: 5 of 5<br /><br />Technical: The editing keeps the film flowing and moving wonderfully. Combined with the camera-work, the editing help keeps the surreal dreamy imagery flowing. The exquisite opera house is one hell of a location and perfect for staging the horror version of Macbeth. One can't end a review of an Argento film without having to comment on the kills. Argento dispatches characters with glee this time around with a brilliant stabbing sequence, crow eye-gouging and the film highlight of a gun blast through a keyhole into the eye and out the back of the head shot that once again sends Argento's ex-wife Daria Nicolodi to the movie morgue. Priceless! Technical: 5 of 5<br /><br />Wrap-up: A nearly flawless giallo that suffers from a slightly unnecessary epilogue in Switzerland that delivers all the visual thrills that Argento fans crave.<br /><br />Overall: 4 of 5\",\n"," 'You have to watch this movie for the pure enjoyment of witnessing Christopher Walken \"do his thing\"...

But because of the rambling nature of his question, the context regarding TV, and the bumblings of the interpreter, Woody misunderstands and takes it as literally referring to cathode tube radiation from the television set. It\\'s all kind of embarrassing. And also unfortunate, because what would have been an interesting question is then quickly brushed over.<br /><br />Perhaps this was all Godard\\'s intention.

Okay, you don't need to read any further now.<br /><br />I already guess most readers are older than the two protagonists of this picture, so I should say Ponyo is not so much a family film as a chance to remember the feeling of being a small child: discovering the world as you wanted to see it, making up your own rules and boasting an exuberant enthusiasm at doing things on your own for the first time. Ponyo swerves away from many of the problems that all-age films tackle. It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.<br /><br />The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen. They are not simple minded, arrogant or naive, just curious, enthusiastic and learning the ways of the world. They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with. Many films regard children from the outside, as the adult looking into a world only a child could enter. Ponyo brings everyone back to that world. In Ponyo, there lies the first time to learn and choose what you care about most, which the film values with high esteem. It is worth it to remember, to feel it again.\",\n"," \"I did not know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary. I knew it was about an ex-Viet Nam POW in Laos who escaped, but I didn't know much else. In reality, I wasn't expecting too much. Oh what a surprise! The story of this man's life is very interesting in itself, but what sets this film apart from other biography-type docs is that Dieter himself tells most of the story himself. Dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. His personality really shines. He tells his story about his life growing up in Germany during WWII and the hardships. We are there with him in that same small town as he describes his family, inspirations, and struggles. We follow him to America and his path to fulfilling his dream to be a pilot. Then later Dieter describes his story of capture, escape, and survival in the Laotian jungle. We are again with him in that very jungle as he describes and re-enacts his imprisonment and path to freedom with great detail. We see the same primitive huts, villagers, and forms of detainment he dealt with that really hasn't changed for 30 years. We see the thick jungle, mountain terrain, and rivers Dieter faced during his escape. It helps us to understand his emotions, pain, and plight. I enjoyed the man, the story, and the style.

After reading about this movie, I put my movie on my DVD player to observe a few details and wound up sitting through the whole movie, enjoying it from start to finish. And the following evening, I had to watch the movie again.<br /><br />The beginning with the outline of New York City as Nat King Cole\\'s \"Stardust\" played, was truly a magical combination, a high point with even more high points to come! Just what was it that made this movie so funny and so enjoyable? Was it the swash buckling washed out Alan Swann (played by Peter O\"Toole) as he moved from one situation after another? Or was it Benjy Stone (Mark Linn-Baker) as he tried unsuccessfully to keep Swann out of trouble, only to wind up becoming an involuntary accomplice to Swann\\'s wild schemes, and realizing that he was actually enjoying himself, having every bit as much fun as Swann? Maybe it was King Kaiser (Joseph Bologna), with his outrageous outbursts and unreasonable demands. King Kaiser\\'s writing staff with those connivers, ready to tell their boss off, only to turn into a team of cowardly \"yes-men\", the moment he showed up, is worth its weight in gold.<br /><br />Maybe it was the performance of Cameron Mitchell as Karl Rojeck as he had that face off with King Kaiser?<br /><br />Come to think of it, the correct answer here is \"all of the above\"! It was sad, though, to see Selma Diamond, with that cigarette dangling out of her mouth, knowing that within 3 years, her smoking would turn her into the \"Late Selma Diamoind\" as lung cancer would claim yet another life.<br /><br />The use of equipment used in the late 1950s as opposed to equipment used in 1954, is on little or no relevance unless you\\'ve been working in a television studio since the early 1950s.

However, as much as I like Kate Hudson her character was even a bit much.

The older, Mathilde (Elsa Zylberstein), is a wife and mother residing in a modern, developed country, but still living under marital rules and customs brought from her native Tunisia. She realizes that there are problems in her marriage, but doesn\\'t know where to turn for help. Seeking formal therapy would be out of the question. Instead, she receives counseling from the attendant at the mikva--the ritual bath. (This pivotal supporting role is portrayed beautifully by Aurore Clément. Another brilliant supporting actor is Sonia Tahar, who plays the girls\\' mother.)<br /><br />The part of the younger sister, Laura, is played by Fanny Valette. Laura is a brilliant philosophy student who works at night as a cleaner at a school. She falls in love with a young co-worker from the Muslim community, with predictably problematic results.<br /><br />This film could not be more timely--as I write this review, the immigrant communities in France (primarily Muslim), have risen in revolt against what they perceive as discrimination and prejudice against them within French society. Being an immigrant can never be easy. What makes it so hard is portrayed very well in this movie.<br /><br />La Petite Jérusalem offers a glimpse of a world most of us will never know. The district isn\\'t very attractive, and it\\'s certainly off the beaten path for tourists. The people who live in Petite Jérusalem have to cope as best they can.

I read a lot of reviews on here and it seemed that people felt this was an accurate portrayal of prison life. I have never been to prison but I highly doubt that many of the events that happened in the movie could occur in prison. The one specific scene that I am talking about is the near riot. The other problem I had with this movie was the overuse of Latino terms. I understand that these terms are used in real life but every other word was \"essay\"(sp) or \"homes\". This wouldn\\'t have been such an issue if the movie at least had some action between long drawn out conversations. The action was few and far between and I found myself dozing off many times. The thing that bothered me with this movie was the lack of a score. There was little to no background music to set the tone of a scene. This left the movie with a ton of awkward silences with the actors standing just making a silly facial expression for minutes at a time.

The odd<br /><br />candy colors are partly reminiscent of The Wizard of Oz and The<br /><br />King and I, but the total effect is disorientating, colder, more high<br /><br />pitched: its clashing colors dominated by the piercing fuschia red,<br /><br />but sometimes slanting off towards yellows, or sepias and soft<br /><br />blues. In European terms it's like seeing the paintings of<br /><br />Pontormo and Bronzino - a Mannerist palette on film. There is, I<br /><br />imagine a lot of filtering and digital enhancement here. It's<br /><br />self-conscious but no more so than any consistent vision has to<br /><br />be. So the color comes first.<br /><br />Immediately, you are pitched in an alternative reality of westerns<br /><br />(Sergio Leone mixed with Zorro) and romances, but comic as the<br /><br />'western' scenes are, these are not merely 'cool' parodies. The<br /><br />style everywhere refers to memory, of period, of genre: if it is irony it <br /><br />is a strange poignant irony in the service of poetry. The palette<br /><br />changes with the genre, as does the framing. Parts of it are<br /><br />presented as scenes in theaters.<br /><br />The story is simple enough but acute in its balance of belief and<br /><br />distance.

Shelly Fabares and Paul Peterson have often written and remarked that they were treated like the children of Donna Reed and Carl Betz, and that the adults were fiercely protective of the child actors, and treated them accordingly. Donna and Alex also had somewhat of a sexual chemistry that wasn\\'t seen on the other family shows. And the characters could be flawed, and in major ways, and yet, accepted for the flaws and mistakes. These were not super parents that did no wrong and had no emotional highs and lows. They were normal people acting as normal people.<br /><br />Women\\'s rights, drug abuse, child abuse, single fathers, poverty, children who need good health care but can\\'t afford it...it was all shown on this show. Pretty groundbreaking for the era.<br /><br />Donna Reed show didn\\'t last for eight years without a reason. And it could have possibly endured, had it not been for Tony Owens and Donna Reed divorcing.<br /><br />This show is highly underrated and should be shown so that other generations can appreciate quality.<br /><br />In summary, I agree with the original poster, who obviously cares for the show, but I think that the Donna Reed show has SO much more to offer than casual entertainment.',\n"," \"I saw this film when it first came out and hated it. I just saw it again 27 years later. I actually liked some of it... although Robin Williams was totally wrong for the role... What I remember most about hating the film is that it was almost the complete opposite of what I had understood when I read the book. Since I haven't re-read it, I can only give you my impressions from the past - but I am sure of one thing - the film is a paean to family life, whereas in the book, almost ALL traditional institutions - including, and perhaps especially, marriage - are shown to be strait-jackets that we would be well rid of. The only positive in the book is the wondrous nature of children...something that only the very beginning and ending of the film really captures (with that incredibly gorgeous baby floating in the air. Too bad Williams doesn't have a tenth of his charm!) My low mark is therefore from the fact that the film misrepresents the book. As a film on its own it fares better - but only for a few key performances. Mary Beth Hurt is wonderful - I think anyone watching it would fall in love with her. And John Lithgow as an ex football player who has had a sex-change operation is fantastic... he never once camped it up or made the character anything but commendable - and as such his performance had an incredibly integrity. I watched him closely during all of his scenes, and never once was he anything except womanly. Nothing in his performance ever came near the performance of a drag queen... and that made all the difference. In fact, of all the people in the film, his is the only one which is irreproachable. It is worth seeing this film only for his performance.\",\n"," 'I have to say this is the worst movie ever. However, there are some cool parts. First, the guy in the window, the door slamming shut by itself and of course the flashing by the girls nice boobs!!!

Part of the tradition is to humanize the beasts, to give them feelings, to make us feel for them. Here we\\'re giving an endless romance based on the real life Magliana band, a bunch of heartless, violent thugs that dominated the Roman gangland in the 70\\'s. Michele Placido and his script writers concoct a confused and confusing document that is as annoying, tedious and opportunistic as it is long, endless really. There is, however, one big plus in its favor, the actors. They are given a sketchy draw of their perverse characters but they go for it with body and soul. Kim Rossi Stuart\\'s tormented Freddo exudes a cutting pain that makes you think he has a conscience. Claudio Santamaria projects danger without even trying and the \"Libanese\" is played by an actor totally new to me, Pierfrancesco Favino, that gives the best performance by an Italian Actor in many, many moons. Riccardo Scamarcio has a face to launch a thousand ships but unfortunately no character and Stefano Accorsi is totally unbelievable in a character that is nothing short of absurd. Explosions, production values, American style editing, but very slow pacing, a brilliant dirty photography by the great Luca Bigazzi.

He is a consummate actor, a competent director, but a confusing writer. The photography in both Brooklyn and Argentina contains many scenes of breathtaking beauty.

Whatever, nowadays we need idealism more than ever, we need to believe in lost causes, we have to appeal to the dignity of the individual and to spit in the riches\\' faces. \"The Edukators\" is one way of doing all those things from the cinema screen by telling the story of three rebel young guys that won\\'t stay and look without doing a thing while the big corporations destroy this world and turn us into working-hard zombies. They have an idea: to assault mansions, mess everything up, to make trouble just to scare the owners... not to steal, not to break things. It is all about disconcerting.

Yes, it's silly and the plot and dialogue could be better, but it has the makings of a cult. I'm not a fan of slasher films, but I was intrigued by this because it's the first gay slasher film. Some of the photography was simply beautiful (the blood from the tattoo, the motorcycle ride, the bedroom scene). I've read criticism of Kirkwood's performance (Jake), that he seems uncomfortable, but he's playing a damaged, possibly broken hearted character, so his discomfort/awkwardness could be part of his performance. I think the scenes at the end, where he's vulnerable and clingy, are very well underplayed, poignant. The only criticism I have is that it's too short. At 85 minutes, there would have been plenty of time (at least 10 minutes) to give us a bit more story - I was dying to see Tobey (Matt Phillips) properly out of drag! I'd like to see a sequel, but I think if they were going to make one, they'd have made it by now... Or, six years later, the psycho killer could have escaped and is hellbent (hehe) on tracking down Jake and Eddie (who are still together and in love of course... or maybe they've split up (over some trivial misunderstanding) and the new danger brings them back together for a bitter reunion... but in the end they realise they still love each other...

The lion\\'s share of the footage in both is identical, but here is where they differ: In one version (the version I have seen most often on broadcast TV), the group of clerics guarding the gateway consists of the \"Brotherhood of the Protectors\", a (fictional) splinter group of priests and brothers \"excommunicated\" by the Church. In the other version, which I\\'ve seen only once on TV, the clerics guarding the gateway are depicted as priests of the official Church, meaning the Archdiocese of New York (or perhaps Brooklyn). Also, in the former version, in most of the pertinent scenes, the clerics are referred to as \"brothers\" (and in some scenes, you can see where the lips say \"Father\" so-and-so but the dubbed audio says \"Brother\" so-and-so. In the latter version, I believe everyone is referred to as \"Father\".<br /><br />In any event, it seems that one of these two versions is more or less a partial re-shooting of the other, with all \"Brotherhood of the Protector\" scenes re-shot as \"Archdiocese\" scenes, or vice versa.

This is beyond predictable, it doesn't even try to make you guess, the plot is the plot and there's no thinking outside the box here. I guess then the only reason to watch it is to see how it develops, but nothing is done originally or interestingly. There's not really anything to say about this film, it's not particularly bad, but there's no good points either. Russell plays Russell and you know what you're gonna get when you see him in a film. Ditto Liotta. Stowe has an annoying Cher-esque voice. I read the plot outline and I could see the film in my head, it was so obvious and basic. I watched it and it rolled out in front of my eyes exactly as I had imagined. I felt not a drop of emotion throughout. I have no feeling towards this film, it's as if I never even watched it.

Annabel Chong (Grace Quek) is an exceptionally complex human being: highly intelligent yet quite psychologically damaged. Watching the film is like being on amphetamines - the first half is hyper-frenetic and luridly self-congratulatory, but then the \"come-down\" happens. And when it comes, it hits hard.<br /><br />I did some follow-up research. Ironically, this documentary gave Annabel Chong the financial rewards that her gang-bang didn\\'t, and she earned enough to buy a house and return to college. She is currently completing a course in web-design/networking. She appears to be earning her living by operating a website that combines her discussions of Windows 2000 installations with subscriber-only pornographic photos of herself and others.

This reconstruction gives us more or less a taste of what this picture might have looked like on the screen but I think TCM failed to understand the allure of London After Midnight. Most Chaney fans accept the fact that London After Midnight received poor to lukewarm reviews but Chaney\\'s make-up and characterization through the photos we have left have left us fascinated. The Chaney fan in me wants the much better film The Miracle Man to be found but the kid in me wants London After Midnight. This make-up is some of the best in film history, I argue that the vampire in London After Midnight is Chaney\\'s finest make-up and the picture hasn\\'t been seen by mainstream audiences in 80 years.<br /><br />I can tell that the best people were involved with this reconstruction of the picture and that they meant well but inevitably people will be disappointed. London After Midnight without action is exactly what it has been all along, lifeless. The fact that all we have left are these still photographs doesn\\'t quench our thirst in the least bit, it makes us even thirstier. I know Lon Chaney\\'s characterization and performance must have been fascinating and when we see that outstanding make-up in a narrative fashion we want to see it move with life. Browning\\'s sense of the macabre and the atmosphere of terror are all too ingrained in what we have left.<br /><br />The finished product? It\\'s actually watchable, I know a lot of people complain about reconstructions but I thought this one was okay. The narrative is pretty much intact even when they have trouble finding images for scenes. The crew even gives us some seldom seen photos which show the supporting cast give some interesting interpretations of their characters. My favorite thing about this production was the score which is outstanding, very dark and foreboding and much like what this film probably was scored with in the 1920\\'s.<br /><br />As for the plot, I\\'ll put my money that many people would be disappointed if London After Midnight was found because they didn\\'t grasp the plot. Tod Borwning\\'s 1935 remake Mark of the Vampire is in essence a faithful remake and it has been panned for it\\'s \"fake vampires\". Chaney plays a Scottland Yard detective named Burke who uses hypnosis and fear to try to find the murderer of Roger Balfour. Burke is in fact the Vampire who haunts the Balfour mansion, he plans to scare the killer into a confession. Not many people like the plot after reading it and seeing this reconstruction, I do. Chaney is playing something he seldom got to play, a smart man and a hero at that. Is the plot a little far fetched? Undoubtedly so but this is Tod Browning we are talking about here with Lon Chaney in the lead role. With the atmosphere and a great performance by Chaney I have no doubt that this film could have been good even great.<br /><br />The loss of London After Midnight is all the more tragic because it is the crucial representation of how badly the studios took care of their films in the early days of motion pictures. Lon Chaney was without a doubt one of the best actors who ever lived and yet less than 50% of his filmography is left to judge him with. If you want London After Midnight to be found donate to film preservation programs. I hope and pray that London After Midnight is found in some dusty old attic one day but until then this is what we have and I applaud TCM for trying to satisfy the fans who mourn the loss of burnt nitrate from MGM;s vault 7.',\n"," 'I just have to say that this movie was horrible.

I was also intrigued at the fact it was a talkie; my first one, Chaplin-wise.<br /><br />The start is typical Chaplin and blatant proof that when it comes to sound, Chaplain can cut it whilst not solely relying on music to set mood and to do the talking; it's funny, well timed and the elements of slapstick such as falling off an anti-aircraft gun are well tied in with the jokes. It was good to draw the viewer in with this 'classic Chaplin' opening and at the same time, kick start the narrative of characters getting to know one another. What was also well done was the way in which Hitler is spoofed. Any scene involving Hitler or 'Hynkel' in this film, was funny and even now; makes you think back as you know exactly who he's spoofing and does create an internal reaction of some kind. The way in which English in mixed in with the mock German during the dialogue scenes is further proof of the way Chaplin managed to adapt to the talkie era. My favourite joke was the five minute speech Hynkel gave, only for the English translator to translate it into a mere few words; making you think back to footage of Hitler you may have seen giving a speech at some point in your life and, indeed, laugh at him.<br /><br />Historically, the film got a few things right as well. Hynkel is seen getting his photograph taken with children; something Hitler did for recognition as he manipulated the media but here, Hynkel is seen to yawn and act bored; stabbing at Hitler's underhand technique of winning over the German public through sympathy (Oh, he hugs and kisses children. He must be OK!). The film is also given a fantastic premise of a Jewish civilian reinstalled into the ghetto amongst all the travesties going on but with the catch that he is oblivious. Films such as 'The Pianist' and 'Come and See' are two good examples of Nazi cruelty towards 'inferior' people which nowadays, we can all look back on and shake our heads at whereas back in the late 1930's when this was filmed, the fact he had the cruelty going on and was exploiting it makes it even more an astounding achievement. Chaplin has managed to replace guns and truncheons for tomatoes and saucepans and still pulls it off.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the film, however, was the fact it settled into an actual narrative after the opening. This slowed the film up and this is very noticeable as the foot was taken off the gas somewhat. The film started to hint at stories and sub-stories. These included the barber and the female neighbour falling in love and the supposed destruction of Hynkel's palace whereas none of these were actually developed. The 'giving a woman a shave' and the 'whoever has the coin in their pudding does the deed' gags were hinting at these plot paths but in the end, just materialised into nothing but excuses for drawn out, unfunny gags which was disappointing.<br /><br />During the final straight, The Great Dictator gets a boost from the fact the Italian dictator is introduced who adds some much needed life and excuse for comedy to the film. It works a treat as we see them argue and more underhand tactics are exploited when Hynkel attempts to 'overpower' his Italian counterpart through a series of dirty tricks (although, they are humorously foiled). Despite a few weaknesses in pacing during the middle segment and the fact I felt the message at the end was a little forced down my throat, The Great Dictator holds up for viewing today but that's only because he took the gamble of exploiting things nobody else really knew were there.\",\n"," '***SPOILERS*** A hot and sexy Linda Blair as the Witch Amelia Reynolds is very upset with her friend and rival Witch across town Erica Barens, Julie Strain.

As he\\'s made to runs into the Reynolds\\' house, under her control, as mad as a hatter trying to murder both her and the crippled Hal. <br /><br />Larry Parks looked and acted so weird that you had the feeling that he accidentally walked onto the set of \"Sorceress\" and ended up being in the cast playing his part as Stan. Without the help or benefit of a script he improvised his way through and then slowly realized just how god-awful bad the movie really is. Stan getting killed off early in the film was a big plus for him since he didn\\'t have to suffer,like those of us watching, through the entire brainless and mind-numbing movie.<br /><br />It becomes evident to you as well as it did to the makers of \"Sorceress\" that all this shenanigan\\'s on the screen has to come to some kind of hopeful and successful conclusion and a trick ending is put in to finally end the movie. The ending is about the best thing, besides Miss Blair and the rest of the very well-endowed woman cast, that one can say about the film.',\n"," \"Easily one of the best Indian films ever. Granted, that's not saying much(I made this conclusion after a whopping 15 minutes of watching). But I can truly say that Fire is also one of the really beautiful and brilliant films I've seen.<br /><br />Beautiful because of its imagery. The best example I can give is the parallelism between the 2 female leads(Radha and Sita) and the characters of the same name in Hindu mythology. Sita, for example, is the wife of the revered Lord Ram. As legend goes, Ram subjugates his wife by making her walk through a Fire to prove her `purity.' Sita, in response, cries and leaves him, reuniting with her mother(the Earth). This story has all sort of crazy links to the stories of the 2 Indian women(Nandita Das and Shabana Azmi). The word `Fire' all of a sudden has many meanings - marriage, tradition, religion, motherhood, and probably a few others I didn't catch.<br /><br />Brilliant because of its social overtones. Many who were offended by the premise for this movie should in fact be first to see Fire(e.g. my mom, who actually loved it). Why? Because although Fire is an attack on tradition, it is also an attack on tradition. In other words, that is its strength, NOT its weakness. Traditional conservative social mores(whether Indian or Canadian or American or whatever) are useless if they enslave you. Gender roles and self-denial can both do this.<br /><br />These are the things I took with me after seeing Fire.

Well, it is a romantic comedy, and maybe a little dated. However, it is not overly sentimental, touching as it does on themes of office politics, adultery, and loneliness.

But, there is enough wit and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic. If you meet someone who doesn't like this movie, seriously consider how well you want to know them.\",\n"," 'I really enjoyed watching this movie and I wish to recommend to as many people as possible. But maybe biased because I\\'m a huge fan of director Stuart Gordon. I have yet to see a movie of his that doesn\\'t fully lives up to my expectations. From Re-Animator over Dolls to Castle Freak...they all belong to my favorite horror movies. And I do believe Gordon belongs to the most talented directors in the genre because he can handle all sort of horror topics. His debut - the brilliant Re-Animator - was a comedy splatter movie while The Pit and the Pendulum doesn\\'t contain that much violence or gore. This movie contains an intelligent and even educational story and it has great settings and costumes of the 14th century. <br /><br />The Pit and the Pendulum is an adaptation of the famous short story by Edgar Allen Poe. The master of low budget - Roger Corman - already used this story once to make a great horror classic starring Vincent Price. Stuart Gordon\\'s movie isn\\'t really a remake of that one. They just used the same plot. Pit and the Pendulum takes place during the Spanish Inquisition. Lance Henriksen plays one of the best roles of his entire career as Torquemada. He decides whether \"witches\" are guilty or not and when they\\'ll be burned for the eyes of God. A young girl, Maria ( played by Ronna De Ricci who never did anything else in her career )who resists against his way of working is being arrested. Torquemada wants to accuse her of witchery but he\\'s fascinated by her looks and her body. Meanwhile, Maria\\'s husband entered the castle and he wants to free his wife. <br /><br />The atmosphere and the settings impress the most in this movie. The ancient castle and the torture chambers are really intriguing. The costumes are terrific as well. There isn\\'t too much gore and violence to detect in this movie ( especially not compared to previous Gordon movies ) but they\\'re are a few very explicit scenes that show true horror. But it\\'s always shot with a lot of style and class. Even though Lance Henriksen is getting all the attention in this movie, there are a a few other great performances in this movie. I\\'d like to bring forward Jeffrey Combs...my favorite B-movie actor and frequently cast by Stuart Gordon. His role is pretty limited but very well acted.<br /><br />The Pit and Pendulum is warmly recommended to fans of atmospheric horror and historical stories. One to watch !!',\n"," 'This 1936 film is a great film Classic with outstanding veteran actors who made this into a great dramatic story concerning Lady Helen Dudley Dearden, (Loretta Young) who tries to protect her husband from a past relationship with a young woman. Sir Alan Dearden (Franchot Tone) is an outstanding lawyer who is about to be chosen as Attorney General and his wife Lady Helen is being blackmailed by Hugh Lewis (Henry Daniell) with a bunch of love letters that Sir Alan had sent to this woman. The story gets quite involved with a man being accused of killing his wife and also another murder of a woman Sir Alan had an affair with. There is a very tricky ending to this film that you will not be able to figure out until the very ending of this film. Roland Young, (William \"Bunny\" Jeffers ) gave a great supporting role to this great film classic.',\n"," 'I saw this movie originally on the \"Wonderful world of Disney\",long before I read the book for an education class in college. I also taught my 8th grade language arts class part of James Otis\\' wonderful speech about the price of independence. I do not remember if the speech is in the film,but if it was it was wasted because the powers that be at Disney in 1956 decided to change the ending. A previous review mentioned the same thing... by not allowing the character of Rab Silsbee to die after the Battle of Lexington, the entire perspective of the film disappears. I once had a father ask me if it was OK if his son,who did not want to read the book, watched the movie , I told him sure, if he wanted to fail the class.... the teacher would have known immediately that he had not read the book,because he would have no clue about \"that a man can stand up\".<br /><br />That said, the movie is well cast,especially the characters of Dr Warren, Paul Revere and James Otis.(Jeff York as always was wonderful).<br /><br />Hal Stalmaster, who never to my knowledge made another film is just fair as Johnny.Dick(Richard)Beymer is a little goofy as Rab and has fun with the part(unfortunately it doesn\\'t go anywhere.)Luana Patten as Cilla was too old for the part.

All with the methodic and reasoned approach that a group of scientist will do in the real life. The team of scientist with absolutely nothing in common except for their knowledge, and the boring-not ''pretty people'' looks of all of them (the female character looks like my oldest aunt). That and a believable story behind it...............<br /><br />All it's gone in the miniseries.......A few points on the plus side: beautiful scenery, the laboratory amazing and realistic, the same for the computer graphics, viral-bacterial culture devices and the electron microscope.<br /><br />But the story has so many loose ends :the wife and son of the lead scientist has absolutely no purpose at all, not even to influence the actions of Ben's Bratt character; no clear progression around all the Andromeda discoveries; the continuous mutations of the agent ''explaining'' everything (with no sense at all); and the environmental message some screenwriter (a drunken one i'm sure) put with forceps into the story.<br /><br />And: 'la creme de la creme': a wormhole!!!!!!!!!!!! and a coded information from the future (insert here dramatic music).<br /><br />It's amazing for me to see how a number of good pictures, series, miniseries are continuously destroyed year after year during the past decade. This one is another example of the trend.<br /><br />Do yourself a huge favor: if you are capable of being entertained by the Sci-fi genre, only watch the original movie, and you will be safe..........until Hollywood looks up again in the movie database.\",\n"," 'Ah, another example of everything that is wrong with Hollywood.

Right up there with \"Watching paint dry\" and \"Trading Spaces: They Hated It\".<br /><br />Fake characters. Too many swear words. Some movies choose their one magic F bomb with care; this one fires them out like farts from a teenager.<br /><br />For David D. fans, save yourself an aneurism and fire up \"House of D\" again.

The Spanish ambassador in London Count de Polan (Robert Warwick) sends a recommendation letter to his friend Queen Margaret (Viveca Lindfors) to give an opportunity in the court to rehabilitate Don Juan from the gossips and rumors about his love affairs, and he is hired as instructor of the art of fencing in the Spanish Academy. He secretly falls in love for Queen Margareth but becomes loyal to her and her irresponsible and weak husband, King Phillip III (Romney Brent). Don Juan discovers the plan of the Machiavellian Duke de Lorca (Robert Douglas) that intends to declare war to England and rules Spain. With the support of his friends, Don Juan defends the Queen, the King and Count de Polan against Duke de Lorca and his men.<br /><br />\"The Adventures of Don Juan\" is a charming, witty and delightful adventure full of romance and comedy. Unfortunately the cinema industry forgot how to make awesome movies like this one without the need of sex scenes or gore and sadism. The athletic Errol Flynn is amazing, fighting with foil and seducing the women in the story and the audiences in the real world, using intelligent and witty lines. The gorgeous Viveca Lindfors performs a queen with stylish elegance and class. The traitor Robert Douglas is the perfect villain, with treachery, ambition and Machiavellism. In the end, this movie is highly recommended for the whole family as a great entertainment.

A masked killer is terrorizing the<br /><br />small town and there are plenty of suspects: town bad boy Frankie,<br /><br />Ingrid\\'s mysterious uncle Carl, and the new stranger guy in town.<br /><br />The sheriff, played by Aldo Ray, is perplexed. He finds out his<br /><br />daughter was knocked up by Frankie, plus he must deal with<br /><br />having two Barney Fifes as deputies. Ingrid is also having many<br /><br />visions/hallucinations involving her mother, who killed herself after<br /><br />a tryst with a strange man. Ingrid, just five years old, walked in on<br /><br />them and mom fled into the bathroom. It is no mystery that the<br /><br />man in bed with mom was mom\\'s brother, Uncle Carl.<br /><br />Ingrid is attacked by the masked killer but escapes. Later, the killer<br /><br />murders the local town lush and dumps her body in Ingrid\\'s<br /><br />chicken coop. Ingrid is later raped by Frankie, and Uncle Carl<br /><br />almost walks in on them. Frankie threatens Ingrid if she talks, and<br /><br />the murders in town continue. Ingrid is a fixture at church, and is<br /><br />almost raped again after an attack in the cemetery. Eventually, the<br /><br />masked killer turns out to be the mysterious stranger. Frankie,<br /><br />however, shows up at Ingrid\\'s house, bounds Uncle Carl, but is<br /><br />stabbed to death by Ingrid. Carl buries Frankie, makes an<br /><br />incestuous pass at Ingrid, then disappears after Ingrid goes to the<br /><br />sheriff.<br /><br />The sheriff guards Ingrid\\'s house until the morning, when the<br /><br />deputies can come and dig up Frankie. Instead, Frankie pulls up<br /><br />very much alive, and the deputies find a grave with Ingrid\\'s goat.<br /><br />Ingrid is upstairs in the bathroom, dead from suicide.<br /><br />The sheriff also gets a surprise when Uncle Carl flies in from New<br /><br />York. He has not seen Ingrid in years, despite Ingrid\\'s claims to<br /><br />the contrary. Uncle Carl visits Ingrid\\'s house, and remembers how<br /><br />he slept with his sister before he drowned her in the bathtub, she<br /><br />did not commit suicide. The final scene, the scariest in the film,<br /><br />has Mitchell in the bathroom, running hot and steaming water, and<br /><br />turning around to see a misty figure standing in the bathtub- Ingrid.<br /><br />This thumbnail sketch might make this sound very suspenseful,<br /><br />almost Hitchcockian, but it is far from it. May Britt, as Ingrid, tries,<br /><br />but she is failed by the script. Her Scandinavian accent is<br /><br />explained away as she spent time in \"a European orphanage up<br /><br />the coast.\" Huh? Cameron Mitchell, who has never been good in<br /><br />anything, is not good here. The film makers give him the world\\'s<br /><br />worst fake gray hair at the film\\'s conclusion: the chalk white goop<br /><br />looks like it was applied with a trowel. The rest of the cast plays<br /><br />their routine small town characters without adding anything new.<br /><br />The biggest mistake here is the convoluted script. There are at<br /><br />least six different places toward the end of the movie where the<br /><br />final credits should have started rolling. Clocking in at 97 minutes,<br /><br />this is fifteen minutes too long. Poor Britt spends most of her<br /><br />screen time either taking off her clothes (careful not to show any<br /><br />nudity) or hysterically running away from men, real or imagined. All<br /><br />the men here come off as horny and stupid. Ingrid is the<br /><br />repressed frigid queen who fantasizes about being attacked and<br /><br />raped. She is religious, and Hollywood has been telling us for<br /><br />years how strange and sexually repressed churchgoers are. The<br /><br />script never takes any chances, beating the viewer over the head<br /><br />with heavy handed images from Ingrid\\'s psychotic mind. While<br /><br />there is some suspense here and there, for a horror film, there is<br /><br />not much.<br /><br />The possibilities here were endless, and the film makers did not<br /><br />take advantage of them. This should have been very suspenseful,<br /><br />considering the game cast, but everyone loses to a silly script and<br /><br />terribly low budget. \"Haunts\" does not haunt.<br /><br />This is rated (R) for physical violence, some gun violence, sexual<br /><br />violence, some profanity, some sexual content, and adult<br /><br />situations.',\n"," 'This movie is funny in more ways than one.

I can only to say that there is much better films about Hitler and Germany in those years and that Rise of evil is very much under average. I can recommend German film Downfall in which you can see brilliant performance of Switzerland actor Bruno Ganz in a roll of Adolf Hitler.',\n"," 'I saw Chan Is Missing when it first came out, about four years after moving from San Francisco to New York. Maybe it was the perspective of a few years away, but this movie seemed to capture the essence of the city and its people better than anything else I\\'d ever seen (still does). It concentrates on one particular community - the Chinese - but that\\'s fine, because so much of the city\\'s soul is refracted through the settings, the faces, and the maybe above all the voices of the characters.<br /><br />This isn\\'t the tourists\\' San Francisco. The settings are humble and everyday: a taxi cab, the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant, Richmond District row houses, little Chinatown apartments and small-business offices, the piers, a Philippine elder center. This is what the city looks and feels like day to day to the people who live there - even now, in the era of Silicon Gulch urban redevelopment. Unlike, say, Dirty Harry (in its own way an excellent San Francisco movie as well), everything is filmed at street level: We come to understand the characters\\' points of view from the perspective their surroundings give them, not from some fancy vertiginous shooting.<br /><br />Wang apparently filmed in B&W because he didn\\'t have the money to do otherwise, yet one of the strongest visual elements of the movie is the natural light he achieves. The often harsh, pervasive quality of the sunlight is one of my closest associations with San Francisco: It seems to expose everything, bringing the buildings, the hills, the other landmarks down in scale and, in a funny way, making the people you pass on the streets seem more individual and potentially closer to you than they might in another place. Wang\\'s photography perfectly conveys this, and even helps the story along at points.<br /><br />Wang captures the speech and conversational style of Chinese and other San Franciscans better than anyone ever has, I think. If there\\'s such thing as a true San Francisco \"accent,\" it\\'s what you hear from the balding taxi medallion broker (I think) who appears talking on the phone in one scene (listen to the way he calls the person on the other end \"ya dingaling!\").<br /><br />The story is poignant and, despite a few very small missteps, makes its points beautifully about the longings that pull at the hearts of people living in old immigrant communities - including the justified political and ethnic resentments, and little ironic amusements, that help to fuel them. All this is communicated delicately - perhaps why some respondents here think the film meanders. It doesn\\'t - suffice it to say that the two cab drivers\\' quest for Chan becomes a quest for something more personal.<br /><br />Chan Is Missing finishes up with a Chinatown travelogue sequence backed by a goofy novelty song from the 1930s (I guess) about San Francisco and all its crazy diversity. An American caricature, yes, but somehow not entirely off the mark either.',\n"," \"The truth is that about 80% of the people who see (have seen) this movie won't like it. Why? Because it is not that original. But in saying that, I happen to belong to the 20% who really like it.<br /><br />I first saw it back in the eighties when I was about 8 or 9 years old. Now almost 20 years on I saw it again, and it really brought back nostalgic memories from when I was a kid.<br /><br />Some people say this movie has bad acting. I don't agree at all. While the story might not be the best ever, there is definitely nothing wrong with the acting. And the supersonic Maiden One plane looks absolutely stunning, even though it is 70's B-TV-movie material.<br /><br />I really recommend it to fans of disaster movies.

Can\\'t believe this film got made!',\n"," 'More people telling me their favourite film, have named Excalibur, than have chosen any other film. People tend to feel strongly about this film. I can remember that when it came out, a film magazine reviewed it twice, feeling that it had to do so, since its two reviewers had such contrasting opinions. In short, people who don\\'t adore it, tend to hate it.<br /><br />Those who hate it have failed to understand something very important: that it is set in the land of dreams. Excalibur makes no attempt to be realistic. It is the film of a legend, and it tries to create a world of legend, and it succeeds. Once one has realised that this is not the real world, then the film is internally consistent and works splendidly. Merlin, towards the end of the film, even says the line \"Your love brought me back to where you are: in the land of dreams.\" If anything, this makes the film even more tragic, because all of Arthur\\'s sufferings have been not for his world, but for ours.<br /><br />The Arthurian legend is probably the world\\'s best legend. It has been told a thousand different ways, but is so strong, that no retelling can harm it. The story is familiar, but this telling of it is not. The screen starts blank, with the distant drums of Seigfried\\'s Funeral March playing, and after a few captions, the curtain lifts to reveal a stunning opening sequence with horses breathing fire-lit breath into the night air, as Uther\\'s men do battle with those of the Duke of Cornwall. The armour is dark, and greenish, and the movements slow, making this seem like a scene of battling dinosaurs. It is brutal and bloody. These are the dark ages. This is the time of chaos from which Arthur\\'s kingdom must come. Into the scene, in a cloud of swirling fog, comes a figure who will be present throughout the film, ageless and mysterious, Nicol Williamson\\'s Merlin, whose voice carries over the din.<br /><br />I remember how suddenly I found myself immersed in this world when I first saw the film, and even now the hairs stand up on the back of my neck thinking about it. Allow yourself to become involved with the film, and you will be rewarded.<br /><br />The costumes are magnificent. Special mention must go to the shining armour, and Morgana\\'s (Helen Mirren) ever-increasingly impressive series of outfits. The music is stirring (it uses \"O Fortuna\" from Carima Burana before this had become a cliche). The acting is theatrical and good. Each of these characters is on a stage, to be examined. This is not a film of quiet intimate moments. It is a legend, and legends are public.<br /><br />Excalibur distills the Arthurian legends into one film of watchable length very cleverly. At several points during it, a clever cut tells the viewer that several years have passed. Single characters represent many things. At one point Sir Percival represents all the questknights, at another Morgana is all that is evil. In telling the story quickly, the film uses simple direct speeches. In one scene, Arthur visits Guinevere, the woman he loved deeply, whom he hasn\\'t seen for many years. He spends just a minute in her company and leaves, and yet the speech he delivers to her is so complete and so moving, that you do not feel robbed. He says his piece and leaves, needing to say no more.<br /><br />It is true that the film has dated a little. Some of the hair-styles and special effects are not quite what they would be today, and the quality of the dubbing is not first-rate, but this is still stunning. Everything seems to have come together to help this film look and sound good. The skies over the castles are spectacular, the Irish landscape (it was shot there) looks the part. The visual imagination and daring to have Camelot as a castle literally made from silver, and to have Arthur\\'s final battle fought in fog with a huge blood red sunset behind it, makes this a feast for the eye.<br /><br />I am writing about one of my all-time favourite films. I cry every time I see the land burst into blossom as a reborn Arthur gallops through it, and I feel the heavy warmth of tragedy as he is carried off towards the sunset to the Isle of Avalon. I am spoiling nothing by telling you that Arthur dies in the end. Everyone knows that he dies in the end. The whole film is leading to that moment. When you reach the end of the film, ask yourself this: where did he go wrong? What was it he did to lose his wife, his son, his sister, his best friend, all his questknights, Merlin, his kingdom, his life - everything he held dear?<br /><br />\"The one god of the many comes to drive out the many gods. The spirits of wood and stone grow silent. It is a time for men and their ways.\" That\\'s it.<br /><br />',\n"," '\"A Damsel in Distress\" is definitely not one of Fred Astaire\\'s better musicals. But even Astaire\\'s bad films always had some good moments.<br /><br />In \"Damsel,\" Astaire is Jerry Halliday, an American musical star who is in London on a personal appearance tour. He meets Lady Alice Marshmorton (19-year-old Joan Fontaine), a beautiful English heiress, who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers.<br /><br />Jerry believes that Alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt. He tries to rescue her from her family\\'s country manor house, but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor Lady Alice will marry. Keggs (Reginald Gardiner) the conniving butler, and Albert (Harry Watson), the bratty house boy, each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging Lady Alice\\'s romance with Jerry to make sure they win the bet.<br /><br />This musical has numerous problems. First, there is the plot, based on a novel by P.G. Wodehouse (who co-wrote the screenplay). The story is slow, painful, and nerve-grating. When Fred is not dancing, we have to endure endless annoying scenes of (a) Fred romancing Joan Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert conniving against them and each other.<br /><br />The butler and the house boy are especially irritating. They are one-dimensional stock villain characters, the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth. You wish they would get off the screen and let Fred dance.<br /><br />Astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film, and is miscast in a musical. She has little going for her, character-wise, other than her lovely face and beautiful smile.<br /><br />George Burns and Gracie Allen are along for the ride, as Jerry\\'s publicist and his ditzy secretary. The duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot, and Gracie has some funny lines, but she is also very annoying at times.<br /><br />The direction of the movie by George Stevens is not well done. At times, the cinematography is horrible and off-focus. There are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets, to try to convince the audience that we are in London, not Hollywood. (They must have used tons of dry ice in this movie.) On the plus side, the songs by George and Ira Gershwin are terrific, and have become classic song standards. And of course, the dancing in the movie is exceptional, thanks to Astaire and his choreographer, Hermes Pan.<br /><br />But the musical and dance numbers are ill-used and ill-staged. At times, the cast seems to start singing and dancing because, well, it\\'s time for them to start singing and dancing. The musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot. (At one point, the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason.) The numbers include: \\uf0b7 \"I\\'m Dancing and I Can\\'t Be Bothered Now\" -- Fred dances well on a foggy traffic-filled London street. He does some great \"cane-twirling\" with a rolled umbrella -- but the number ends too soon when Fred jumps on a passing double-decker bus. (In the Broadway musical, \"Crazy For You,\" Harry Groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls.)<br /><br />\\uf0b7 \"Put Me To The Test\" -- Fred, George, and Gracie do a trio tap dance in an English cottage. George and Gracie match Fred step for step, but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason.<br /><br />\\uf0b7 \"Stiff Upper Lip\" (The Fun House Number) -- At an amusement park fun house, Fred, George, and Gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor, rotating barrel, and with the fun house mirrors. It\\'s the best number of the movie, but it gets a little repetitious at times.<br /><br />\\uf0b7 \"Things Are Looking Up\" -- Fred and Joan Fontaine do their one dance number together in the film, prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate. Fortunately, it\\'s a very simple dance number because Joan is not a great dancer.<br /><br />\\uf0b7 \"A Foggy Day in London Town\" -- Fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night, crooning about the foggy day when he first met Joan in London. At times, he looks as if he\\'s not sure which way he\\'s going in the fog -- much like the musical number itself.<br /><br />\\uf0b7 \"Nice Work If You Can Get It\" -- A great song that is misused in the movie. During a social event at the manor house, Fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour-faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song. Each time Fred joins in, the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave. (Again, Harry Groener did a better dance number with this song in \"Crazy For You.\") \\uf0b7 \"Drum Dance Number\" -- As Fred and Joan are eloping, Fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums. As usual, it\\'s a great dance number. But there\\'s absolutely no need for it, except to prolong the movie.<br /><br />The most contrived moment in the film comes when Fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for Joan Fontaine. As he leaps from the balcony, he finds a conveniently-placed trapeze -- that\\'s right, a *trapeze* -- hanging from a nearby tree. Fred (or rather, a stuntman in Fred\\'s clothes) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it.<br /><br />The movie is worth owning on DVD for the dance numbers alone, but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the Fast Forward button on your remote. The >>FF button allows you to skip through the other, boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers.',\n"," \"In The Book of Life, Martin Donovan plays Jesus, who shows up at JFK airport on December 31 to usher in the new millennium by battling with Thomas Jay Ryan (Satan) and deciding the fate of the world. There is also David Simonds (Kurt the accountant from Amateur) as a compulsive, homeless gambler.<br /><br />As usual, Hartley creates a surreal world in which the beauty of the ordinary made strange and otherworldly flows through artfully-framed scenes and urban/industrial landscapes filled with dazzling light and shadow. As usual, he introduces seemingly incidental details early, then brings them back later in hilarious and unexpected contexts--the humor is simple, but giddy and irrepressible. Hartley has an amazing ability to build toward small and rapturous moments of the simultaneously mundane and outrageous. As usual, he creates a tone that is jaded and world-weary but at the same time, vulnerable, open, and honest. He moves within minutes from uproarious humor into language that is metaphysical and poetic-the kind of writing that is so dead-on and perfect that it's difficult to hold back tears despite the lack of obvious emotion. Another awesome and highly entertaining film. The Book of Life is shot (a digital camera?) with a blurry effect: a sense of the celestial hand-in-hand with impending doom and a hyper-awareness of the present as fragile and fleeting in it's last moments. All of Hartley's films have a way of prioritizing the present, but this unique effect compounds it as the images wash across the screen in a way that is at first jarring, but becomes increasingly beautiful as you settle into it. The final shot is spectacular. All this may sound precious, but the film is a comedy and it makes fun of itself even as it makes fun of the concept of Armageddon, Judgment Day, and `urbanity.' Although it is actually quite profound, moving, and life-affirming, it is for the most part lighthearted and playful. The acting is flawless in terms of the kind of the subdued tone that Hartley has developed in his films (a tone that some people don't get and that prompts them to judge such acting as hollow--the same people who have a negative response to Peter Greenaway). As always, there are bound to be people who respond to this film with cynicism and scorn-people put off by Hartley's abrupt shifts and what they see to be pretentious or mannerist techniques, but who has time to consider the opinions of such dull and callous fools? Anyone who is a Hartley fan will love this film-if they can get a chance to see it, that is. It's hard to say what it would be like on video.\",\n"," \"Not much of a thriller, Juncture is a beautiful drama that also raises questions of moral importance. <br /><br />Lead Kristine Blackport (as Anna Carter) sometimes gives you the shudder. She makes you feel what Anna would feel if were in her place. <br /><br />Plot: Anna Carter is informed by her doctor that she has three months to live because she suffers from frontal-lobe Glioblastoma (a type of brain cancer). Tumors in the frontal lobe can cause changes in personality, thus the question whether her decision to kill child-molesters and other criminals is a matter of choice or of psychiatric nature hangs unanswered. As the plot goes forth, the moral and philosophical issues arising are inevitable, and the surprising end is a statement you can't forget. <br /><br />I liked it very much.\",\n"," 'Words can\\'t begin to describe the admiration that I have for this movie. Even to this day, six years after seeing it for the first time, I can\\'t get over the freshness, originality, and overall boldness of Alex Proyas\\' visionary masterpiece. Now that Proyas is getting a larger budget for I, Robot this year, I felt that it would be time to credit Proyas\\' earlier science fiction masterpiece in anticipation that I, Robot would only live up to this film.<br /><br /> From the opening shots of this film, the viewer is instantly plummeted into a bold and grand setting of an indistinct city that seems that this is how noir films of the forties would look if they were in color. After a display of the bizarre occurrence that happens to the city around midnight, we are introduced to the film\\'s protagonist, a man named John Murdoch, who awakens in a bathtub, with no memory of his life or how he got where he was. Needless to say, what happened to the dead woman next to his bed. After a few clues that seem to trigger brief glimpses of his childhood, he is chased from his room by three odd looking figures, looking for him.<br /><br />As Murdoch wanders the city, trying to find his identity, we learn that not only are the strange people (who are appropriately named The Strangers) looking for Mr. Murdoch, but a police officer named Bumstead is as well, searching for the killer of not just the woman in the apartment, but six other women who were murdered in the same manner as the woman from Murdoch\\'s room. Also is Murdoch\\'s estranged wife, who is trying to make a reconciliation with him after a falling out. Even a therapist that Murdoch has been seeing because of his wife\\'s infidelity is searching for him as well. Everyone seems to have their own reason to be searching for Murdoch, and Murdoch is trying to figure out why, since he has no clue as to who he is. In a sense, Murdoch\\'s quest becomes a search for identity in a world that is trying to label him. Is he a murderer, is he a jilted lover, is he psychologically damaged person, or is he a like the strangers who are pursuing him?<br /><br />But that becomes the center question of Dark City itself, do we make up who we are or are we made up of experiences and memories? We realize this question when we realize the purpose of the Strangers\\' inhabitance of the city. They are actually aliens, whose race is dying out and they need to observe the human race to see what has made us thrive so much. So, we enter their experiment, which revolves around making the inhabitants of the city fall asleep at midnight while the strangers give them new lives by implanting new memories in them and changing the environment around them.<br /><br />Murdoch also discovers that the reason the Strangers are coming after him is because he has developed an immunity to the experiment, not falling asleep when everyone else does. He has also begun to take on the traits of the strangers as well, gaining their power to \"tune\", which is the ability to alter their environment by will alone. This whole concept suggests two things, the first being that humanity has the ability to adapt and thrive in a new environment and the other is that as an individual, humans have the ability to shape their world to their own desire once they are fully aware of themselves and their desires.<br /><br />The movie in itself is a brilliant commentary on our society as a whole which is displayed in the beginning with Dr. Schreber\\'s rat experiment in the lab, which comes to symbolize a smaller scale version of the strangers\\' experiment for us, putting rats (humans) in a maze of a city (life) and seeing if they can find their way. Which also seems to suggest that as a society, we are merely just rats in a maze, wandering around until we come to the end. The strangers\\' insistence on doing everything as a group also brings up another interesting point about the human race is that our ability to be individuals is what makes humans thrive rather than conformity and similarity. \"Dark City\" takes such bold and brilliant concepts, suggesting so much about our society as a whole and even the importance of individuality over conformity. The themes, once read into, take on such a strong and complex turn, unheard of in most science fiction films of recent years.<br /><br />Then there is the matter of the setting itself, for no science fiction film can be complete without a strong and symbolic setting. The setting is vast and detailed, and this isn\\'t just the city, which is a sight to behold in itself. The underground world of the strangers themselves is claustrophobic, atmospheric, and actually is the most alien in architecture, suggesting a twisted, surrealistic world, yet one that is dependent on the world above them. The city above ground displays a rich noir feel in which one feels that there is something sinister lurking underneath it\\'s surface. Even the blending of the time periods, seeing 30s architecture around 60s cars driven by people in 50s suits is even a hint off that the city has been fabricated out of different eras and pasts as one of the strangers even seems to suggest.<br /><br />\"Dark City\" is a film rich in ideas, concepts, visual splendor, and atmosphere. It\\'s the kind of film that one seems to enjoy being lost in, despite the danger that lurks in it\\'s atmosphere. It\\'s a film that reassures it\\'s viewers that a strong understanding of oneself and staying true to yourself that one can conquer any world they are placed in. And as I, Robot approaches, one can only hope that lightning can strike twice with Proyas and his unique blend of visual grandeur and his depth will emerge and be embraced by a larger audience, who might seek out this film.',\n"," 'Just want to inform you guys that this movie was actually pretty good !!! <br /><br />Thought it was a lame ass movie, but not at all, many moments in this movie wore pretty horrifying. <br /><br />This movie has enough blood, gore, and some sexy make out scenes of course, to keep any horror buff like me 100% satisfied!

I do not need to remind people of how terrible Hollow Man turned out to be. But this direct-to-video sequel, Hollow Man II, directed by Claudio Faeh and executive produced by Verhoeven, is actually really good. So good in fact that I am looking forward to the third installment of the franchise. The special effects, production value, performances and storyline are just as good if not better than most high-budget theatrical studio films. Christian Slater makes a great bad guy but what I enjoyed most was Peter Facinelli as the hero. Who knew -- Peter is a great action hero. This is by far the best direct-to-video horror/thriller film that I have seen in a long time. It makes me think that maybe Paul Verhoeven should hang up his hat as a director and oversee the sequels to his better films, Robocop, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers. There is no argument that those franchises need as much help as they can get.',\n"," \"Marlene Gorris has established herself as one of the world's great directors.

Well worth seeing.\",\n"," \"Believe me I wanted this series to work, but the early departure of Kevin Kilner dealt a near death blow after season one. Robert Leeshock just wasn't right for the part and Jane Heitmeyer did an admirable job as lead but the series just got too messy and confused at that point. I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess. Sometimes its time to drop the red cape and just stick the sword in the bull, if you know what I mean. The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict. If not for their talents and well-written dialogue they would have been two weird bald man-chicks in a B-movie series.<br /><br />If only this series could have ended at season 4 and picked up later by SyFy...\",\n"," 'THe film was overly sentimental and over dramatic. Moreover, in spite of the lavish attention to period baseball with the appearance of CGI stadiums along with period uniforms and gloves, it seems to me that they failed to understand a simple fact of baseball. In the final game of the World Series, played in Detroit, the main character, Joe, runs out on the field to play defense for the visiting Pittsburgh Pirates to start the game. The visiting team always bats first and the home team takes the field first. A gross error of judgment. I also agree with the other poster about the huge numbers of homers and long balls being out of place in the game of that era.',\n"," 'One of the greatest westerns of all time! But this one, unlike many others, does not deal with the nature, horses, shootouts, etc., but instead deals with one rifle, the Winchester \\'73, and how this one rifle effects others and how they effect it. A rifle is not a living, breathing, human being, right? You may be inclined to believe that it is not. But it seems to have a mind of its own, for two very similar reasons: it gets back to its rightful owner in the end, even though that throughout the rest of the picture, its unthoughtful \"owners\" do their best to make sure it does not, and it never seems to be content until it gets back to its original owner, so, coincidentally, the unthoughtful \"owners\" always seem to lose it somehow or get killed trying to protect and keep it, until it gets back to James Stewart, then it is \"content\". But, not every one of the owners deserves to have it. Stewart does, of course, since he won it. McNally does not, since he had to be a dirty thief and steal it. Drake definitely does not, because he would probably lose it in some poker game, and besides, Drake is too cowardly to fight, so why should he have a one-of-a-kind rifle if he will not even use it? Duryea does not, because he is just a chuckling maniac, and we all know that chuckling maniacs do not deserve guns. This film has a sort of noir edge that only Westerns can have, such as the Ox-Bow Incident. Westerns have their own type of noir, much different than the 30\\'s and 40\\'s Bogart films. It is, hands-down, the best one out of all five Stewart-Mann westerns, even though my personal favorite is \"Bend of the River\". The other four became much different than this one. I do not think it a coincidence to see that the other four were color, and this is black and white. This is because of the noir edge. All five films had the revenge and the dark past on Stewart\\'s part play into the film, to the point where this is not just Stewart\\'s dark side, but also actually a sort of character, not one to be listed in the credits, but one that you can only recognize and know that it is there, always present. However, this one, not just on revenge and the dark past, but also in terms of supreme danger, and characters that were very different than Stewart make it surpass the other four in all aspects. But Stewart never crosses the line. He does, however, walk the line between light and dark. This is why black and white played such an integral part in the film. They could have all been black and white, or they could have all been color. But this one is in black and white, and the other four are in color, and there is a very good reason for that.',\n"," 'Enhanced by the expressive cinematography of Agnes Godard (Beau Travail), Golden Door is a visually striking tone poem that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island in New York at the turn of the century. It is a surreal, enigmatic, often strange, but ultimately deeply rewarding experience. Interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism, the latest film by Emanuele Crialese (Respiro) is like an impressionistic painting - a cinematic artist\\'s rendering of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents. Crialese\\'s \"magical, mystery tour\" came about as a result of his visit to the museum on Ellis Island, the looks on the faces of the immigrants depicted in photographs he saw, and his research into the harsh policies and procedures used during the admission of immigrants.<br /><br />Guided by letters he read of immigrants sent to relatives who remained at home, Crialese identifies with those impoverished immigrants who were able to see the positive side of things beyond their ordeal. To Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato) and his older son Angelo (Francesco Casisa), America is a distant dream that they know nothing about. After climbing a rocky mountain to pray to the saints for a sign, they are rewarded when they are shown post cards by Salvatore\\'s younger son, Pietro (Filippo Pucillo), a deaf mute, that depict the new world as a land where they can bathe in rivers of milk, sit under a money tree, or harvest giant onions and carrots.<br /><br />After disposing of their animals in exchange for shoes and suits, Salvatore, his two sons, and his elderly mother Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) set out on their adventure with more hope than trepidation but the equation soon shifts the other way. As they board the boat and settle into their crowded third-class steerage compartments, the most-talked about scene in the film takes place. Using an overhead camera that shows masses of people standing, as the ship pulls away, the frame is divided into those aboard the ship and those waving goodbye from the dock and the way they are separated implies they are being torn asunder from everything familiar.<br /><br />Aboard the ship is a mysterious English woman named Lucy (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Crialese does not reveal her past or the reason she is traveling to America but she seems to stand for the onset of the modern world they are entering. Though they eye each other cautiously, Lucy becomes interested in Salvatore and asks him to marry her in order to allow her to enter the country. The voyage is treacherous with a violent storm buffeting the ship. Shot in almost complete darkness, passengers in steerage are tossed against the side of the boat and, afterward, bodies lie tangled and twisted on the floor as if in a macabre Totentanz. The rite of passage through immigration processing at Ellis Island does not become any easier and Crialese attacks the way illiterate peasants, in the name of preserving \"civilized\" society, are forced to put puzzles together, perform mathematical tasks, and undergo humiliating medical examinations to prove they are \"fit\".<br /><br />A marriage brokering ceremony feels like an auction block and the young women look despondent when they are matched with overweight middle-aged men. This is the only way they can enter the \"Golden Door\", however, since single women are rejected unless they have partners, ostensibly to prevent the threat of prostitution. Through the fog the immigrant\\'s can barely see the land of milk and honey and there is no Statue of Liberty asking for the tired and the poor, the humbled masses yearning to breathe free. In their imagination, however, the river is still flowing, waiting for them to jump in. Though the ending is ambiguous and one door opens on to a blank wall, another door symbolizes a rebirth of the soul and the passage we must all take from the old world to the new.',\n"," 'Of all the made for TV Disney movies that came out recently, this is one of the best.

LAUGHING GRAVY was essentially the same plot except that Stan and Ollie were trying to hide a cute puppy from their grouchy landlord--not a goat like in ANGORA LOVE. This whole goat angle is the worst part of the film. While you could understand the boys wanting to keep a cute little dog (after all, it is snowy outside), why exactly they bring a goat home is just contrived and pointless. According to the plot, the goat followed them home and so they got tired of shooing it away and kept it. Huh?!

With her bland suits and superfluous hair gel, Young does a decent job at convincing the audience of her devout hatred for men. Why else would she ask her only friend to pose as a prostitute just so she can arrest cops who try to pick up on them? This hatred is also the only reason why she relentlessly pursues a perverted photographer who gives women a consensual thrill and the driving force behind this crappy movie.

After, the cartoons and the description of the guys\\' life with pictures made me think I had made the right choice.<br /><br />Then, seeing the hilarious fake look of Toronto was cool. Also, the situation and appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first idea.<br /><br />That was maybe the first 10 minutes of the movie... which afterwards looked like an eternity.<br /><br />Maybe that\\'s just me not understanding English Canadian humour (that\\'s possible, English Canadians also do not always understand Quebecois humour), but hey... there was enough stuff in that for a short movie, *nothing* more. Maybe that could be a meaning for the title? Anyway, almost everything was filling, and very few things were even close to funny in my opinion.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, the \"making of\" was better than the movie. At least you understand the motivation behind that which made everything bad. The potential of the idea was great; that\\'s why I rented the movie, being interested in the \"annoying people disappearance\" thing. But yet, I did not know the whole universe would vanish, and with it even a point to the movie.<br /><br />If you are English Canadian, it seems you could appreciate the local humour, considering the surprising number of people who gave this movie an 8.

I think Jordana Brewster should have received an Emmy nomination for her real and natural performance. Many of us who were Phoebe's age at this time the story takes place will understand how real it is. Life for most of us is neither softly glowing romantic or harshly cynical pessimism. It is a blurred balance, and this film captures this balance. It is well constructed, too, with so many fine details in its composition. Like the film or not, judging from the extraordinarily high ratings it gets from the demographic of females under 18, we can know that this movie reveals some important truth about how young women see themselves in the world.\",\n"," \"Kazan's early film noir won an Oscar. Some of the reviews here go into extraordinary detail and length about the film and its symbolism, and rate it very highly. I can almost see where they are coming from. But I prefer to take a more toned-down approach to a long-forgotten film that appears to have been shot on practically no budget and in quasi-documentary fashion. Pneumonic plague is loose in the streets of New Orleans, and it is up to a military doctor (Widmark) and a city detective (Douglas) to apprehend the main carrier (Palance). The film is moody, shot in stark black and white, and makes very good use of locations. Widmark is wonderful as usual. Forget the symbolism (crime equals disease, and disease equals crime) and just enjoy the chase. It is not always easy watching a film like this now that we are well into this new century, as it is of a particular style that was very short-lived (post WWII through the early 1950s) and will unlikely be of interest to the casual film watcher. For those who will be watching this for the first time, sit tight for the big chase at the end. It is something else, and frankly I don't know how they filmed some of it. I can say it probably took as long to film the finale as it did the first 90 percent of the movie.\",\n"," '\"Visitor Q\" is a failed attempt at black comedy which focuses on what might be the world\\'s most dysfunctional family including physical abuse from beatings to murder to incest to sodomy to necrophilia to a lactating mom who nurses her husband and adult daughter, etc. The film is so outrageous it garnered some critical praise and established a small cult following.

Mr Perks,like many working people of his time,will have nothing to do with anything that he considers smacks of \"charity\" and it is a key moment in the movie when he finally accepts that birthday gifts he has been given by the children do not compromise his principles. Although the lovely Miss Agutter has received all the accolades it is Mr Cribbins and Miss Sheridan whose performances dominate \"The Railway Children\".They both know how Edwardian society works from opposite ends of the spectrum but there is an unspoken mutual respect and understanding between them. But this is basically a movie about family.In an era when a mother can kidnap her own daughter and hold her to ransom and be considered as \"socially inept\" rather than unfit to live in decent society,and when two \"human beings\" can beat and kick a baby to death without being charged with murder,\"family\" may be seen as an old - fashioned,elitist, racist even homophobic concept,but a century ago it was the glue that held society together at all levels.Mr Cribbins\\' and Miss Sheridan\\'s families are archetypal for the age.Strong and loving,sticking together against outside influences,integral units with a moral certainty mocked in the 21st century. What might seem to be a dull,preachy political tract is turned by Mr Lionel Jeffries into a delightful hymn to hope,faith,optimism and courage.

I thought because it was released in the same year as two other very well regarded British horror movies , one featuring a squad of British soldiers as good guys fighting a bunch of werewolves and the other featuring a squad of British soldiers as bad guys battling against crypto zombies , that LONG TIME DEAD may have got lost in the market place but after finally seeing it I doubt if the merits of DOG SOLDIERS and 28 DAYS LATER had anything to do with its failure - The reason it bombed is that it's a rather poor horror movie<br /><br />First of all can we please stop seeing movies where horny , drug taking teenagers get stalked and slashed . I had become very fed up by this plot by the early 1980s and it stopped being a good premise 20 years ago . Okay SCREAM and FINAL DESTINATION used the same plot but the producers at least tried to do something a little bit different with the plot where as in this movie it's just well worn cliché as is the set up with a ouija board<br /><br />Okay I'm in a generous mood so I won't put the boot into director because it's a debut and I imagine Marcus Adams had a lot of enjoyment shooting the picture and it is fairly stylish . I should also point out that there is a not unimpressive sequence where two characters enter a house only for them to come to a sticky end . Unfortunately Mr Adams also wrote the screenplay and it's this that is the film's undoing <br /><br />I'm not much of a horror fan and though I enjoyed the 2002 releases where the British Army let off a few shots at monsters in abandoned houses there's little in this movie to recommend unless you're a horror movie addict\",\n"," \"Broadway and film actor-turned-director John Cassavetes (from Rosemary's Baby)creates a masterpiece with this 1977 film. It stars Gena Rowlands, John Cassavetes himself, Ben Gazzara, Joan Blondell, Paul Stewart, Zohra Lampert, Laura Johnson and there is a cameo by Peter Falk. The premise of the film: An aging stage and film actress (Gena Rowlands)re-evaluates her life after an obscessed fan dies in a car accident trying to get her autograph. The movie has a slow pace and a dark, moody, frightening quality. It has a 60's cinematic look and it even reminded me of Polanski's Rosemary's Baby without the supernatural horror. The fears here are the ones every successful actress has- she is getting old and she will become useless in her career. Furthermore, she feels she has lived a life that lacks any true spirituality, humanity and merit. She has lived only for her career- she has no children, doesn't do charitable deeds, etc. The gradual disintegration of her personality is the meat of this film. She is falling apart. She's in a crisis. Gena Rowlands really gets into the character's tormented psyche and acts the part quite well. She is a terrific actress and this 70's film is a refreshing contrast to the often violent films of the period and or the disaster movies or adventure thrillers. It's a movie with lots of deep-seated emotion but has a cold, cynical feeling, as if Cassavetes is criticizing the mainstream movies and actors of the 70's generation. Either that or this movie is a product of the 70's which was itself cynical in many aspects- Nixon's deception, Watergate, Vietnam, etc. Although the production values are not great, and this film is not well-known, it's a very haunting film with haunting moods. Kudos to the underrated and late director Cassavetes who died in the late 80's.\",\n"," \"I was in college when JANE visited Vietnam; I thought her actions were disloyal to the United States, and to the men & women fighting in SE Asia against communism.

Before anyone gets excited, the DVD set I received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their TV 15 years ago. The resolution and quality are poor. The images look like you would expect old re-recorded video to look. Although the commercials were edited out, the ending credits of each episode still have voice-over announcements for the segway into the ABC news program \"Nightline\", complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990\\'s. Even with the poor image quality, the shows were watch-able and the sound quality was fine.<br /><br />To this show\\'s credit, the casting was nearly perfect. Everyone was believable and really looked the part. Their acting was also above average. The role of Jeff Metcalf is played particularly well by Kyle Chandler (most recently seen in the 2005 remake of King Kong). The period costumes were very authentic as were the sets, especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and décor. The direction was also creative and different for a TV show at that time. For example, conversations between characters were sometimes inter-cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes. The dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations. That takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case.<br /><br />As I started watching this series again I suddenly remembered why I lost interest in it 15 years ago. Despite all the ingredients for a fine show, the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start. For one thing, the name of the show itself is totally misleading. When WWII ended in 1945, there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a \"homefront\" either. Curiously, the first episode of the show \"Homefront\" begins in 1945 after the war had ended. That\\'s like shooting the first episode of \"Gilligan\\'s Island\" showing the castaways being rescued. The whole premise of the show\\'s namesake is completely lost. I still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no, the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948. Additionally, this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940\\'s. By the third episode, it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left-wing political agenda. The show is set in River Run Ohio, near Toledo. However, the show\\'s ongoing racism theme makes it look more like Jackson Mississippi than Ohio. Part of the ensemble cast are Dick Williams, Hattie Winston and Sterling Macer Jr. who portray the Davis family. Much of the series shows the Davis family being discriminated against by the evil \"whites\" to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable. The racism card has been played and over played by Hollywood now for over 40 years. We get it. We\\'re also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis. The subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show, as it was for \"Homefront\". The acting talents of Williams, Winston and Macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical \"frightened / angry black family\". The wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in Ohio was a KKK member or something. The racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist-fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing, and leave it at that. Devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid.<br /><br />In yet another ridiculous plot line, the big boss of a local factory (Ken Jenkins) is portrayed as an Ebenezer Scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees. The workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro-communist propaganda message to the viewer.<br /><br />Personally, I think this series had great potential. The writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941 \\x96 1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories. Of course the loss of brothers, sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama. The situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or USO personnel passing through their town during training or en-route to Europe or the Pacific. The possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless. But no, the writers of Homefront (David Assael and James Grissom) completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots. Instead, they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left-wing politics. It would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage.',\n"," \"the hills have eyes is not a great film by any stretch of the imagination.for one the villains look almost normal,not what you would expect deranged lunatics to look like.for another the pacing is very slow at times and there are many scenes of the characters repeating themselves.by that,i mean there is a lot of filler in the movie, with a lot of running around aimlessly.the film didn't have a clear direction.the plot of the movie is hardly original,even for its time.the Texas chainsaw massacre came out a few year earlier and is a much more effective film, as far as horror goes.the film has little in the way of scares, and the pounding soundtrack just served to be both grating and distracting all at once.i suppose the music was used to cover up the fact that not much happens through much of the movie, though it failed in its intended purpose.i basically kept looking at the time every few seconds hoping something would happen or it would end .when something finally did happen any promise the film had was ruined by mere chaos and loud noise.i sat through it because i like to give a film the benefit of the doubt.yes, there is some loud screaming,and yes people die,but who cares.much too slow getting to any sort of pay off,if you can call it that.my buddy enjoyed it, so at least one of us got something out of it.the hills have eyes isn't the worst film we could have watched, but i doubt i will watch it again.this film was remade in 2006 and i will also have review of that version.anyway, this movie was painfully slow at times, while other times was chaotic and repetitive.unless you like watching paint dry, occasionally interspersed with someone running around your block, screaming their head off, stay away from this movie.a better bet would be the original Texas chainsaw massacre(1973)1.5* out of 10* which is being generous\",\n"," '...that utterly fails to live up to its quirky progenitor, \"From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money\" is only worth the time spent watching it to vampire geeks, of whom only the most indiscriminate will be pleased, and/or Tarantino/Rodriguez completists, who will remain bemused as to whether or not these renowned auteurs even bothered to read writer/director Scott \"Evil Dead 2\" Spiegel\\'s script before bankrolling this mess.

Gruenberg is best known -- if you can call it that -- for his opera \"The Emperor Jones\", based on the O\\'Neill play.

It should surface again soon though; they\\'re running out of potentially marketable operas to revive.<br /><br />Opera seems an appropriate subject to mention here since Charles Boyer\\'s character operates under his \"Czech\" aliases. Two of them are \"Wozzeck\" and \"Gunther\", both prominent roles in German opera. Is that just coincidence?<br /><br />Name-dropping just seems to be part of this film.

Val Kilmer while being billed as one of the main people in this film, is in the movie for about 2 minutes. Even the summary on the back of the DVD is not entirely true. This could have been a good movie but the direction was horrible and the plot was about as thin as a sheet of paper. Usually when a movie is this horrendous you can sit back and laugh at it.

The final fight sequence changed all that: it is long and good and intense - indeed, one of the highlights of Chan\\'s career. But to get to it, you have to sit through a lot of \"comedy\" that might amuse five-year-olds (oh, look! someone threw a tomato at that guy\\'s face) and endless \"football\" scenes. Not to mention the dubbing (which includes the line \"How can I turn it off? It\\'s not a tap\" - watch to find out what it refers to). \"Dragon Lord\" is worth renting for the final fight alone, but the rest of the movie is only for Jackie collectors, and even then only for those who\\'ve already seen at least 15 of his other movies.

After a large drug dose kills her her two kids are taken into care & her creepy ventriloquist dummy imaginatively named Dummy locked away in a suitcase. Jump forward to the present & now the teenage Angelina (Paydin LaPachin) & her mute brother Norbert (Rocky Marquette) decide to head back to Las Vegas after going from foster home to foster home with Dummy to find the fame & fortune as a ventriloquist act their late poor mother never did. The trip will not be easy & sacrifices need to be made along the way, cars need to be stolen & anyone who gets in their way must be killed. Angelina also wants to continue the family bloodline so kidnaps a teenage girl (Katie Chonacas) for Norbert to rape & impregnate. With the cops hot on their tail will they find the success & happiness they crave?<br /><br />Retitled to simply Dummy (which was apparently the films original working title) here in the UK this was written & directed by Mark Jones the man responsible for starting the Leprechaun (1993) franchise (gee, thanks a million mate...) & I have to say that I thought Triloquist was rubbish & there's not a lot else to add although i will attempt to try & explain why I am of that opinion. The first thing to say about Triloquist is that it's a horror comedy with heavy emphasis on the comedy, unfortunately it's not funny in the slightest which is obviously a big problem. There's plenty of swearing & some may find the very innocent looking Angelina talk dirty amusing but I am sure they will be in the minority. There are a few visual gags like the dummy Dummy having a dream in which topless strippers caress & kiss him but these come across as childish, immature & quite frankly desperate. The one-liners suck & I seriously doubt many viewers will find anything in Triloquist funny, I certainly didn't. Then there's the rubbish story which makes you feel like you didn't even watch a proper film, there is one of the worst twist endings I have ever seen that makes absolutely zero sense & in context with the rest of the film doesn't work as there are clear contradictions & plot holes. It's never explained quite what Dummy is or who is controlling him & the twist only adds to the confusing & some might say frustration. To be fair to Triloquist the film moves along like a rocket & there are few dull moments but with such a bad story, such unfunny jokes & gags which miss by the proverbial mile & an extremely unlikable central character it's still an incredibly difficult film to either like or enjoy.<br /><br />Basically a bad taste road film as we see Angelina, Norbert & Dummy murder their way across America stealing whatever car they fancy along the way there's not even that much gore in it. There are a few severed fingers, a neck wound & a bit of blood splatter which amounts to just about nothing. There's some nudity as well as a few topless girls are seen. There are no scares, there's no atmosphere & a really flat visual style that grows old very quickly. I also have to mention the soundtrack which I found extremely annoying & some of the songs used gave me a headache.<br /><br />Although Triloquist is reasonably well made it has no style & looks both dull & bland. The editing is also poor on occasion with some scenes not making any sense & character's suddenly popping up from quite literally nowhere. The acting isn't great although Paydin LaPachin is a real looker but not enough of a looker to make Triloquist worth watching.<br /><br />Triloquist, or Dummy if you live here in the UK, is crap by any name & I think it's as simple & straight forward as that really. It's not funny, it's not scary or gory & it's definitely not clever with a terrible twist that insults the viewer.\",\n"," \"...as MOST of the very very unjustified and critical reviews about Loose Change SE are from people who only wrote ONE comment on IMDb; to tell us that this movie is rubbish because it's facts are wrong.<br /><br />Yeah, right.<br /><br />I liked this movie because someone has to dare to produce such stuff. It is highly entertaining as well. And it will make us rethink about what we behold as true.

We\\'ve got here a Satanic cult which can: 1) \"beam away\" people (like in \"Star Trek\"), 2) kill through little children\\'s dolls, 3) transfer a soul from one body into another, 4) hypnotize telepathically from a bigger distance, and 5) cause drastic car-crashes in which selected persons turn into spaghetti while others (kids, in this case) survive unscathed.<br /><br />On the other hand, the forces of \"good\" can: 1) sit around helplessly, 2) stand around cluelessly, 3) panic, 4) laugh hysterically, 5) waste time by doing nothing, 6) read comics while people get slaughtered by the dozens, and 7) arrive too late to Satanic rituals.<br /><br />In every religious horror movie I have to assume that that movie\\'s world is inhabited by God and by Satan. I also have to assume that Satan can\\'t be 1,000,000 times more powerful, unless the movie has a world order resembling that of Hell. In other words, where were the priests in this film who knew something? The best that this movie\\'s priest could do is guess that there are some witches about - nothing else - from reading all those books in his study. At the first sight of violence this priest becomes catatonic, then laughs hysterically, only to finish in a major panic attack. So this is supposed to be God\\'s contribution to fighting Satan? Ridiculous. Every good religious horror film has the powers of \"good\" equipped with some form of (more-or-less) supernatural power, or at least SOME concrete knowledge of how to fight \"evil\". In that sense this movie is quite idiotic. As is the casting of the droll Martin to play the high priest(!) of the cult. There is very little menace or awe in watching the quirky Martin lead a Satanic ritual. I mean, it didn\\'t have to be Christopher Lee or Langhella, but couldn\\'t they have found someone less funny-looking?

He said it was just some screwed up Japanese movie, but I saw so much more of it. It's badly made, yes, but it has a certain type of poignancy as to be beautiful, too.

So what happened when the novel became a made-for-television movie? Perhaps it is the below mediocre screenplay (oops!, teleplay!) by John Pielmeier that consistently galumphs along in an awkward pedestrian fashion removing all sense of credibility to the story. Perhaps it is the cut and paste direction by Mick Jackson that misses the pacing and character delineation. Perhaps it suffers from the cinematography of an uncredited source or the 'liquid tears' musical score by Daniel Licht. For whatever of these (or all of these) reasons, this novel-to-film survives because it does make a good case for educating the public about the capabilities of those born with Down Syndrome. And for that it is worthy of attention. <br /><br />Dr. David Henry (Dermot Mulroney), a successful orthopedic doctor, is married to the beautiful Norah (Gretchen Mol) and their lives are becoming changed by their pregnancy. On a stormy winter night in Kentucky Norah goes into labor and the Henry's rush to a nearby clinic where David delivers his wife (the doctor is caught in a snowstorm) with the assistance of his old friend, nurse Caroline Gill (Emily Watson). After the delivery of a perfect boy child (Paul) Norah continues to be in labor and (surprisingly...) delivers an unexpected (!) twin girl. David and Caroline immediately recognize that the little girl (Phoebe) is a 'mongoloid' (this is before the use of the term Down Syndrome) and David, having a history of losing a little sister because of a birth defect) decides to send Phoebe to an asylum for the mentally challenged: Caroline is to make the delivery and Norah is told the second twin died at birth. <br /><br />Caroline follows instructions, sees the conditions of the 'home' where Phoebe is to be deposited, shrinks in horror, and decides to keep the child. Aided by a friendly trucker, Caroline changes her solitary existence and mothers Phoebe, finding a new life in her trucker's Pittsburgh. Norah insists on a formal funeral for Phoebe - a fact that deeply disturbs David's psyche, and the Henry's life goes on with only the one child Paul, leaving submerged pains about the lack of Phoebe's presence. Norah gifts David with a camera ('peoples lives are like a camera, that's where they live - in a room captured by a moment') and David becomes obsessed with photography. Norah grieves, drinks, and loses David's attention, while David traces Phoebe's existence with Caroline - sending money and letters to Pittsburgh. Paul (Tyler Stentiford to Jamie Spilchuk) grows up, discovers his mother's infidelities and is angered about his father's lack of communication and understanding, and decides to fulfill his goal of becoming a musician, and off to Juilliard he goes. Meanwhile Phoebe (Krystal Hope Nausbaum) has matured into a very highly adapted young girl, and the manner in which the broken marriage of the Henrys happens and the healing atmosphere of Phoebe's and Paul's lives coupled with the courage that has supported Caroline Gill's struggle to gain acceptance in the world for those born with Down Syndrome forms the conclusion of the film. <br /><br />The cast of well-known actors tries hard, but only Emily Watson is able to resurrect a credible character from this squishy script. Jamie Spilchuk gives evidence of a young actor with much promise. Dermot Mulroney and Gretchen find it difficult to mold empathetic characters form the corny lines they are given to deliver. The film is a mess, but the message about acceptance of Down Syndrome children and adults is an important one.

It seems like all the bad indie films in the past 10 years have used the same formula: several opposing groups fighting each other over money. This film is no different than the rest, except for the fact that it may be worse.<br /><br />In one scene, the two lead actresses are being chased by a biker gang. But I guess the production couldn't afford actual Harleys so dirt bikes were used instead. A dirt bike gang wearing full leather and hitting the bars? Hahahaha!

Although this film is only 71 minutes in length, it feels more like three hours. Sure there\\'s some half-decent stop-motion animated monsters but they are particularly disappointing in comparison to other stop-motion efforts of the era and the stock footage used from STANLEY AND LIVINGSTONE (1939) perks things up slightly as well towards the end but aside from those short moments of excitement, well there\\'s lots and lots of walking.

However, it soon becomes apparent that this is a largely pointless film that isn't going to go anywhere. Clearly nobody would go into this expecting much more, but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying when you consider that it's also rather dull and none of the characters are interesting. As the title suggests, the film focuses on a 'rogue'; in this case one that steals, womanises and smuggles stuff. That's basically all the plot that this movie has. The film does have a real 'seventies style' to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well. It sometimes seems like directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson were trying to put across some sort of point, although whatever that point is doesn't come across very well. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on screen is always a pleasure, and that is the case here too; she's definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film. Overall, The Rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love the seventies style, but unfortunately it doesn't have much else to offer.\",\n"," \"This movie is hilarious.

Sherman (producer) and Al Adamson (director) corral several actors they\\'ve worked with before, including Taylor, Adamsons\\' sexy wife Regina Carrol, Angelo Rossitto, Zandor Vorkov, and Vicki Volante. They tried to go for the feel of the previous \"Blood Island\" entries but one can tell this was made stateside.

A malevolent dwarf (Rossitto), gory operations, a rather unconvincing makeup job on Bloom, the political intrigue subplot, caverns full of cobwebs, etc. The narrative is actually pretty coherent, with plot twists thrown in here and there. I think it could have been trimmed a bit; some scenes drag. But it\\'s got its fun moments and an ending people might not expect.<br /><br />For this kind of thing, the acting isn\\'t too bad.

But the plot meanders, development stagnates where it should\\'ve been moving forward (right around the middle, to be precise), and as for the ending...it almost felt as if they had run out of ideas so they suddenly said, \"Hey, let\\'s just film a last scene real quick, put some sentimental string soundtrack over it, and end it that way.\" Even Amanda Seyfried\\'s beauty could not save this. Channing Tatum too gave a good performance, but you can only do so much with a flawed script.<br /><br />Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy. From the smokey voiced, irritatingly high-pitched female folk singer schtick (surely chosen to appeal to the majority of college-age girls that will go see this movie) to the overused \"shimmering strings and piano\" combo, it only annoys anyone paying more attention to the film as a whole rather than to his own \"feelings.\" The film has a good beginning and the major conflict that launches us into the second act were all promising. So was part of the second act itself, as the story unfolded. Then the film just dropped the ball. Beyond that, I\\'d have to give spoilers.<br /><br />\"Dear John\" is not a bad movie, but it doesn\\'t work as it should either.

A strange situation and hopefully my positive review will point people towards this old and mostly forgotten Anime movie. Space cobra is the funky tale of a smuggler and rogue who becomes involved with the three sisters of an ancient and dead planet and an evil force who wants to harness the planets powers. This is an old movie and the animation shows, but what it lacks in modern sophistication it makes up with an abundance of charm. Space Cobra is very much geared to a western audience and very easy to watch. There are few if any references to specific Japanese culture and great for Anime novices to watch and enjoy. Space Cobra himself is witty and likable. I cannot say how much of this is due to the English dub or the intentions of the maker, but this is one of the few Japanese comedy characters that I find truly funny. The style is very sixties Barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by Yello. The style is colourful and imaginative and there is constant action to move the story along. The strangest aspect of this movie is how it begins as a comedy and ends on a very downbeat dramatic note. I cannot think of another Anime or general movie that has been able to do this so seamlessly and convincingly. You barely realise that it is happening, but it is done so subtly and seems perfectly natural. You also really feel the characters went on a journey and they're lives were changed by the whole experience.

The man and woman had been lovers, but the captain attempted to break off the relation when she discovered her boy friend was married. He continued to stalk her, going so far as to fire his side arm in her direction at one time. Finally he broke into her home, attacked her with a knife, and was shot twice with her service pistol and killed. The civilian prosecutor ruled the killing self defense, but the Marines decided to charge the captain with murder. The major, you see, was a decorated hero from Vietnam, and an old friend of the commanding colonel at the Marine base. The captain, too, had made some enemies in her motor pool command, rejecting some male advances in a very butch style.<br /><br />There is considerable psychological freight motivating and controlling the actions of the principal participants in this drama, which the very capable cast gets across nicely.

Sure, \"war is hell\", but sometimes it can\\'t be avoided. We\\'ll need those Marines then, even if they aren\\'t always the best champions of fair play internally. As Kipling says in his poem \"Tommy Atkins\":<br /><br />\"It\\'s Tommy this and Tommy that, And Tommy wait outside. But, it\\'s room for Mr. Atkins, When the troopship\\'s on the tide.\"',\n"," '\"He Was a Quiet Man\" is perhaps the most original and unpredictable movie I\\'ve ever seen. If you\\'re looking for something \"normal\", you should probably look elsewhere. <br /><br />A story of an extremely lonely, put-upon, disturbed man who desperately wants to be Somebody. Christian Slater plays this man absolutely brilliantly. In watching his performance, I kept thinking \"Where is Christian Slater?\" ... Well, he\\'s not even in the neighborhood. Well done, guy! <br /><br />The direction is absolutely amazing: colorful, imaginative, darkly funny, and surreal. Cubicles, and hummingbirds, and talking fish, oh my! <br /><br />While the film is not particularly emotionally satisfying (to say the least), on the cerebral and aesthetic level, it delivers big time. <br /><br />\"He Was a Quiet Man\" answers the musical question: \"Now maniacs will think twice before going crazy.\" <br /><br />Yessiree.',\n"," 'I have to say that I didn\\'t expect much from this film when I rented it today, but I was really surprised by it.<br /><br />Although the film\\'s story is quite a cliché as is suggested by the back of the DVD case, in my opinion it\\'s done surprisingly good. A pretty conclusive story, except perhaps for the start of it all, not too bad acting and a nice music score form into a decent mystery thriller. I liked how the heroine actually investigates quite a bit throughout the movie instead of just getting the conclusions laid out for her in front of her eyes. Additionally the film doesn\\'t use too many flashy, cheap shock moments and successfully tries to depend more on the mystery itself. And, contrary to the cliché, the heroine doesn\\'t behave exceptionally stupid all the time.<br /><br />On the downside you won\\'t have many surprises coming in the story if you\\'ve seen at least a few mystery thrillers. The ending actually managed to satisfy me, a feat rarely achieved by that genre of movies.<br /><br />If you like mystery thrillers and always thought that those loud, noisy \"in your face\" shock moments are overused you should try this movie.',\n"," 'There are simply times (often many times) when one decides to watch a film merely to enjoy watching a favored actor perform, regardless of the expectations of the film itself. And if the film looks not to be very good, then lowering personal expectations in order to continue to enjoy the film is in order.<br /><br />However, there are also times when one should not make the mistake of confusing the lowering of personal standards in order to enjoy what might not be a very good film, with just plain, out-and-out stupidity.<br /><br />I went mad with joy when I found that English actor Richard Bremmer was going to be in a movie that was actually going to be shown on American television. He is almost exclusively a stage performer. And unfortunately, very little of British television broadcasts or productions can be accessed in the United States, so that usually killed that option for me to be able to see him. <br /><br />I tripped over my feet, running to park myself in front of my TV.<br /><br />It served me right.<br /><br />I knew full well that there could not possibly be any \"version\" of \"Crime and Punishment\" that could be portrayed in two hours. Even if every word of dialogue were cut and the characters used sandwich boards--it still could not be done. I knew that, so I smirkingly \"lowered my expectations.\" What I should have done was to put my eyes out, stick my fingers in my ears, and have run shrieking out into the night, because THAT would have at least made sense. More so than this movie. <br /><br />I didn\\'t expect a good job of work, far from it. Not in two hours. I didn\\'t expect good writing (I was at least not disappointed) and I did not even expect good acting. Not with the constraints. What I didn\\'t expect, however, was such an intentional and hideous distortion of character of the story\\'s protagonist, Rodya Raskolnikov. Rodya\\'s character was forcibly twisted into a grotesque parody of \"good guy\" in the opening of the story, seemingly so that it could either serve as a vehicle for the young and painfully handsome Patrick Dempsey, or in the assumption that the American audience was too illiterate and stupid not to be able to understand the concept of \"tragedy\".<br /><br />Or possible both.<br /><br />This was an insult both to the story itself and to a fine cast. A lack of direction for Dempsey was apparent, also. He couldn\\'t seem to understand the concept of \"hysteria\", which was the essence of Rodya\\'s personality, and instead resorted to ridiculous movements and twitchings. This was sheer laziness on the part of director Joseph Sargent. He did not take out the time to teach the role to an actor who has a tendency towards being physically hyperactive in much of his work. The film makers took a character who was not a noble character in any way and turned him into nothing more than a clown. <br /><br />Establishing the character of Rodya is the first and foremost thing in any production of \"Crime and Punishment\", no matter how restrained the time or budget might be. He must be established. The book itself is heavily reliant on speech, and there never has been a way to trim it for either a lengthy theatrical film or a television series, neither of which this production was. <br /><br />The point of the novel\\'s story was that Rodya caused unbearable and needless agony and suffering to himself. And that he went into it willingly and with a perverse pleasure. That was a part of the \"crime\" and also a part of the \"punishment.\" He wallowed in his own self-induced emotional pains, and he enjoyed it. He fed on his own agonies. The novel\\'s Rodya was an emotional masochist. He was not the classical figure of Greek tragedy. It is this spot alone where the writer and director failed majestically. <br /><br />If Rodja\\'s character is not established in the beginning of a film, then the entire story collapses and the film can from then on only be a sequence of loosely-stitched together scenes. Even Richard Bremmer and Ben Kingsly, whose incredible performances and clear understanding and interpretations of their respective characters, could not save this film. It was destroyed within the first five minutes. Bremmer and Kingsly are glorious actors and they were wasted in a way I\\'ve never seen. <br /><br />It just didn\\'t play.',\n"," \"This movie, although well shot and superbly acted, was awful. I felt as if I was watching a car accident--sure I kept watching but I really wanted to turn my head. The plot leaves little to be desired, was extremely disjointed, and the ending was abysmal. Although, it did fit the tone of the movie, I was hoping for something to improve this movie. I still don't understand what the references to rabies and the child get bit by the fox at the beginning of the movie. Fifteen minutes of plot that really didn't do much. It's really sad to see a movie with fine actors and a beautiful set wasted on such an awful, awful, story. There's not much more to say about this movie. Save yourself the time and watch c-span. It'll be more uplifting.\",\n"," \"This is a slightly uneven entry with one standout sequence involving an over-the-hill gang reminiscing in the diner that once - thirty years previously - was their hideout; one ho-hum duologue between two ageing rock musos; a noirish kidnap turned on its head and an opening sequence (plus epilogue) involving heist artist wannabe Edward Baer and current 'hot' property Anna Magloulis which has its moments. No movie in which Jean Rochefort appears can be dismissed lightly and here he shines as one of the over-the-hill quintet, indeed the film is worth seeing for Rochefort alone but each of the sequences has something to offer and it's definitely worth a look.\",\n"," \"Legend of Zu is possibly the most exciting movie ive seen in recent years. It transcends all expectations and is truly a work of art. With unmatched visual sceneries and story of divine proportions, Legend of Zu proceeds to blow over its viewers with its majesty. This movie is wonderously crafted through the use of high tech cgi which allows fans of the fantasy genre to see their visions come to life. The acting is perfect for this type of movie; if you were an immortal with supernatural powers I would think you'd keep more to yourself.<br /><br />Unlike the comments of many, the plot is actually quite EASY to follow while maintaining a quick pace that adds a sense of urgency. Anyone that cannot keep track of the different characters simply must not be paying attention since or are used to such levels of sophistication as the titanic. The plot is engaging and layered with themes so epic that they will leave you gasping for air. Legend of Zu is on a level of greatness so high that perhaps many people are put off by its grandeur. Allow yourself to be completely engulfed within its fantastical vision and you will grow to love this movie.\",\n"," 'Forget the other comments above.

I have yet to get tired of this movie. <br /><br />The musical numbers were fantastic!<br /><br />I get chills watching Tiffany Taylor sing \"Here\\'s Where I Stand\" near the end of the film.

Alec Austen is a commercial artist and Naval reservist called to active duty in WWII. Having long forsaken his Quaker upbringing he is thus completely blindsided when after reporting for duty on a destroyer he finds himself seriously conflicted regarding the taking of life. Alan Ladd, though in decline personally and professionally at this point in his life, is, nevertheless, very good as the troubled Alec. This film is further buoyed by an absolutely outstanding supporting cast including: James Whitmore, Keenan Wynn, William Bendix, Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., Jeanette Nolan and Joey Bishop. Other familiar faces include Perry Lopez,(Cowhand Pete Ramirez in THE LONE RANGER movie and a crewman in MR. ROBERTS) and Ross Bagdasarian who, aided by his chipmunks Alvin, Simon & Theodore, would later gain recording and TV fame as David Seville. The storyline is also unique in that the main WWII theater of operations setting is the Northeast Pacific and the Aleutians. Director Rudolph Mate's other credits as Director or Director of Photography include GILDA, SAHARA (1943) and PRIDE OF THE YANKEES. Alas, it has not yet found it's way to DVD.

However, it was just a little bit disappointing in that the 'Twist' was a little too predictable and just a bit too early on in the movie. Whilst watching, it started to get a little bizarre and confusing to the point that, the only reasonable outcome possible was the inevitable plot twist, but it certainly did not ruin this movies flow. There were superb performances, there was never a dull boring moment, so totally well worth watching this one. It kept me interested right up until the end, and for me there isn't many movies that can do that these days. I highly recommend people watch this terrific little movie.\",\n"," \"Enemy at the Gates completely misrepresents the history of the battle and slanders the brave sacrifice of the Soviet people to defeat Nazism. I strongly recommend reading the book 'Enemy at the Gates' to see how little of the movie is true.<br /><br />The story of the sniper is one small story in the book that was complied from hundreds of interviews with veterans from both sides. The story of the sniper was significantly changed for the film from the true story which is much more compelling.<br /><br />All the Generals who actually led the battle are ignored in the film except Kruschev. Kruschev was Political Commissar at the Front level and was involved in the overall planning of the defensive battle and the encirclement of the German 6th army at Stalingrad. He did not command the 62th army in Stalingrad, this was General Chuikov, a true hero. The entire battle was commanded by Marshal Zhukov ( the general who never lost a battle ) in close collaboration with Stalin. After the death of Stalin, Kruschev had his role inflated and Zhukov, Stalin and Chuikov ignored.<br /><br />There is no sense of the battle in the film either at the unit level or overall. The Red Army used firegroups of 25 men armed with bags of grenades and sub machine guns to fight the Germans house to house in the rubble. There was little of the human wave tactics portrayed in the film. Building were fought over room by room and floor by floor. No one went in the open as this was certain death to either side.<br /><br />The battle consisted of the Red army holding on to a tiny corner of the city while the German forces were ground down. When the Germans were weakened, Soviet reserves north and south of the city broke through the weakened flanks off the Nazi forces and surrounded the entire 6th Army and part of the 4th Panzer Army.<br /><br />The 6th Army was Germany's greatest strike force, the same one that conquered France so quickly. At least 330,000 German soldiers from its elite force were killed or captured. Only about 10,000 survived to return to German after the war.<br /><br />Germany never recovered from this loss and it marked to start of their defeat.<br /><br />Please read the book Enemy at the Gates and forget this terrible film\",\n"," 'Now playing is a polo match between \"Movie Stars\" and \"Mickey\\'s Mousers.\" On the stars team is Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, Harpo Marx and Charlie Chaplin.

Great supporting performances by Selleck\\'s manager (\"Japan\\'s Clint Eastwood\"), his girl friend Takanashi, and his interpreter. The chemistry between Selleck and Takanashi works very very well, this is really a very nice romantic movie apart from the baseball.

I dislike computer generated animation anyways, it defeats the purpose of a biopic such as this one. Watch it, you will appreciate it too!\",\n"," \"What a strange film. It begins as a crime thriller and ends up becoming an indictment against war in Africa; in my opinion it is far more successful at the former.<br /><br />An asylum seeker fleeing the fighting in the Congo, gets a job at a security guard in a bank in Eire. He seems a trustworthy sorta fella, however, his wife and child have gone missing in London. When the authorities track them down and grant them all leave to stay, it's seems it will be a happy ending after all. But when an Irish gang kidnap the guy's family in order to get him to cooperate in a little heist they have planned, they don't count on his resilience. As well as a few skeletons he has in the closet that could have them think twice..<br /><br />No-one's behaviour in this film makes any sense! Character's personalities change at the drop of a hat, and seemingly intelligent people make some stupid decisions for no other reason then to add some spice to the plot. Unfortunately this shoddy scriptwriting cripples our interest in the second half of the film, with one 'outrageous' revelation after another resulting in a forced tragic ending.<br /><br />Shame, because the opening scenes are very promising, with Eriq Ebouaney portraying a very sympathetic hero, and Fatou N'Diaye also impressive as his deceptively strong partner. Perhaps the film have been better if the movie had been about their reintegration into a new culture after surviving a traumatic ordeal in a war-torn environment.<br /><br />But no, we get the classic stereotypical gang of chirpy Irish hoodlums, a botched bank raid and then the bloody aftermath, which is where things really come off the rails. There isn't a single event that occurs in the last half an hour that convinces, not one happening that doesn't feel tacked on and absolutely zero elements that aren't stolen from better movies.<br /><br />Just because a film has a humanistic social agenda it doesn't give it the right to be this lacklustre. Someone should have taken the first twenty pages of this script, developed the plot from there are thrown the rest of it on the fire. In my opinion, anyway.

I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard reptilian species. It's funny how the lizards and reptiles are our favorite evil aliens like V but anyway he has three days to program a man who is totally brainwashed in serving the alien species on earth. The stories are usually a little out there but very entertaining to watch.\",\n"," \"There's an old premise that the best storytelling is shown, not told. In terms of the latest Spike Lee Joint, 'She Hate Me,' no truer words have ever been uttered.<br /><br />Jack Armstrong (Anthony Mackie) is a young vice-president of a pharmaceutical company on the verge of unveiling a vaccine for HIV, pending FDA approval. Through the nefarious actions of greedy senior executives, Jack finds himself pegged as the scapegoat for this drug that ultimately will not be approved and the subsequent tumble in company stock. Think Enron, Worldcom, et al. but Spike won't let you think for yourself, as he keeps their specific names prominently displayed throughout the movie with overt and pointed references. Margo (Ellen Barkin) who looked eerily like Martha Stewart only further illustrates this point.<br /><br />In a scenario reminiscent of 'Enemy of the State,' Jack loses access to all of his finances and is 'forced' to consider alternative means of generating income. After an unexpected visit by his former fiancée he accepts her offer to become father of her child\\x85her child and her lesbian lover's child.<br /><br />$10,000 for 2 successful impregnations is the deal and Jack 'reluctantly' accepts. The next thing you know, he has lesbian women knocking at his door daily, five at a time, offering $10,000 each per impregnation.<br /><br />If you've ever seen a 'Spike Lee Joint,' you're aware of the common threads woven into all of his movies. You come to expect certain elements and even certain actors. The fact that the supporting cast included such venerable thespians as Ossie Davis (Judge Buchanon), John Turturro (Don Angelo), Lonette McKee (Lottie) and Joie Lee (Gloria), while featuring a fabulous soundtrack by Terence Blanchard should be a surprise to no one. The fact that those actors, combined with Monica Belucci (Simona), Brian Dennehy (Chairman Church) and Woody Harrelson (Powell) didn't amount to a great movie should be tremendously surprising\\x85and disappointing.<br /><br /> From the opening credits, Spike Lee's signature is everywhere. From the rich combination of jazz and orchestral sensibilities in the underlying music bed that set the tone and timbre of the movie, you know Spike Lee is here. From the blatant opening reference and disdain of President George Bush; you knew the direction this vehicle headed and who was at the wheel.<br /><br />According to Lee, 'The story of 'She Hate Me' is very simple. It's about sex, greed, money and politics.'<br /><br />Yes and no. It's about all of those things, but it's far from being simple.<br /><br />The message to be delivered was loud and clear. Unfortunately, this message was one of at least 75 different and varied lessons 'She Hate Me' would offer to its viewers. Even more unfortunately, Spike chose oration for each and every 'message' in sermonizing character dialogue. Either Spike no longer respects his viewers enough to allow them to 'figure it out on their own' or that verbally bludgeoning them with his viewpoints (all 75 of them) is now considered a more viable storytelling alternative.<br /><br />The story of 'She Hate Me' is ostensibly about Jack Armstrong and his attempt at getting out of one sticky situation by entering another. In fact, it's not. This movie is more about the relationships and realities of women in love with one-another. This movie is at its best when Spike demonstrates that regardless of gender or orientation; insecurity and jealousy are universal. The desires of family and fidelity are also universal, irrespective of familial unit structure. Most importantly, the need to be accepted unconditionally is a definitive trait in all of us. Those arguably were the most important messages in this movie and Lee is right on the mark.<br /><br />Where 'She Hate Me' specifically missteps is that the story is from the point of view of an unsympathetic character. When Jack first started his new 'business' he supposedly needed money for the moment to counterbalance his frozen assets and continuing financial responsibilities. Yet 18 women, 19 children and some $180,000 later, neither Spike Lee, co-writer Michael Genet nor character Jack himself offers a reason as to why he continued such dangerous and fruitless indiscretions, for so long.<br /><br />The characters and relationships most enjoyable in this movie were fleeting in nature; components remarkably and conspicuously absent after introduction for most of the film. Jack's relationship with his father Geronimo (played by Jim Brown) was engaging. The sight of football Hall-of-Famer Jim Brown playing a character fighting diabetes and to save his marriage simultaneously was moving. The newly evolving relationship of Geronimo with his son in the midst of the chaos around him was another meaningful subplot; one of many that Lee didn't revisit until nearly the end of the movie.<br /><br />A monologue by Don Angelo (John Turturro) gave us another glimpse of Turturro's acting brilliance. John Turturro is a future Academy Award winner; it's just a shame this won't be the role that does it for him.<br /><br />If there is an explanation as to why some sub-stories and sub-plots were not covered as deeply as others it would be the fact that there are so many characters, all of which feel compelled to tell their life story. In fact, there are just too many people to keep up with, too many to care about in the end. It's like juggling fiery bowling pins, where too much concentration on one leads to really bad consequences.<br /><br />Visually, 'She Hate Me' pays homage to films of the 1970's, with its simplistic camera angles devoid of lighting tricks or steady-cams. The knowing use of varying hues and blurred frames was quite appealing stylistically, even cool. This, combined with great musical cues featuring tenor saxophone melodies was a nice tip of the fedora to the Film Noir genre.<br /><br />'She Hate Me' is raw and gritty in its imagery, remarkable in its musicality and at times sensual in its delivery\\x85but ultimately not a good movie.\",\n"," \"I have seen the movie Holes and say that it has to be the best movie all year long. It brings out the child in everyone. I mean who would come up with the idea of having troublesome boys dig holes as their punishment? Louis Sachar thats who. Although the movie was different from the book it was still very good. For example Caveman/Stanley was supposed to be the biggest one there. Weight wise and height wise but ZigZag/Ricky was taller and Armpit/Theodore was bigger. Also X-Ray/Rex was supposed to be one of the smallest boys but wasn't. The only thing that I didn't like about the movie was that the flashbacks were rather persuasive and long. I would have rather seen more of the present than past but thats just my opinion. I especially like the work of the boys though. Like Squid/Alan who was played by Jake M.Smith was supposed to be a moody and tough kid. Jake M.Smith performed just that and did a great job at it as did almost all of the actors in Holes.

Hip-hop culture is so pervasive these days that it's difficult not to keep hearing about it over and over. (If only we could say the same about bagpipe music.)

Martin Short, as someone else had mentioned, is an acquired taste -- a taste that I do not care for and actually found somewhat annoying. I couldn\\'t believe the original Neil, Laura, and Charlie were brought back though I felt they were used as filler characters more than anything. They didn\\'t have any kind of situation or purpose in the movie other than to become victims of Jack Frost\\'s Polar Ice breath. Santa Claus seemed to enjoy the company of his ex-wife much more so than his current one. The omission of Bernard is inexcusable. The \"legendary characters\" was a bit much and didn\\'t add to the story, especially the Easter Bunny\\'s horrible 70\\'s Wookie costume. The kids playing the elves didn\\'t even look thrilled to be there, regardless of who was playing Santa. The set from the first movie was huge -- outside looked like a dark, expansive glacier and indoors was a gigantic toy workshop. In this movie the outdoor set looked more like the sunny, bubbly Dr. Seuss Land at Islands of Adventure, and anything indoors was inconceivably tiny and elf-like, completely ignoring the fact that the \"head elf\", Santa, is a full-sized man.<br /><br />The special effects were far worse than the first movie 12 years ago. In the first movie, the producer actually cared about the outcome and therefore sunk a large sum of money into the best special effects at the time. SC3 showcases every possible SFX shortcut. The CGI reindeer were pathetic -- the cartoony Scooby Doo eyes were just stupid. Just goes to show you that the art of puppeteering is gone for good. The \"magic snow globe\" looked like a novelty souvenir bought at a convenience store. Santa\\'s sleigh looked like a poorly-built plywood prop. A lot of the sound effects were textbook cartoon fare...for a cartoon made 50 years ago. These kinds of details do not go unnoticed.<br /><br />The filmmakers even had the audacity to use actual cut-scenes from the first movie - about 90 seconds worth - which to me is pretty tacky; seems like they just needed some more filler.<br /><br />The entire movie is supposed to be a story being told by Mrs. Claus to her classroom but the introduction was so short I forgot all about that. I thought the movie was ending just as it cut back to the classroom with about 3 more minutes of movie. I\\'m glad I stayed for the Buddy Claus scene though - the generic baby with a red scarf on his head was the star of this scene.<br /><br />This movie was so dumbed down it\\'s unbelievable. Seeing the first movie at the young age I did of course I wasn\\'t going to understand some of the adult humor. As I grew up, though, it was a lot of fun to understand some of the jokes that I had missed as a kid, which is what\\'s so appealing about that movie. In SC3, if a 6 year-old fails to understand something it\\'s because he\\'s had some kind of unfortunate mental handicap.<br /><br />The storyline\\'s been described so many times by other members it\\'s not worth it for me to go into. What I haven\\'t seen anybody mention, however, is that this is a Christmas movie featuring Santa Claus on Christmas Eve and there is barely any mention of delivering toys to kids, much less any kind of action taken in preparation to do so.

Travolta wishes to write a piece about how health clubs in the 1980s are replacing the singles bars of the 1970s as the #1 place for people to meet. Take that premise and see how long you can stretch it. Director Bridges apparently thought he could drag it out for nearly two hours and still keep our attention.<br /><br />This film suffers from a severe lack of focus. There are too many location changes to count. There is also too much running around and too much time wasted on insignificant little things. For example, what was up with Travolta's sudden trip to Morocco near the end of the film. It had no purpose what so ever! Another problem this film has is its tendency to drag out every scene to last as long as whatever cheesy 80s dance song is playing in the background. That gets old pretty darn quick.<br /><br />This film is also hopelessly dated in terms of fashion. If any guy came into my health club wearing tights or a fish-net tank top, he'd probably get beaten up. Bridges & CO also try to recycle a gag that worked in Urban Cowboy. In that film, there was a scene featuring numerous women dressed up for a Dolly Parton look-alike contest. In this film, we get about a hundred people dressed up as Boy George in a scene at a hotel. In Urban Cowboy it worked since there was a legitimate reason for all the people to dress that way. They were at least trying to win a contest. The scene in Perfect is useless and it only serves to date the film even further. <br /><br />This film was by no means Travolta's worst. Has anyone seen The Experts or Shout? This film did, however, have his most embarrassing scene. In it, he's sweating away in Jamie Lee Curtis's aerobics class and doing a never-ending series of pelvic thrusts to the dance beat. His crotch has obviously been stuffed with a sock, or perhaps the thing Hammer used in his Pumps in a Bump video. Truly hilarious!<br /><br />Travolta is a talented actor, but he has nothing to work with here. Jamie Lee Curtis is also a great talent, but she is wasted as well. She looks absolutely gorgeous, but her character is so moody and abrasive that we can hardly stand her. The supporting cast of mostly unknowns fills out their respective stereotypical roles as well as they can.<br /><br />In all, this is a poor film on all levels. It tries to be an insightful look at journalistic ethics and falls flat on its face. It comes off as being little more than a two hour plug for Rolling Stone Magazine. Too Bad.<br /><br />3 of 10 stars<br /><br />So sayeth the Hound.\",\n"," \"I was really disappointed by this film. Having seen Julian Sands' name on the box, I thought 'OK, well, he's been in some pretty bad films (Arachnophobia, Boxing Helena etc.), but he's also been good in things, so I'll give it a go'. Plus it was screened at last year's Frightfest, which is usually a guide to a film's quality. Having a Spanish director also sounded good, given that it was set in Spain...<br /><br />But whilst the setting, costumes etc. were all amazing, and the script was pretty good, the actors really let it down, particularly Mr Sands, the lead actress and the professor - I couldn't take any of his scenes seriously! Probably worth seeing if you haven't got anything better to do, but don't expect a masterpiece or quality acting (with the exception of Antonio, who was well worth the cost of rental).\",\n"," \"After having watched Koyaanisqatsi two or three dozen times and loving every second of it, I finally had a chance to see it's sequel Life In Transformation. I was truly dissappointed as it did not nearly stand up to the high standards of the first. 90 minutes of people with baskets on their head is not my idea of a good movie. The Philip Glass score for this one had neither the beauty nor the correlating strength of the first. Compared with Koyaanisqatsi this movie seemed slow and pointless. A watered down version of Baraka, which is the same idea but done better. I truly hope the third movie in this series will not follow the example of this waste.\",\n"," \"I have really nothing to add to all the other comments, save this: To me the film looked like a silent film slowly being adapted to sound. The text boards bringing the story along reinforced that impression I suppose. Along the way the actors were allowed to leave the stilted, theatre-like acting; Marguerite Churchill very much looks like a typical early silent movie heroine at the beginning of the film, but at the end is allowed finer expressions. Gus, the Swede?, reminded me of the comic characters of Shakespeare plays, and Windy sounded to me like an early Donald Duck.<br /><br />It truly amazed me that it was all filmed outdoors, on location, and even though the dust of all the wagons, horses and cattle obscured the view it must actually have been like that for the real settlers! It also was clear to me that many of those Indians must have been real, and I didn't detect any overt racism towards them. And John Wayne looks so incredibly young! As someone who became a real Wayne fan through the cavalry trilogy by John Ford, and thought that Stage Coach was Wayne's first as a leading star, this film was a revelation. The plot is very simple, again reminding me of a silent film, but the grit is very real indeed! An amazing film to have been made with that technique and under those conditions in 1930.\",\n"," \"I have to agree with what many of the other reviewers concluded. A subject which could have been thought-provoking and shed light on a reversed double-standard, failed miserably.<br /><br />Rape being a crime of violence and forced abusive control, the scenes here were for the most part pathetic. It would have been a better idea to cover short glimpses of what was happening and let the audience imagine the deed. And the victim's laugh with the cops, when he aborted his police complaint, seemed as genuine as that of the cops. No awkwardness, no hesitance to merely join in. I don't know if this was bad acting and or bad directing but someone missed the point entirely. As for his half-a**ed supposed search for his attackers, pathetic. They should have skipped most of the sex scenes - another monumental failure in themselves, and had him meet Colin Friels when he first went to the police. The story could have then been drawn forth with good dialog and the occasional flashback - and saved by the superior acting and presence Colin Friels - the only reason I watched this movie - brings to any project he does.<br /><br />The only concrete revelation of this movie, is, it was crap.\",\n"," \"Return of the Boogyman is a dreadful movie which doesn't play like a movie, it plays like an episode of a TV sitcom when they flashback to older episodes.

How boring this is.<br /><br />The movie really is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie.<br /><br />I have seen the first movie I don't want to see the same scenes over and over again and I don't know who would.

There they witness a spaceship crash, see a scientist being shot by a corrupt military man, stow away on a truck that\\'s loaded down with corpses (from the ship), and end up trapped in Majestic 12 headquarters; a military bunker/lab way underground (you need to take an elevator to get down there) where unorthodox experiments have been taking place. Some scientists have injected a tarantula with some alien DNA, said spider laid an egg inside one of the astronauts and said egg has hatched; resulting in a large, web-shooting spider monster with cell-regenerative properties that sinks its fangs into most of the supporting cast. The monster also grows bigger and bigger from one generation to the next, so at the finale we get a house-sized giant spider going on GODZILLA rampage on a college campus and through the city. It\\'s up to Marci and a buff military dude (Josh Green), both in their matching white tank tops, to stop the monster. Not to spoil the ending, but our heroine ends up hanging out of a helicopter on a rope trying to shoot a missile out of a bazooka (that looks like it was made by Nerf) right into the monster\\'s mouth.

Not to be outdone, Bugs time and again takes all of Daffy's tricks and turns them around--and in most cases it involves Daffy getting shot in the face!

Now, given I view Simon Pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius, I realise this is a rather big claim. And to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'Fido' will appeal to you.<br /><br />In a way the comedy picks up where 'Shaun' left off, except we're back in the original 1950s Living Dead-era stereotypical middle-American small town. The Zombie Wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well-adjusted, useful members of the community. This, so we're informed at the outset, is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at Zomcom - a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps? <br /><br />The beauty of the film lies in its dead-pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose. The charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect. Themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through - the veneer of good clean living, keeping up appearances, repressed emotion, muddled parental values, social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual.<br /><br />It's a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the film's all-round strong cast. It's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part.

Problem is, I really wanted to like this because of the environmental/physical similarities, but the dialog was inane and I suspect the original target audience was actually older than the 7 - 10 year old demographic to which it belongs (due to some fairly graphic violence, e.g., blood spatter). Also, the tone is so preachy I only kept watching so I might see if it could be saved by the insertion of a cute air-bunny or something to provide comic relief (no luck there, just whining pirates).

Maybe it's David Milch's Shakespearean language. Whatever it is, Deadwood ranks as one of the best and most unusual series in television history.<br /><br />If you are a fan of great character actors or just excellent acting in general, this is the series for you because Deadwood is all about the people. That may sound obvious, but Deadwood's brilliance comes entirely from its characters and what they have to say. You could set them on the moon and they would still fascinate.<br /><br />Noting a few of my favorites, Ian McShane has always been fabulous but what fun to see him as the foul-mouthed Al Swearengen. He dominates the town by sheer force of personality. Of course, Al is also very intelligent and frequently finds himself surrounded by idiots - a couple of said idiots wonderfully played by William Sanderson and W. Earl Brown. Powers Boothe, who excels at charismatic villains (anyone remember him as Jim Jones?) has fun with Cy Tolliver.

In an age filled so-called 'monsters' which are no more than laughable men-in-rubber-suit creations or lizards dressed up in frills and forced to rip each other to pieces (cheap exploitation-style), it's refreshing to discover that the Plesiosaur in this little gem is an excellent Harryhausen-style stop-motion creature.<br /><br />Quite a hard film to find, but it's worth finding.\",\n"," \"I can appreciate what Barney is trying to achieve, but after sitting through this last night at a college movie house, I couldn't help but think...when is this gonna end? A very long and ponderous two hours and fifteen minutes. I had only seen a part of Cremaster 3 on DVD and thought I knew what to expect. That said, experimental films such as this are better digested in small increments. There are a couple of beautiful/horrible images...including the title sequence (no kidding), but if you go into this expecting any kind of plot or meaning, then you are in for a long, snooze-inducing ride. I managed to stay awake for the whole thing (if that's a compliment) but more often than not, I was waiting for some kind of meaning or narrative...big mistake. Among the collection of images are a very ornate gift-wrapping ceremony, the creation of a disgusting dish of what appears to be petroleum jelly slabs formed with a cookie cutter and sprinkled with shrimp (this is served to the crew of the ship which is shown throughout the film), a large blubber cheesecake with a large tentacle turd placed in the center of it, and the mutual evisceration of Bjork and director Matthew Barney which eventually culminates in some bizarre kind of communion, followed by their transformation into whale-like creatures. The soundtrack is at times beautiful and annoying...sometimes even maddening. At one time, there is a song being sung by Bjork to go along with the ephemeral rituals being played before us, and at other times there is just a constant droning of a high-pitched instrument, which we see a mysterious woman playing at the beginning and end of the movie. If this sounds like it doesn't make sense, that is because is DOESN'T! If this sounds like your cup of tea, then you will absolutely LOVE it! If this sounds like something that you probably won't like, then stay far away from it, because you will most likely walk out of the theater during the halfway mark like several people at the screening I attended. This is the very definition of an art film. You get from it what you take from it. But otherwise, there really isn't much there, other than a few oddities and constant construction and deconstruction rituals. I'm glad that there is a place for films such as this, but I can't say I would want to sit through it again. However, I can't say I wouldn't want to see one of Barney Cremaster films from start to finish and compare it with this. I think, perhaps now that I know what to expect I might enjoy something like this more. To give you an idea of what kind of comprehension factor this film has, I probably would've liked it better if I had gotten stoned. Then again, it could've felt twice as long as it was, and then it would've REALLY gotten ponderous. Definitely not for everyone.\",\n"," 'I tried to watch this and actually lost interest, except of course when \"Leatherface\" was sawing off the face of a hapless victim, in the fashion of Ed Gein.<br /><br />One of the problems is the female lead; just couldn\\'t have an interest in whether she made it or not. R. Lee Ermey is always a good addition; couldn\\'t help but wonder how much he was being paid for this, and how did he end up doing this after doing the great Kubrick film \"Full Metal Jacket\".<br /><br />In fairness, I loved the first TCM and even Part 2.

She soon starts to regret it as Ryan grows erratic by the hour, it appears that she is host to a dangerous schizophrenic, and now she is unable to escape her house.<br /><br />Beware, My Lovely is adapted from Mel Dinelli\\'s {The Spiral Staircase} story and play called \"The Man\". Pretty much a one set movie and a two character driven piece, the film boasts two great central performances and offers up an interesting take on mental illness. One however shouldn\\'t be fooled into thinking this is a violent and nerve shredding picture, because it isn\\'t. It\\'s clear from the get go that Ryan\\'s Howard Wilton is a dangerously troubled man, but this is a different sort of \"peril\" movie. One that throws up another slant on psychosis and thus makes it difficult to hate our dangerous protagonist.<br /><br />Ryan and Lupino are a great combination, they had also done the excellent, and far better, On Dangerous Ground this same year. So with both actors clearly comfortable together, it brings out a finely tuned character story all based in the confines of one house, re: prison. Ryan is particularly strong as his character flits in and out of madness, with some scenes powerful and at times inducing fear and at others garnering deep sympathy. The direction from Harry Horner is safe {he in truth doesn\\'t have to do much other than let his actors run with it} and George E. Diskant\\'s cinematography contains some smart and impacting visual touches. With one involving Christmas tree baubles immensely memorable. Falling some where in between being average and great, Beware, My Lovely has enough about it to make it a recommendation to fans of borderline and easy to follow Film-Noir. For fans of Robert Ryan tho, it\\'s something of an essential viewing, oh yes, and then some. 7/10',\n"," 'The mental illness portrayed in \"Possessed\" is what the Victorians called hysteria. It consists of being a woman and being treated very badly by a socially and sexually superior man.<br /><br />David Sutton (Van Heflin) is an unthinking cad who wanted casual sex with a vulnerable, lonely employee from a nearby holiday house. Being his social inferior, Louise (Joan Crawford) thought she could improve herself by going all the way with him (a big deal back then because birth control was so primitive). This rash move causes her to get desperate when she senses David\\'s coolness, and then deeply wounded and enraged when he callously ends their affair.<br /><br />Although the movie attributes it all to \"love\", it is her sexual betrayal by David, and the casual arrogance of his superior social status, that unbalance her. Moreover, things go wrong at her residence, where she works as a servant or nurse to a married woman who falsely accuses her of involvement with her husband, an accusation that is echoed by the returning daughter. This further injustice by her social superiors drives her unhinged.<br /><br />The story is told in flashback after she goes into a \"hysterical\" trance on the streets of downtown Los Angeles. There\\'s a lot of psychiatric lingo around her treatment and confession, but the illness is no \"hysteria\", it is frustrated outrage against social and gender injustice --- only Hollywood can never tell it that way.<br /><br />Above all, women could not be told the truth about their condition after World War Two, when they had to be driven out of the factories where they had worked beside men and back into the home to be consumer housewives.<br /><br />This is really a Victorian throw-back morality tale: it was exactly the kind of case with which the Sigmund Freuds made their name by locking up troubled wives and daughters in Imperial Austria. That said, it\\'s a well-told yarn with great studio sets and a strong central performance. Note the cameo scene at the bar between Geraldine Brooks and Van Heflin. When he takes his eyes off her to ogle the cigarette girl, Geraldine says: \"That\\'s so American, wanting more than you\\'ve got!\" Yes, this film fails to get to grips with the underlying issues, but it\\'s enjoyable \"noir\" fiction nonetheless.',\n"," \"As far as movies go, this one has what is popular: action, adventure, sex, blood, and lots of twists that will keep you guessing what the truth is.<br /><br />However, if you've read Beowulf (which, judging by the reviews, is a small number of people), and you appreciate the characters and hold them in a place of dignity and respect in your mind, then forget about appreciating anything about the movie. Though Beowulf is portrayed in the epic as the great leader and hero who never has done a dishonorable deed, he is, in the movie, portrayed as a liar and a deceiver. He defeats Grendel by closing his arm in a door. He never kills Grendel's mother because she seduces him and together, they beget the Dragon. How does this even make any sense? He returns to the Geats claiming to have defeated Grendel's mother and is then made king by Hrothgar. This is, of course, good for Beowulf, because he has a thing for Wealtheow, Hrothgar's wife, anyway. The kind and noble King Hrothgar has also been degraded to a cheating husband who also sleeps with Grendel's mother (hence the existence of Grendel) and who end up killing himself after making Beowulf king. the only noble deed that Beowulf seems to achieve (in the movie) is by severing his own arm from his body and by tearing out the dragon's heart with his bare hand (neither of which is in the book, by the way.) Funny, in the book, I don't remember the fight with the dragon leaving the cave at all...<br /><br />We can only pray that someday someone does this epic justice and makes a decent film out of it.

But unfortunately it developed into a series for people who love seeing a lot of laser weapons shooting and spaceships shooting it out.<br /><br />A series that suffered much by episodes in between that did not pursuit the storyline and seemed not to fit in continuum. Sometimes you wondered why they did not use powerful objects from earlier episodes.<br /><br />The main characters were:<br /><br />Captain Dillon Hunt - Name should have been captain Perfect instead. So political correct it makes you want to puke. Strangely enough Mr. perfect have no troubles killing innocent prison guards while he time after time jeopardize the mission and his crew to protect female criminals. Always blaming others for their flaws and never admitting his own even when they nearly get everyone killed. If there is a female in the episode then he is always good for a kiss and more. When he starts kissing with woman number ten you start to see a pattern. It is fine with romance but always and with every woman he meets is plain stupid and annoying. In season 5 he even becomes even more righteous and use every opportunity to tell his crew how bad they handled themselves even if it is his error that put them in that mess. Worst thing is they chose such a bad actor to have the main role. I noticed several times it looked like he smiled when approaching his crew after they just had great personal loses.<br /><br />Andromeda - The worlds most powerful warship. Still anyone can get unnoticed on board and make every kind of sabotage on the ship. And never does it intercept transmissions from enemies on board to the outside. Sometimes two small space-fighters can nearly destroy Andromeda and other times it can destroy an entire fleet alone. I often wondered how come no one build a more powerful one the 300 years it was gone.<br /><br />Trance - First 3 seasons she should have been the mystery of the crew. It got fast boring and when you finally get the secret it is really not interesting.<br /><br />Harper - Character with more potential than always just being the puny scientist. My personal favorite nerd.<br /><br />Beka - In the last horrible season her role finally flowers and she is permitted to be more than Dillons puppet. She should have been written that way all the time.<br /><br />Tyr - The only character that developed throughout the series. Unfortunately that was destroyed in the end by incompetent writers.<br /><br />Nietzscheans - An unbelievable race that never really seems plausible. Unfortunately they have a very big role in the series.<br /><br />So if you want a series with interesting characters and stories then look for something else. This is very far from good sci-fi. It seemed like the writers ended up not knowing if they were writing a superhero or sci-fi series, and it turned out bad both ways.<br /><br />All in all I have a hard time understanding why many good sci-fi series die after one season or less and this lasted 5 seasons.',\n"," 'well \"Wayne\\'s World\" is long gone and the years since then have been hard for snl off-shoot movies. from such cinematic offal as \"It\\'s Pat\" to the recent 80 minute yawn, \"A Night at the Roxbury,\" many have, no doubt, lost faith that any other snl skit will ever make a successful transition to the silver screen. well fear not because Tim Meadows comes through in spades. the well-written plot maintains audience interest until the very end and while it remains true to the Leon Phelps character introduced in the five minute skit, the storyline allows the character to develop. the humor (consisting largely of sex jokes) is fresh and interesting and made me laugh harder than i have in any movie in recent memory. its a just great time if you don\\'t feel like taking yourself too seriously.

Most of the acting is below average, and the \"point-of-view\" moments are so old news. Acclaimed composer Christopher Young of such films as \"Hellraiser\" and \"Entrapment\" scored this, in a repetitive cue line that was better made for a TV movie.

If you are a viewer interested in cars this production, by producer Jerry Bruckheimer (\"Con Air,\" \"The Rock\"), is worth seeing just to feast your eyes on the glossy vehicles. Although the film secretes a stench of weakness in many areas, its precise sense of action and excitement make it a moderately successful summer thrill ride.<br /><br />\\tThe film stars Giovanni Ribisi (\"The Mod Squad\") as a young crook named Kip Raines, who, as the movie opens, fails to deliver a long list of expensive cars to the powerful criminal Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston). When Kip\\'s life is threatened because of such, his older brother, Randall \"Memphis\" Raines (Nicolas Cage), a retired but skillful car thief, is called upon to complete a task in exchange for his brother\\'s survival: steel fifty cars-specified by model, color, year, and make-in only four days.<br /><br />\\tMemphis disburses the first three days recruiting a team of bandits to help him pull off the heist. The crew includes Sara \"Sway\" Wayland (Angelina Jolie), a sexy yet gruff retired car swindler knowing Memphis through previous business, a fellow named Mirror Man (T.J. Cross), the aging and wise Otto Halliwell (Robert DuVall), as well as Tumbler (Scott Caan), Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott), and Donny Astricky (Chi McBrde). <br /><br />\\tContributing to the film\\'s drive and tension is a subplot involving two police detectives, Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant), who suspect from previous experience that Memphis and his crew are up to no good and keep an extra close eye on them.<br /><br />There is not much time for character development here; the audience gets to know these people though their rugged lifestyles and assume tough personalities through the films hard core, stylish atmosphere. To make matters even worse for the film, the dialogue fails to define the characters with a gritty cultural tone. I am not stating I think profanity and vulgarism is necessary for thrillers to flourish; I actually honor the director\\'s decision to sustain from extreme foul language in a movie that could have very effortlessly earned an R-rating. However, I do believe in a movie such as \"Gone in 60 Seconds,\" to strongly develop the character\\'s enlightenment, dialogue needs to be believable and authentic. <br /><br /> In spite of problems, the characters are effective due to the top notch, perfectly cast performers responsible. Nicolas Cage\\'s melodramatic performance is intense and convincing. Angelina Jolie\\'s sleazy appearance is completely appropriate here. Delroy Lindo is deliciously sturdy and believable. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Caan, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, and Christopher Eccleston provide persuasive supporting roles.<br /><br />\\tThe film contains standard structure, with a satisfactory first act that elaborates on the story\\'s style and the character\\'s motives, sets up a fast-paced theme of action, but lacks depth and strong character introduction. In the second act we run into a few more problems: the story wastes time during much of this segment, never really building up for the third act. While the middle of the movie occupies much time, and a sex scene provides a solid mid-plot, not a whole lot happens. The third act is pretty much a sheer adrenaline rush containing furious wall-to-wall excitement and one of the most intense car chase sequences ever filmed.<br /><br />\\tThe soundtrack to \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" contributes a great deal to the inspirational action scenes. It is scenes like the car chases that makes this movie work in spite of several destructive faults. Dominic Sena, whose career has mostly consisted of directing commercials, has an appealing style and a decisive attitude in \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" which will grant audiences with two hours of commotion, thrills, and excitement\\x85but not much more. <br /><br /> <br /><br />',\n"," \"If anything, William Girdler was an opportunist who wanted a piece of the action in regards to whatever was popular during the time. I mean, a blaxploitation flick in Louisville, Kentucky..who would of thunk it?!?! I can just imagine the enthusiasm he must've had getting Pam Grier, quite a hot item, to star in his picture. If you are pretty familiar with the genre, Girdler's Sheba, Baby doesn't necessarily stray too far from formula. Despite a change of venue, the film still deals with a ruthless businessman nicknamed Shark who muscles in on loan companies, using stooges to threaten them in order to get their signatures. <br /><br />Grier is Sheba Shayne, a former Louisville cop working in Chicago who returns home at the request of her father's partner, Brick(Austin Stoker, Assault on Precinct 13). Sheba's father, despite Shark's bullying tactics(..his man in town is Pilot, a wannabe gangster, equipped with stooges who aren't that menacing, rather buffoonish in nature, so thin-skinned they hire hit men outside of town to shoot up the Shayne Loan building), won't give up his company, and this eventually costs him his life when a warning through the use of brute force, leads to his being killed. Sheba will get her revenge on all those responsible for his father's death. In other words, Shark's ass is grass..can you dig it? <br /><br />Seeing Grier with a magnum is enough to sell this particular film, the novelty of the setting being in Louisville is part of the package. You even get to see a speedboat chase, Grier in shootouts with gangsters(..not necessarily the most polished kind one might be accustomed to seeing in a Chicago or New York during this period in blaxploitation), lots of blood spurting from bullet-riddled bodies torn apart by gun-fire, and colorful characters(..such as a wimpy loan shark in pimp-dress named Walker and Pilot who is one of the least scary mobsters you are likely to see)who show up during the film, most having the misfortune of coming in contact with a very angry Sheba. The plot itself is nothing special, but Grier is always worth watching, and Girdler orchestrates plenty of action sequences to keep his target audience entertained. A modest success for Girdler, and one of his more accomplished films.\",\n"," 'I was surprised to come upon this film \"Witness to Murder\" tonight on TV as I hadn\\'t heard of it before - always nice to discover an old movie with excellent, familiar actors. I get the impression of it being a part of the transitional period for some actors from movies to early TV dramas, in live productions that carry such realism as this film does.<br /><br />I tuned in late and missed the first few minutes of the movie where wily Albert Richter (George Sanders) is purported to have committed his evil deed; unfortunately Sanders has always been one of my favourite actors, one of the best ne\\'er-do-wells (as in The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, Samson and Delilah, and All About Eve), and I wasn\\'t a little old lady in those days but a budding teenager.

It isn\\'t smart enough to be drama and there\\'s no moment that\\'s in the slightest bit farcical. The most intriguing thing about this movie is how it has managed to get mostly glowing and positive reviews. I was tricked by those reviews, but you don\\'t have to be, gentle reader. All I want for Christmas is my three hours back.',\n"," 'There\\'s something frustrating about watching a movie like \\'Murder By Numers\\' because somewhere inside that Hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out. However, by the time the credits roll, there\\'s no saving it. The whole thing is pretty much blown by the \"cop side\" of the story, where Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin\\'s homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on. Although Bullock is strong in her role, it\\'s not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing. Ben Chaplin\\'s talents are wasted in a forgettable role (he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated \\'Birthday Girl\\') as well as Chris Penn, who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him. Anyway, the plot really isn\\'t even a factor in this movie at all. The two teen killers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie. Their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well. It\\'s too bad they weren\\'t in a much better all-around film. Barbet Schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker. Bottom Line: it\\'s worth a rent if you\\'re a genre fan, but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it, except maybe on network TV with convenient commercial breaks.',\n"," \"To be totally honest I wasn't expecting much at all going into 9 Souls even after reading heap upon heap of praise plied upon it but to say I was surprised would be a major understatement, in short I was totally blown away.<br /><br />The basic plot is as simple as they come, nine prison inmates ranging from a drug pusher all the way up to multiple murderer's escape from prison and go in search of a secret stash presumed to be forged money hidden by a tenth inmate who cracked and was dragged away by guards shortly before their escape but it's the direction that director Toshiaki Toyoda takes this simple story that is so brilliant and original perfectly blending drama, comedy and violence creating a truly one of kind movie that deserve's to be seen not only fans of Asian cinema but cinema in general.<br /><br />Superbly acted, emotional, funny, violent and at times very surreal this is a movie has it all.\",\n"," \"I came away from this movie with the feeling that it could have been so much better. Instead of what should be a gripping, tense story of a boy's fight for survival in the wilderness, it comes off as a National Geographic documentary meets Columbia sportswear ad.<br /><br />The film begins with Brian (Jared Rushton) preparing for a journey by plane to see his father. His mother fortuitously gives him the curious choice of a hatchet as a going-away gift (what's wrong with a Rubik's Cube?), little knowing how badly he will soon need it. Once in the air, the plane's pilot (a blink-and-you'll-miss-him cameo by Ned Beatty) suffers a fatal heart attack, leaving Brian helpless as the plane crashes into a lake. Extremely lucky to walk (or rather swim) away virtually unscathed, Brian must find shelter, food and hope for rescue.<br /><br />Here is where the main problem with the movie begins. By the very nature of Brian's solitude, Jared has very few lines to speak, and so the film ought to have compensated by ratcheting up the tension of each scene. Instead, he is shown walking around, sitting around, and so on, with only a minimal sense of danger. As a result, too much reliance is placed on flashbacks to the parents' troubled marriage as the source of tension. These scenes merely get in the way and don't particularly add much to the story. Even worse, occasionally Jared \\x96 his face covered with mud - lets out a primal scream or two, which conjures up unfortunate parallels to `Predator.' Speaking of unfortunate, we could have done with being spared the sight of his mullet, but it presumably helped keep him warm at night.<br /><br />Another disappointment is Pamela Sue Martin in a totally ineffectual performance as the mother. Both she and the father have very little impact in the movie. For instance, we are never shown how they react to news of Brian's disappearance, how they might be organizing rescue attempts, and so on. This is just one source of tension the film-makers would have done well to explore instead of spending so much time on events that happened before Brian embarked on his journey.\",\n"," 'People people people. Whew. Let\\'s not be hasty, selfish or unreasonable. Sure this movie had it\\'s flaws. The Locale\\'s may have seemed just a teensy bit artificial(the most common critique), but downing the movie because Sam Jackson \"stole\" the violin, and on top of that attributing it to his color is downright UNCALLED FOR!<br /><br />And further more, to say that \"the times we live in\" are the reason for us over looking the fact the violin was whisked away immorally is a clear fall back on cliche for a lack of intelligence. Because that\\'s what this person is challenging. The morality of what Jackson did in the closing moments of the movie. If we were to really analyze the morality from each owner to the next, we would find that morality was not really the wave of fortune the violin was riding on(it was stolen from a grave for crying out loud, not to mention almost burned for simply being... a violin). If not liking it because of it\\'s closing immorality is not missing the point and the essence and the true exsistence of this film, then I don\\'t know what is.<br /><br />This movie, as shockingly revealed as it was, was not about the life of this inanimate object. Surely the violin did not have a life. It was merely the carrier for the essence of the character of Anna Bussotti, Nicolo\\'s wife. Because he used her to complete the instrument, it was endowed with her essence. That is where you are to find your morality in the tale. That life, our life, our essence, our being, is lived not only in our bodies, in these pathetic heaps of flesh and bone, but in everything around us. The morality is that Nicolo\\'s love for his wife, made her immortal in the violin, and her song, was a gift passed down to each of the ones touched by the violin\\'s life.<br /><br />Therefore it is quite inconsequential, the morality of the people(and their actions) and events surrounding the violin, to say that it is the times we live in, or the race of the man stealing the violin, because the story encompasses a much higher enlightenment. Easily seen, too, if you don\\'t analyze the mistemperments and shortcomings of the people surrounding the voilin to a point where they consume your vision, blocking the \"true\" lesson or moral, or whatever you want to call it. The lesson, or better put: the essence of \"life\".<br /><br />Tres bien by Girard.

That is just so unfair, because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist. He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children, and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride.<br /><br />But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me. Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination. Ask yourself this question: if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical, what would it be like? The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa, because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true. Every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air-flying sequences... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself. Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi! Everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here.\",\n"," \"I couldn't find one redeeming quality in this pretentious mess.

BLOOD CASTLE is one of those trashy European horror films that has almost no redeeming quality except for being thoroughly entertaining, for all the bad reasons. The opening alone was worth the price of the DVD: our heroine, Dr. Ivanna, arrives at the castle where she\\'s supposed to help a scientist, Baron Dalmar, who does experiments on dead tissue. On her way to the castle 1) a man tries to rape Ivanna. 2) the castle\\'s housekeeper fights with her. 3) the maid wants her dead. 4) and finally, Baron Dalmar nearly spits on her and wants her out the next day. Hmm...something tells me she\\'s not welcome. With such a miserable arrival, you\\'d think Ivanna would leave the place in a NY minute but no, like so many great trashy films, our \"headstrong\" heroine decides to stay put and even enjoys a candlelight dinner with the grumpy Baron on that same eventful day. The intro is so over-the-top trashy (it\\'s even greater than the memorable first few minutes of that Canadian film, JUNIOR) that I knew I was going to enjoy this.<br /><br />But the fun doesn\\'t end there. Ivanna is repeatedly drugged whenever she goes to bed at night, only to wake up from unconsciousness, naked, bound and tortured in mild sessions of S&M by an unseen man. Even after experiencing these nightly S&M sessions, Ivanna stays at the castle, dully convinced by the angry Baron that what she\\'s experiencing are nothing more than dreams. To be expected, even after being treated so badly from the get-go, Ivanna, falls in love with the Baron. Ivanna completely disregards anything negative about him, including the obvious fact that the dour Baron is popular with the young ladies. Every women at the castle (it seems only women work there) is in love with the miserable chump, who doesn\\'t mind taking advantage of the pretty young things. Things get even sillier as someone lurks around the estate and kills (and has been killing) women. Basically, the Baron\\'s physically disfigured brother, Igor is responsible for everything. In a very long winded scene, the brother warns the Baron he should not get too involved with Ivanna or he\\'ll suffer the consequences. So what do the Baron and Ivanna do about this? Well, they get married of course! During the very brief marriage ceremony, the Baron is shot by one of the angry locals (father of one of the dead girls). But all of this doesn\\'t deter Ivanna, who, amidst all the dead young ladies and torture surrounding them, cheerfully comforts the hurt Baron that \"it\\'s just a flesh wound\" and the two can go on and enjoy their honeymoon at the castle, where the killer/rapist/torturer brother is. The whole thing quickly devolves into a nightmarish love triangle of sorts, between Ivana, the Baron and Igor. Blame it all on love!<br /><br />Anyway, you get the idea: subtle it\\'s not. Almost everything is over-the-top ridiculous in this film and when it\\'s not OTT, such as the predictable climax, things get a tad boring. But for most of the film, the director or writer revel in one illogically trashy moment after another. I really love these kind of films, everything as subtle as being hit over the head with a sledgehammer, and populated by characters behaving illogically. Even those who made the Retromedia DVD realize this and when you go to the scene selection section, we hear one of the funniest bits of dialogue from the dubbed movie looped endlessly. <br /><br />The production values are beautifully risible. The opening and closing credits, with those candles and red curtains...ah, a soupçon of class. The music sounds sometimes like something from a Tim Burton film, which only adds to the oddness of it all. And customary to these kind of films, when the young ladies take off their clothes, they just beg to be killed.<br /><br />As a standard film, I rate this a 2, but as a \"it\\'s so bad it\\'s good\" film, I rate it a solid 8 stars. If you enjoy trashy films, please watch this one. It\\'s a must see.

I was expecting a gore fest and instead got a film with low body count and no gore. This film is actually very good. Their are a lot of interesting little things in this movie proving way ahead of the current events of our time. The lead character is constantly having flashbacks of his childhood. Most interesting is the priest flashbacks, the film seems to hint that he was molested by a priest especially of the quick shots of the boy on his knees possibly in a confessional booth. Ironically this issue is currently all over the news. It's almost as if the writer knew of a dirty little secret and was exposing it with this film. The character's army flashbacks are interesting too, especially since real life serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer had a bad experience in the army as well. It seems to me at second look that this film is a realistic look of how a lonley individual with serious past issues can slowly become completly insane and end up murdering people. To top it off there is some funny dialogue by the old ladies in this film to soften the serious tone. A second look at this film reveals a seriously under rated study of insanity. The original title Slipping into Darkness fits the movie better than the Blood Shed tag which will steer you the wrong way!\",\n"," 'Warning may contain spoilers<br /><br />Since this didn\\'t make theatres (thank God) every DVD and VHS with this movie on it deserves to be axed, chainsawed, stabbed, nailgunned and everything that Patrick Bateman did to his victims in the movie and book. Whereas the original had originality, humour, sharp wit, and good script writing, great direction and acting talent, this movie lacks all of them. Harron, Turner, Bale, Sevigny, Dafoe and others made a great movie. Of which both the making and finished product was put through the ringer with locations withdrawn at the last minute, shooting having to keep a low profile, and banning attempts. The result was a work of art. But this film undoes all the work of the original.<br /><br />The acting is wooden, characters are played lamely, and lack any emotion, charisma or personality. Wit is non-existent, and the attempts at humour are so lame that if I were to laugh I would laugh at the patheticness of it all. The music is awful and the voice over (unlike in the true American Psycho) is annoying. And while there seems to be an attempt at sending up campus life and politics, it is not a redeeming factor at all and the writers appear to give up on it after not too long.<br /><br />It is simply a teen slasher movie that has (for reasons unknown) added the name American Psycho to itself, and brought in the Patrick Bateman angle. It is like this scenario; Artist A does a painting, Artist B does their own painting, but then places scenes and subjects from the work of Artist A. I am not sure how long this sequel was in planning or when it was decided, but thats the situation as I see it. All that differntiates from teen slashers is that we know who is doing the killings, but that was taken out of the \"first\". So theres no originality there.<br /><br />What is really bad about this film is that it tells you that Bateman actually did the killings in the true American Psycho. The only person who has the right to say whether Patrick really did commit the murders or not is Ellis. He was the author of the original American Psycho story, therefore only he should decide. I read that Ellis in fact, stated that in the novel, all that actually ever happened was that Bateman might have horrible thoughts of you and draw horrible pictures as well. That the killings didn\\'t really take place was also conveyed (as I saw it) in the original. So don\\'t all we who executed the sequel feel silly now? And even though I have called this a sequel (for ease of writing) I do not recognise it as such. As far as I am concerned we left the world of Bateman in the novel when the final page was turned (even though I never read it properly), and in the film when the end credits began rolling. Until Ellis writes a continuation of American psycho, to me Bateman is alive and kicking.<br /><br />See only if you\\'re absoloutely desparate or want to write a critical review of a movie. Otherwise avoid at all costs.<br /><br />',\n"," 'For starters and for the record, the term \"Necromancy\" describes the black magic art of bringing the dead back to life and it does NOT, in any way, relate to having sex with cadavers. That is called necrophilia and, yes, I know it\\'s an obvious difference but I\\'m already getting a lot of remarks from acquaintances and relatives that I sport a perverted taste in movies! This movie is quite the opposite of perverted or sleazy, in fact, and merely just qualifies as boring, inept and terribly bad. \"Necromancy\" makes at least one top five ranking, namely in the list of most incoherent movies ever made! Now, director Bert I. Gordon is not exactly famous for delivering masterpieces (on his repertoire there are titles like \"Earth vs. the Spider\", \"King Dinosaur\" and \"Food of the Gods\") but he really surpassed himself here with a totally senseless, redundant and utterly nonsensical tale about witchcraft and secretive little towns. Shortly after the tragic experience of seeing their baby being born dead, Lori and her husband Frank move to the quiet little town of Lillith, where Frank suddenly got offered a prominent job in a toy factory. Lori is suspicious and senses an atmosphere of morbidity, especially with the town\\'s patriarch and \"owner\" Mr. Cato behaving very obtrusive and mysterious. That\\'s another thing. How can anybody \"own\" a town and everybody in it? Either way, Lori gradually discovers that everybody in Lillith is a witch and Mr. Cato exclusively lured her to the town because of her supernatural ability to resurrect the dead. Since many years already, Cato has been trying to bring his deceased son back to life and he\\'s prepared to make any human sacrifice it takes. I honestly don\\'t see the point of the whole movie.

When, where and how did Lori suddenly learn to resurrect the dead? \"Necromancy\" definitely contains a few genuinely uncanny and atmospheric moments, but these are unwarily accomplished either by complete coincidence or through a total lack of budget.

Laura (Mariel Hemingway) and Marty (Mike Binder) are a regular couple with an ordinary sex life. But Marty is obsessed with a fantasy where he and Laura have a threesome with another woman. He goads her semi-seriously and when she finally shows some interest, he convinces her to invite over a girl from work who has been coming on to her.<br /><br />But Marty soon learns that you have to be careful what you wish for. After an initial reluctance, Laura gets into it and finds she likes it. We're talking SERIOUS liking here. Marty is initially ecstatic that his fantasy has been fulfilled, but now that he has opened Pandora's Box (so to speak), he is not prepared for the Sex Monster that emerges. Laura becomes a sex crazed Lesbian nymphomaniac and proceeds to seduce all their female friends. This leads to numerous awkward situations, some zany, some silly and some just downright hilarious.<br /><br />This film is just rollicking good fun. The sex is mostly implied, so if you were hoping to see Mariel Hemingway or anyone else naked, you are pretty much out of luck. There is a lot of moaning and bed shaking but nothing really provocative other than a couple of girl kissing scenes. But explicit sex isn't what this movie is about. It's about the comedy, and the comedy works, so it is just as well.<br /><br />This is really the Mike Binder show. He wrote, directed and starred in the film. He didn't really excel in any of these roles, but somehow the whole exceeded the sum of the parts. He gave a generally droll performance which was occasionally terrible but more often comical. He was at his best when he was being tormented by Laura's obsession as he tried desperately to get the sex genie back in the bottle.<br /><br />Mariel Hemingway was terrific in this film and made it truly funny. This is her second role with a bisexual theme having appeared in the heavy handed 'Personal Best' where she was an athlete who alternated between sleeping with her male coach and a female teammate. Her performance in this part was far better and she turns out to be a much better comedian than dramatic actress. She has a great ability to make humorous use of her 6 foot frame and made the most of the many sight gags in the script.<br /><br />I rated this movie a 7/10. It doesn't redefine the genre, but it is a wacky sex farce that has more than its share of funny moments.

The dialog is flat, filled with cliché overused lines and delivered by amateur actors who sound like their reading a script for the first time. The choppy, shaky, film style is a cheap imitation of the \"The Ring\" style visual effects. The characters do not even act like a normal person would. For example, the character who is looking for her twin sister at her home forces her way through the front door, creeps around the house all frightened and sobbing and she doesn\\'t even once call out her sister\\'s name to see if she is home. What? You would think she had just buried her sister instead of searching for her. Way too many flashbacks to her childhood. Too many unnecessary flashbacks is a typical sign of an amateur director. It is actually funny watching the numerous shots of the woman driving her car down the street, up the driveway, around this corner, over here, over there, oh a side view, now a front view.

Due to my interest in acting, mainly in High School productions, I, along with my five brothers and sisters and Mother who was a bit of a ham herself, answered a \"cattle call\" for crowd scenes at Benton Airfield. Because I was Burt Lancaster\\'s general height and build and was the same size, 42 Long, I was upgraded to Stand-in for him and ended up standing in for all the principle male characters except Gene Hackman who used his brother. There was a scene in a park in El Dorado, KS where Deborah Kerr and Burt Lancaster sit on a merry-go-round and talk. He then stands up and leans in rather closely to Ms. Kerr. The director wanted to change the lighting on that particular shot to compensate for Mr. Lancaster\\'s new position. He called for the \"Seconds\" to take the actors\\' places while they fine tuned the lighting. At that moment Deborah\\'s stand-in was over by the swings, in the process of losing the greasy chili which had been catered that night and couldn\\'t answer the call. John Frankenheimer was upset by her failure to report and acted like he was about to fire her, but, always the gracious lady, Ms. Kerr said she was fine just sitting there and would stand in for herself. The scene required that Burt Lancaster lean in to the point that their faces are mere inches apart. There she was, the consummate professional and I, standing in for Mr. Lancaster, was face to face with an actress I had loved ever since seeing her in such films as \"From Here to Eternity\" and \"The King and I\". It\\'s understating my uneasiness by saying I was sweating bullets and worrying about my breath. She sensed my discomfort and proceeded to ask me questions like what I aspired to be (she didn\\'t say \\'when I grew up\\', which was, to me, just more evidence of her class) to set me at ease. At the time I was very interested in an acting career and she said that if I ever got to Hollywood to look her up and she would get me an appointment with her agent. What amazed me about the exchange was that I realized she was serious and would very probably have taken the time out of her busy schedule to do just that. My esteem for her grew many fold that night. Although I understand she now lives in Switzerland, I have often thought that even though I am in my 50\\'s and gave up the thought of acting professionally years ago, it would be great if she still lived in Hollywood and I was able contact her.

Not as salacious as it sounds, this is a three-part documentary (each episode is 50 minutes) featuring Slovenian superstar philosopher/psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek. Zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films, exploring themes of sexuality, fantasy, morality and mortality. It was directed by Sophie Fiennes, of the multi-talented Fiennes clan (she's sister to actors Ralph and Joseph).<br /><br />I enjoyed this quite a bit, although I think it will be even more enjoyable on DVD, since there is such a stew of ideas to be digested. Freudian and Lacanian analysis can be pretty heavy going and seeing the whole series all at once became a bit disorienting by the end of two and a half hours. It didn't help that an ill-advised coffee and possession of a bladder led me to some discomfort for the last hour or so.<br /><br />My only real issue with this is that Zizek picked films that were quite obviously filled with Freudian themes. He spends quite a bit of time on the films of Hitchcock and David Lynch, not exactly masters of subtlety. I would have liked to see him try to support his theories by using a wider range of films, although that's really just me saying I'd like to see part four and five and six.<br /><br />Zizek is very funny, and part of the humour was watching him present what amounted to a lecture while inserting himself into the actual scenes from some of the films he's discussing. So, for instance, we see him in a motorboat on his way to Bodega Bay (from Hitchcock's The Birds) or sitting in the basement of the Bates Motel (from Psycho). Which is not to say that his theories are not provocative. Even when I found myself disagreeing with him, it definitely made me think a little more deeply about the films. Which is exactly what he's trying to accomplish.\",\n"," 'There were no surprises in this completely unoriginal erotic thriller, but then again, who watches these films for the plot?

Ms Paltrow is aloof, as her character requires, but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment from her own actions. In other words, she does not seem to care enough of the results of her match-making endeavours. Some of the supporting cast is guilty of over-acting - very much in the style that is appreciated on stage but out of place in motion pictures. Personally, I had problems accepting Alan Cumming as Mr Elton - to no fault of his own, except for having left such an impression as a gay trolley-dolly in \"The High Life\" that it is now difficult to accept him playing any serious part.

What\\'s potent in the picture today is not so much what might offend by way of what\\'s revealed in the sex or nudity- the director/\"actor\" Vilgot Sjoman films the various scenes in such a way that there is an abundance of flesh and genitalia and the occasional graphic bit but it\\'s always more-so an intellectual expression than very lust-like- but the daring of the attempt at a pure \\'metafilm\\' while at the same time making a true statement on the state of affairs in Sweden. Who knew such things in a generally peaceful country (i.e. usually neutral in foreign affairs and wars) could be so heated-up politically? At least, that\\'s part of Sjoman\\'s aim here. <br /><br />Like a filmmaker such as Dusan Makavajev with some of his works like W.R. (if not as surreal and deranged) or to a slightly lesser extent Bertolucci, Sjoman is out to mix politics and sex (mostly politics and social strata) around in the midst of also making it a comment on embodying a character in a film. The two characters, Lena and Borje, have a hot-cold relationship in the story of the film, where Lena is a \"curious\" socialist-wannabe who demonstrates in the street for nonviolence and \\'trains\\' sort of in a cabin in the woods to become a fully functioning one, while at the same time maybe too curious about her car salesman boyfriend. And as this is going on, which is by itself enough for one movie, Sjoman inserts himself and his crew from time to time as they are making this story on film (there\\'s even a great bit midway through where, as if at a rock concert, title cards fill in during a break in shooting who the crew are, negating having to use end credits!) Then with this there\\'s a whole other dynamic as Sjoman gives an actual performance, not just a \"hey, I\\'m the director playing the director\" bit.<br /><br />At first, one might not get this structure and that I am Curious (Yellow) is just a film where Lena is a documentary interviewer asking subjects about their thoughts on class, socialism, Spain and Franco, and once in a while we see Lena\\'s father or Bjore. But Sjoman does something interesting: the structure is so slippery as the viewer one has to stay on toes; it\\'s impressive that so many years on a picture can surprise with not being afraid to mix dramatic narrative, documentary, film-within-a-film, and even a serious interview with Martin Luther King, who also acts as a quasi-guru for Lena. It might not always be completely coherent analysis politically, but it doesn\\'t feel cheating or even with much of a satirical agenda like in a Godard picture; the satire Sjoman is after is akin to a Godard but on a whole other wavelength. His anarchy is playful but not completely loaded with semantics or tricks that could put off the less initiated viewer.<br /><br />If I Am Curious (Yellow) stands up as an intellectual enterprise and a full-blown trip into exploring sex in a manner that was and is captivating for how much is shown and how comfortable it all seems to be for the actors, it isn\\'t entirely successful, I think, as an emotional experience. Where Bergman had it down to a T with making a purely emotional film with deconstruction tendencies, Sjoman is more apt at connecting with specific ideas while not actually directing always very well when it comes time to do big or subtle scenes with the actors. Occasionally it works if only for the actors, Lena Nyman (mostly spectacular here in a performance that asks of her to make an ambitious but confused kid into someone sympathetic and vulnerable even) and Borje Ahlstedt (a great realistic counterpoint to the volatile Lena), but some 40 years later its hard to completely connect with everything that happens in the inner-film of Lena and Borje since (perhaps intentionally) Sjoman fills it up with clichés (Borje has a girlfriend and kid, will he leave her, how will Lena reconcile her father) and a heavy-handed narration from his starlet of sorts.<br /><br />And yet, for whatever faults Sjoman may have, ironically considering he means it to be a comment on itself, I Am Curious (Yellow) holds up beautifully as an artistic experiment in testing the waters of what could be done in Swedish cinema, or testing what couldn\\'t be and bending it for provocative and comedic usage. I\\'d even go as far as to say it\\'s influential, and has probably been copied or imitated in more ways than one due to it being such a cult phenomenon at its time (a specific technique used, with the film rewinding towards the end, is echoed in poorer usage in Funny Games), and should be seen by anyone looking into getting into avant-garde or meta-film-making. If it\\'s not quite as outstanding an artistic leap as W.R. or Last Tango, it\\'s close behind.',\n"," \"This is a documentary I came across by chance on the UK TV channel More4 and I have to say I found it extremely interesting and thought provoking.

The argument he presents was new to me and argued about how the fortune of the right crops and the right animals that where able to domesticated is certainly a compelling one. As for the documentary itself it is well shot and well narrated with not to much of the re-created scenes that spoil many a modern documentary. Diamond also helps by not being to condescending which is a fault of a lot of intellectuals when trying to get a message to the masses. People have claimed his theory is Marxist but I do not buy this and see it more socio geologist. It was also refreshing to hear an theory on the evolution of society not based around religion.

The Europeans are well known for putting an emphasis on sex and nudity over actual scares in their horror films, but this one here is just a bit too much. \"Werewolf Woman\" seems to have a sleazy sex scene copped off with the title character going crazy and brutally killing her partner. Fun the first few times, but a hundred minutes of this becomes very monotonous quickly. Shes not even a werewolf, but a schizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy. The film can\\'t even decide its tone, with the first ten minutes (a flashback) being legitimate supernatural horror (I thought I was in for a trash classic after these) to a rather poor character study of the female being repeatedly abused and tortured to a revenge thriller. At the end, the director insists this is based on a true story. Yeah, all right.<br /><br />To be fair, there are a few entertaining aspects of the production. The title werewolf woman is a looker and there are a few nice gore effects and nude scenes. However, these become rather monotonous quickly. Also, the dubbed dialog is pretty hilarious in a camp fashion, especially the worlds most swinging doctor (he drinks on the job). Unfortunately, the film becomes pretty irritating fast. There\\'s no actual plot or anything else really. Its a shame, because reading a description I felt the film had some real potential. \"Werewolf Woman\" is far overlong, slow moving, and a bit too pointless, even by the standards of the exploitation genre.

But, sadly, I am in the minority I guess when it comes to the Cinematic Stephen King. As brilliant as King\\'s writing is, the irony is that it simply doesn\\'t translate well to the screen, big or small. With few exceptions (very few), the King experience cannot be filmed with the same impact that the stories have when read. Many people would disagree with this, but I\\'m sure that in their heart of hearts they have to admit that the best filmed King story is but a pale memory of the one they read. The reason is simple. The average King story takes place in the mind-scape of the characters in the story. He gives us glimpses of their inner thoughts, their emotions and their sometimes fractured or unreal points of view. In short, King takes the reader places where you can\\'t put a Panavision camera. As an audience watching the filmed King, we\\'re left with less than half the information than the reader has access to. It\\'s not too far a stretch to claim that One becomes a character in a King story they read, whereas One is limited to petty voyeurism of that same character when filmed. For as long as King writes, Hollywood will try shooting everything that comes out of his word processor, without any regard to whether or not they should. I don\\'t blame the filmmakers for trying, but it takes an incredible amount of talent and circumspection to pull off the elusive Stephen King adaptation that works. The task is akin to turning lead into gold, or some arcane Zen mastery. Oh well, better luck next time.',\n"," 'First off, I have to say that I really like the idea of Rock-a-Doodle. The basic story of the rooster having to save his farm from eternal darkness and rain by crowing the sun up could have made for such a great movie. But I feel that, as it was, it wasn\\'t nearly as good a movie as it could have been.<br /><br />A huge part of my problem with this movie was the main character, Edmund. This kid/cat is so darn annoying. His speech impediment got very old very fast, and it just felt like he was trying way too hard to sound cute. Also, as another reviewer pointed out earlier, he belabored to death the fact that he was \"too little\" to do pretty much anything, which became irritating.<br /><br />It was also bothersome that this movie couldn\\'t decide whether it wanted to be a full-blown musical or not. The Chanticleer/King songs were fine, because they were part of the whole singing rooster story. But it seemed that the other random songs were pretty unnecessary. The owls\\' songs were bad enough, but did they really feel the need to have the bit with the bouncer toads\\' song?? These random musical numbers felt like they came out of some particularly bad Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. If they really wanted to make this movie a musical, they needed to have some real full-length songs instead of those short musical snippets given to the villains.<br /><br />But by far, my biggest problem with this movie is that it\\'s just not very good at storytelling. It was fine that Patou (Phil Harris in his last role!) narrated the story. However, at times, they relied too much on the narration to tell us things instead of showing us. This is especially true in the whole Goldie subplot. Patou told us that a) Goldie was a lot smarter and nicer than she seemed at first and b) that she was really falling for Chanticleer although she was only supposed to fake it. It really would have helped Goldie\\'s character development if there had been scenes where she was gradually acting smarter and nicer. And the movie would instantly have been better, I believe, if there had been a scene showing the moment where Goldie knew that she was in love with Chanticleer for real instead of just having narration. As it was, it felt like Goldie was just tacked onto the movie so that Chanticleer could have a love interest.<br /><br />There\\'s a good movie somewhere in Rock-a-Doodle. And I won\\'t deny that it was a special part of many people\\'s childhoods. However, for the reasons above (as well as others I don\\'t care to bore you with), it just didn\\'t live up to that potential, and turned out to be just another mediocre-to-bad kids\\' movie.',\n"," \"!!! Spoiler alert!!!<br /><br />The point is, though, that I didn't think this film had an ending TO spoil...

That alone blew me away. Then I bought the 2 LP soundtrack before the movie came out and listened to it over and over. By the time the movie premiered, I was more than ready for it. It showed for two weeks at a local theater and I saw it once a day every day for two weeks. I really had no life! I ordered the VHS tape sometime in the 80\\'s and paid $60 for it.

Their purpose is to excite interest in the upcoming film, thus \"possessing\" you to spend $10 to go see it. I\\'m okay with this concept! BUT, I expect my reaction of the preview to at least somewhat resemble my reaction to the movie. \"Possession\\'s\" preview describes an amazing journey into the depths of love, transcending time, making Shakespeare look like the writer of \"Not Another Teen Movie\", and uses Enya to further add atmosphere to the scene, with her chilling emotional sound, filling your stomach with a mixture of magic, desire, and most importantly a NEED to see the movie. So I did, and what I got was a plot as riveting as dust, with a love (for lack of a better word) story as romantic as a date with the pope. Not even the acting was able to redeem the nightmare!

Here in the Age of Innocence, Scorsese depicts (with the help of Edith Wharton's novel) of a time in New York when things when things were elegant, though also brutal in the deep. Daniel Day Lewis plays a man who is torn between marrying a woman he likes (Winona Ryder) and making her family happy as well, or choosing a tempting woman with a free mind (Michelle Pfieffer). This could sound like Arthur in the 19th century, but the director handles the material so carefully it works very well along with fine performances and excellent photography by long time collaborator Michael Ballhaus (who also provided my favorite scene in movies in the Cobana long shot in GoodFellas). One of the best films of 1993. A+\",\n"," 'I am so sorry I wasted 6.00 dollars for this DVD. The selling and promotional materials seemed to indicate it was something of an artful classic.

This is either bad acting, bad script, but in fact it was both.<br /><br />I cannot waste the kilowatt hours to see this sad flick again. Ron Howard did himself no favors by attaching his name to this dog.<br /><br />I mean from the get go, the script was so simplistic and hollow. At times Cate Blanchett changed her phony drawl and driveled moronic script lines, while he uneducated Indian father sounded as if he held a PhD. \" I think they were abused\"... what you say?<br /><br />Bad bad bad.<br /><br />and more bad !',\n"," \"Most horror movies are in fact horrible movies. They get to be same ol'-same ol'. Same ol' pack every minute with some cheap thrill (usually 'splatter') and nowadays they can pack every second with gaudy special effects. One of the goals of a really good horror flick is to suspend the sense of disbelief of the audience. For instance, I saw both of the recent Mummy movies and nearly got dizzy viewing ridiculous special effects every second. It probably costs a million dollars per second to make those movies and my sense of disbelief was never suspended, it grew roots.<br /><br />Subtlety can be more terrifying. Less is more. <br /><br />I first saw 'The Woman in Black' on the A&E channel. After flipping through the usual 987 channels of very bad television I stopped to watch it. This movie almost has the feel of a 'Masterpiece Theater' production. That was fine with me, I've always preferred British TV & movies anyway.<br /><br />Most viewers would find this to be too slowly paced. But the slow pacing helps give the story credibility. The special effects are few which lulls the viewer into thinking that this film is set in the real world thus making us a bit more uneasy. The makeup and costume for the ghost are kept simple and believable. Hollywood would have made her look like a she demon from hell with glowing eyes-fangs-claws etc. Hollywood would have done an overkill and turned this idea into a mediocrity.<br /><br />The woman only makes about five appearances in the film. Most of them are where she appears in the distance and even that creates a good fright. If she appeared too often, it could've cheapened the mood that gets set. However this movie is so well made that through much of the film we're led into sensing that she is there the whole time but not visible. The scene where she 'visits' Arthur Kidd late at night and we see her just a little too close is a masterpiece in horror.<br /><br />This is just an extraordinary film that I think should rate as one the finest horror films ever made. I have a copy of 'The Haunting', 'The Changling' and a zillion more. I haven't seen anything that tops 'The Woman in Black' yet although I'm still looking. This movie is so well made that it gives even the most hardened skeptic (like me) a moment where I almost had second thoughts about the non-existence of ghosts. I joke to people that I occasionally get brief fears that she could appear standing in the middle of the road or that I'd see her staring through my window, etc. Maybe she could be in a crowd at the mall glaring at me with her look of hate. This is how a really great horror film should be. Like a LaFanu novel, The Woman in Black very slowly pulls you in and wraps herself around your neck and before you realize it, she's squeezing the life out of you and then it's too late.<br /><br />Closest thing I have to a criticism is that this was made for the small screen... and it's a terrible shame that this is out of print. I just paid over $40 for my second copy of this movie. It's a major prize in my collection. Now I'm on a quest to find an even better horror movie that not only gives the chills but also qualifies a sound drama.\",\n"," 'I thought that this movie was going to be totally lame based on the advertisements that I saw in theaters. When my sister borrowed from a friend I decided to watch it because it was summer and there was nothing else to do. . .needless to say ten minutes in the movie and I loved it. Amanda was a great actor in the movie, her comedic timing was perfect. The guy who played Duke was hot, plain and simple. My favorite scene was definitely when Amanda walks by the gardener and a fellow student who is suspicious of her and she is talking to her mom about dresses--as she is pretending to be a guy! I re-watched this part over and over... to make a long story short, the movie I thought was going to be lame--I now own it.',\n"," 'I just watched this movie for the second time, and enjoyed it as much as the first time.

Its great to see that Lau can still hold a kung fu fight sequence after around 40 years in the business. Jacky Wu also shows how he has progressed since Tai-Chi Boxer.<br /><br />The story keeps with the traditional kung fu themes, its great fun to watch and reminds one of what the Hong Kong film industry earned its name from.

There are reasons why some movies go straight-to-video; the utter predictability, laughably clichéd scenes and obvious subplots intended to lengthen the film are these reasons. Ray Liotta\\'s intensity at the beginning should have been capitalized upon, but he loses it halfway through. The movie has all the earmarks of being rewritten as it was being shot.<br /><br />Some observations: What purpose does it serve to have TWO people gunning for the Ray Liotta character? The corrupt warden and \"Russian mafia\" hit-man contribute nothing to the storyline and could easily have been left out. The avenging brother would have been enough, and was not fleshed out. Liotta showing remorse, trying to befriend and help the man he shot and crippled, beginning to live a normal life, only to have the angry brother whose life was ruined bent on revenge.... now that could have been a good movie.<br /><br />Do we really need to know the Dafoe character\\'s personal life? What does this contribute? The way he tells the story of his murdered son should be shown to acting students as an example of bad \"mailing it in\" acting. \"He looked up at me and said, I\\'ll be alright Dad... and then he died.\" This only exists to prop up the cheesy end scene, which should never have been included. A better ending would be to have Liotta die, and that\\'s it! Gee, the undercover guys driving around in a large dark colored van. How original. And the pursuers all driving identical black sedans. Not original at all... and the \"blood dripping on the shoulder\" flashback scene was shown far too often. Gotta justify that CGI expenditure, I suppose.<br /><br />Why were the drugs taken as pills? Why not injections to make SURE? Why was the doctor allowed to go into Liotta\\'s cell where he could be easily attacked? How is it that Defoe was beaten by Liotta the first time, but the second time Dafoe suddenly gets fighting skills and beats Liotta to a pulp? <br /><br />Ah, there is plenty more to pick at, but to save time, stay away from this one.',\n"," 'This is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it. That would be fine if the film were a travelogue, but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry, that is not good enough. The theme of inter-species respect and co-operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter-species love, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species.

And, after seeing this movie twice, I have come to the conclusion that this movie wasn\\'t so terrible. \"But it has such a low rating! You\\'re just not an easy critic!\" No I am not. I consider myself to be very harsh. In some of my other reviews I have bombarded movies to no end with my opinions. I simply feel that a movie should automatically be voted so low merely because it was shown on MST 3K. On the IMDB scale of 1-10, I gave this movie a three (3) and here\\'s why.<br /><br />This movie has a decent plot. No, the plot\\'s not the journey of Tee to the lost cellar, it\\'s not the victories over Lord Voltaire and it\\'s definitely not the Delta Knights attempting to bring about the New Renaissance (they could have done that years before if they hadn\\'t waited for Tee to come around). This movie\\'s decent plot was the back story of how the lost storehouse came to be, through their inventions and writings of Archimedes and the technology of the lost continent Atlantis. That is where the story induces interest into me. I think it\\'s interesting to have a story where Leonardo da Vinci was really a thief of good ideas and Archimedes was the real genius. It\\'s a new twist on old facts, and therefore it deserves some credit. I think if this movie had more of a budget, it could have been made into a very decent picture. <br /><br />The MST3K viewing of this movie produced two of the funniest quotes I have ever heard from the show. Both quotes came from the scene where Baydool comes out of the bathroom holding his pan of pee and Pearl exclaims \"Ewwww! Wizard wiz...\" I think the house shook I was laughing so hard. But then, not five seconds later, he threw his urine on the guy trying to steal Tee and Baydool makes the goofiest and Tom says \"That\\'s my pee!\" After that I lost it. I was rolling on the floor, stuffing my face into my pillow trying to muffle my laughter. Boy those two quotes really made that one episode worth watching because most of the stuff after that wasn\\'t really that great. I would actually prefer to watch the movie without Mike, Tom and Crow and make my own jokes instead of having the show tell me what\\'s funny about the movie. I would much rather use my own humor to make my own jokes to degrade this movie.<br /><br />All-in-all, I think you people judged this movie too harshly. A movie being on MST3K doesn\\'t necessarily qualify it for being a terrible movie.

I am actually being very kind in my criticisms.<br /><br />I find that when a movie is poorly written no manner of great acting can save it, not that there was any great acting in \"Contagion.\" The writing and dialogue were stilted and hackneyed. This movie explains why the writer hasn\\'t done anything after writing it. There was no believability in the storyline at some points.

The film fades out as they take a very spectacular magic carpet ride away from the city of Baghdad.<br /><br />The film strongly excels artistically. The city appears huge and grand and generally very real. The special effects are also top notch. Fairbanks is also incredible with his athletic prowess as he effortlessly climbs ropes, battles silly looking monsters (the only minor drawback among the many special effects) and leaps about the scenery. About the only other minor negative is that occasionally, Fairbanks' performance is perhaps TOO Athletic--as he didn't do quite a convincing job with the love scenes and quieter moments in the film. Still, it's a silent masterpiece.\",\n"," 'Thumb Tripping is a little-known hippie road movie made in 1972. It\\'s little-known for a reason. The reason is that it is somewhat poor.... and those who saw it (of which there were few) did not build for it a word-of-mouth reputation of any note. There are a few cast members in it who went on to bigger and better things, notably Meg Foster and Bruce Dern; also the director Quentin Masters would later score a sexploitation hit with the Joan Collins movie The Stud. However, in this film there is very little of interest other than a freewheeling narrative that offers occasional insights into the permissive and casual attitudes of the youth of the late \\'60s/early \\'70s. In most departments, Thumb Tripping is a tedious, dated, muddled and totally forgettable misfire.<br /><br />Young hitch-hikers Gary (Michael Burns) and Chay (Meg Foster) make their way around California together, hitching rides when they can and spending evenings under the stars. Gary is a kid from a decent background and a home in Connecticut who has chosen to postpone going to college in order to \"discover himself\"; Chay is a more freewheeling type who just wants to experience the here-and-now while she is still young. During their wanderings, Gary and Chay come across various weird types and sometimes find themselves caught up in bizarre adventures. They\\'re picked up by road-racers Smitty (Bruce Dern) and Simp (Larry Hankin) who threatens them with a switchblade; later they hitch a lift from an embittered woman (Joyce Van Patten) who has hated hippies since her daughter ran away to become one; another time Chay finds herself being ogled by a middle-aged trucker (Mike Conrad); and in their final \"thumb trip\", they find themselves travelling with dysfunctional husband-and-wife alcoholics (Mariana Hill and Burke Burns).<br /><br />The episodes come and go without leaving much of an impression, partly due to the fuzzy soundtrack (which renders much of the dialogue inaudible) and partly because of the thoroughly uninteresting main characters. Michael Burns gives a non-performance that may one day be recommended by doctors as a cure for insomnia, while Foster fares little better as a dislikable female lead whose character seems to think she\\'s free and happy but in reality is just a self-centred slut. The gallery of background characters are far more fascinating than these two, but they come and go too quickly to make much of an impact. The script (by Don Mitchell, from his own novel) has no idea where it\\'s going and merely ambles along from one pointless situation to another. Where Easy Rider was similarly plot less and freewheeling, at least it had interesting characters and situations, and charismatic performers. Thumb Tripping has none of that and is a very tough film to endure from low-key beginning to unsatisfying end.',\n"," \"I just saw Jamaica Inn (1939) and was shocked to find it right at home at any exploitation film fest. While it was directed by Hitchcock, it doesn't feel like a Hitchcock movie at all, and the true auteurs of the film are the dialogue writer (separate from screenplay writer in the credits), Sidney Gilliat, and the star, who is also the villain, Charles Laughton. The dialogue seemed straight out of A Clockwork Orange, as if both films take place in the same alternate universe. One character in particular sounded like one of Alex's droogs. Coupled with this fantastic dialogue was one of my top ten favorite villains in movie history. Charles Laughton chewed the #$*! out of the scenery in this role, with better-than-perfect comic timing and a villainous role straight out of an exploitation film. While not technically an exploitation film, I think you could only get into it by watching it in the same way you would watch an exploitation film, otherwise you probably wouldn't 'get it' and think it was just some early undeveloped Hitch film. For example, I thought the last 10 minutes or so of Laughton kidnapping Maureen O'Hara's character was just a 1930's metaphorical way of filming an exploitation rape scene. Just watch the way Laughton does the most insanely despicable things and seems to have the most blasé and yet innocently boyish fun doing it. Play this in the middle of a triple bill of 1970's exploitation films and it would feel right at home. Probably the only way to watch it. Viewing this instead as most people do, as Hitchcock-in-development, will probably only lead to disappointment, as can be seen from other user comments.\",\n"," 'I am so disappointed in this movie I can\\'t express it. I was so excited when I started watching this film to see Mickey Rourke all leather faced and that kid from Third Rock From The Sun acting like I psycho. I thought, wow, this is going to be a winner, freakin\\' Natural Born Killers style. And it got better. The production value was great, the directing was great, the acting was great, the cinematography was great, and the plot was, well, the plot, well, what WHAT PLOT? About half way through this film I was pulling my hair out yelling \"What the hell is going on?\" and I mean that quite literally? Nothing makes any sense whatsoever. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Aaaaaaahhhhhhggg!!!!',\n"," 'Uta Hagen\\'s \"Respect for Acting\" is the standard textbook in many college theater courses. In the book, Hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor: the Presentational approach, and the Representational approach. In the Presentational approach, the actor focuses on realizing the character as honestly as possible, by introducing emotional elements from the actor\\'s own life. In the Representational approach, the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion, through a high degree of control of movement and sound.<br /><br />The Representational approach to acting was still partially in vogue when this Hamlet was made. British theater has a long history of this style of acting, and Olivier could be said to be the ultimate king of the Representational school.<br /><br />Time has not been kind to this school of acting, or to this movie. Nearly every working actor today uses a Presentational approach. To the modern eye, Olivier\\'s highly enunciated, stylized delivery is stodgy, stiff and stilted. Instead of creating an internally conflicted Hamlet, Olivier made a declaiming, self-important bullhorn out of the melancholy Dane -- an acting style that would have carried well to the backs of the larger London theaters, but is far too starchy to carry off a modern Hamlet.<br /><br />And so the movie creaks along ungainfully today. Olivier\\'s tendency to e-nun-ci-ate makes some of Hamlet\\'s lines unintentionally funny: \"In-stead, you must ac-quire and be-get a tem-purr-ance that may give it... Smooth-ness!\" Instead of crying at meeting his father\\'s ghost (as any proper actor could), bright fill lights in Olivier\\'s pupils give us that impression.<br /><br />Eileen Herlie is the only other actor of note in this Hamlet, putting in a good essay at the Queen, despite the painfully obvious age differences (he was 41; she was 26). The other actors in this movie have no chance to get anything else of significance done, given Olivier\\'s tendency to want to keep! the camera! on him! at all! times! <br /><br />Sixty years later, you feel the insecurity of the Shakespearean stage actor who lacked the confidence to portray a breakable, flawed Hamlet, and instead elected to portray a sort of Elizabethan bullhorn. Final analysis: \"I would have such a fellow whipped for o\\'er-doing Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.\"',\n"," \"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!<br /><br />This beautiful, charming love story drew me in immediately with its lovable characters and heart-warming romance. I became so attached to the characters throughout the film that I felt as if I knew them personally. The storyline is very enchanting, and it brought me to tears in several touching moments. Duchovny and Driver have a very cute, chaste relationship that you can't help getting involved in. This one's worth watching more than once, and showing to all your friends. I'm just curious, why wasn't this a big hit?<br /><br />I give this a 10 out of 10! Spectacular film!

This however seems to have passed completely over the makers, who have provided us instead with an admittedly prettily photographed film that conveys nothing of the book. It's difficult of course to compress it into the space of two hours, but at least they might have tried. As it is the plot is sadly garbled; I doubt that anyone who had not read the book (or at least a synopsis of it) would make head or tail of what was going on, and anyone who has read the book would be completely baffled by the cavalier discarding of key elements of the book. What is unmistakably a 20th century cast with 20th century manners dresses up and romps through it as a bodice ripper, completely missing the point that it's meant to be a study of social power structures breaking down in 18th century England.

Tottenham are in town already.. they\\'re part of the town, they don\\'t have to go there! And if Tottenham fans wanted to fight other fans the last place on earth they\\'d do it is Bank station, where there are probably more security cameras than anywhere else in the world.<br /><br />There are several other similar errors but the biggest failing for me is the actor who plays the lead hooligan. He clearly decided it wasn\\'t worth trying to speak with an East End accent and instead opted for a Dick Van Dyke style mock-ney which made my ears bleed.

The Orphanage is the first film from director Juan Antonio Bayona and was produced by his long-time friend Guillermo Del Toro, director of my film of last year, Pan's Labyrinth.<br /><br />The Orphanage tells the story of Laura who returns to the abandoned orphanage where she was raised in order to re-open it as a home for children with disabilities. Along with her husband and adopted son Simon who is HIV Positive, she prepares the orphanage to receive its new residents but all is not as it seems, and steadily the sins of the past begin to resurface through a series of ghostly happenings.<br /><br />A solid old-fashioned ghost story that is genuinely frightening without resorting to lashings of gore or cheap shocks, The Orphanage is the best horror film of 2007 so far and certainly shows Hollywood the true definition of suspense after the laughable '1408'.

Abingdon is two and a hour hours from where I live, but the trip was worth it in every sense of the word. UZAK/DISTANT is an amazing, brilliant, jarring, emotional, captivating film. As a Turkish-American, this film was not only a testimony as to what life in Turkey is like; but on a larger scale it tells the world of what it is like to be Turkish whether one lives in Istanbul, Berlin, Montreal, New York, or Omaha. It may be two hours in length as opposed to five minutes, but this is effectively our Bob Marley song. There are so many wonderful scenes in this film. It is very difficult to choose just a random few. But, for me, one telling scene takes place in a Beyoglu (downtown Istanbul) cinema. The title character, played by Mehmet Emin Toprak who sadly died in a car accident shortly after this film\\'s completion, follows a very attractive young woman down a staircase to the cinema\\'s main auditorium. She goes into see \"Vanilla Sky.\" As the image of Tom Cruise is reflected from a glass, we sense that Turkish men are competing with Tom Cruise for their own women\\'s affections even though Tom Cruise is nowhere to found in Beyoglu. The scenes shot across the Bosphorous shores are also quite revealing as they symbolize the beauty, yet desperate empty gulfs, which are a painful fact of life in Turkey. In this film, the gulf separates lovers and families. A simple, empty packet of Samsun (Turkish brand) cigarettes and a dying mouse jump off the screen the way seagulls did in the 1982 Serif Goren-Yilmaz Guney film \"Yol.\" Many of Guney\\'s films, including \"Yol,\" \"Suru- the Herd\" (1978- completed by Zeki Okten) and \"Baba-The Father\" (1971) have been considered by many to be the best Turkish films ever made. Without Guney\\'s sometimes overblown social-political anger (especially in his last film, the 1983 prison drama \"Duvar-The Wall\"), \"Distance\" captures the essence of Turkish life quite remarkably.

I thus sat down to watch this movie with great eagerness... and was utterly disappointed by the end.<br /><br />The first 3/4 of the movie can best be described as uninspired and poorly directed (sorry, Ade!), but with some utterly brilliant moments. Unfortunately, these laugh-out-loud moments make you realize how less-than-brilliant the rest of the movie is. The slapstick starts off funny but eventually becomes a bit boring, with only the perverted sex jokes to keep things humorous.<br /><br />The end of the movie (the 'green' scenes, for those of you who've seen it) was... perhaps the worst ending I've seen in the past decade. Honestly. It was one joke repeated about thirty times, followed by an abrupt ending that made no sense (which didn't bother me) and wasn't funny (which did).<br /><br />To sum up, I was sorely disappointed by this movie. I shall cling to the few brilliant moments in it, to retain the fondest memories that I can... but I have to warn you, if you're about to overpay for your NTSC conversion tape from the local importer, don't. There are far better things to spend your money on.\",\n"," \"This is a movie about a man everybody thinks is Jewish.This is a movie about Lawrence Newman, who lives in Brooklyn in the 1940's, at the time of WWII.One day, when he gets himself glasses, people start thinking he's a Jew.And that only, because he looks like one.And he lives in a very antisemitic neighborhood.So some people start treating him like dirt.They make that judgment, being a Jew, of Larry's fresh wife, Gertrude Hart, too.That makes their lives unbearable.Neal Slavin's Focus (2001) is a fairly good look at the antisemitism.That's a problem that won't go away.The movie is based on Athur Miller's novel, which, I admit, I haven't read.But the movie is really good, so I'm sure the book would also.The actors do good job.William H.Macy is always good, and his work as Larry Newman is brilliant.Laura Dern is Gert Hart and she's magnificent.Meat Loaf is almost scary as the neighbor who wants to keep Jews out by any means necessary.David Paymer's character as the Jewish shop-owner Mr. Finkelstein is the most sympathetic in the movie.Paymer is the perfect choice for the role.One of the greatest scenes is in the end when Mr.Finkelstein and Newman fight against those Nazi-like people with baseball bats.They join together to fight the evil.The Christian and the Jew.\",\n"," '\"One Frightened Night\" is the story of an old man who invites his relatives to come to dinner and discuss his will.

Well, the granddaughter arrives in the nick of time, however, then another young woman shows up claiming to be the granddaughter. When the first young woman is found dead in her bedroom, a classic murder mystery ensues. This is one of the less known murder-mysteries of the 30\\'s, but it is still very good.

Some decent actors are largely wasted in this pale sci-fi tale.

The movie follows Julia Jones (Alyson Hannigan) as she goes through all the events that take place in order to marry her prince Grant (Adam Campbell). This process involves meeting the parents, breaking up, meeting the ex-girlfriend, planning the wedding and everything else that the romantic comedy genre has thrown our way. Laughs are supposed to ensue\\x85 <br /><br />Just when you thought Hollywood has reached an all time low comes \"Date Movie,\" a movie that proves that anything can be made into a film in Hollywood and no matter how bad something is people will dish out their hard earned money to see it. \"Date Movie\" is by far the worst pile of crap I have seen in several years and can possibly go down in the history of film as being one of the worst movies ever made.<br /><br />This movie contained zero laughs, none of the spoofs were even remotely funny. It was an insult to anyone who dished out any kind of money to see this film. The saddest part about all of this is that I knew before seeing this movie that it was going to be bad but I didn\\'t think it could ever be as bad as it actually was. All the jokes fell flat and half way through its groundbreaking 75 minute running time I wanted to find a way to end my life so I wouldn\\'t have to sit through another second of this horrid movie.<br /><br />There really isn\\'t a positive thing I can say about this movie. The first question that comes to mind though is who the hell came up with the idea. Why spoof comedies? Comedies are already funny so why spoof them? This is a question I wondered when I first heard about the movie and now after seeing \"Date Movie\" I know it can\\'t be done and shouldn\\'t even be attempted. While \"Date Movie\" only runs 75 minutes they try to spoof everything they can including Bridget Jones\\'s Diary, Kill Bill, Say Anything, My Best Friend\\'s Wedding, Napoleon Dynamite, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Hitch, The Bachelor, Meet the Parents, Sleepless in Seattle, Rize, King Kong, Wedding Planner and so many more. You would think that one joke would work but in all honesty not a single one did. You just sit there staring at the screen, losing your brain cells, and wondering how on earth someone got money to produce this pile of garbage.<br /><br />I guess you should know that a movie is really bad when it\\'s not screened for critics and the trailer tries to sell you a movie by saying \"from 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie\" but there is always that small part of me that says it can\\'t be as bad as it looks but in this case it\\'s worse than it looks. It\\'s a train wreck and if anyone finds this movie funny I am sorry but there must be something seriously wrong with you or you are just so incredibly immature.<br /><br />This movie took 2 people to write and two people to direct. If I ever meet Jason Friedberg or Aaron Seltzer the writers and directors behind this crap I will demand that they give me my $6.75 back for paying to see this movie. These guys have no right what so ever to make a movie when they put out a movie like \"Date Movie.\" There should be a law in Hollywood that if your movie is hated by both critics and audiences alike that you should be placed in a cell and beaten until you write everyone who watched your film a huge letter of apology. I really wonder what crap can come out of Hollywood next that can be worse than this film.<br /><br />So to sum it up, \"Date Movie\" sucks, plain and simple. Even if you see it with little or no expectations you will be disappointed. I despise everyone who was involved with this movie from the entire cast who somehow read this script and said this is going to be good to the interns who didn\\'t walk off the set after the first day of shooting. Why is it that we have to suffer through movies that are this bad? And Hollywood wonders why ticket sales are going down because when you pay $6-$10 to see a movie like \"Date Movie\" I can totally understand why people aren\\'t going and would be leery of what Hollywood puts out. This is the worst film to come out of Hollywood in years even worse than \"Gigli,\" \"Batman and Robin\" and \"You Got Served.\" <br /><br />MovieManMenzel\\'s final rating for \"Date Movie\" is a 0 out of ten. This movie doesn\\'t even deserve a 1 because nothing worked at all and people shouldn\\'t have to be tortured like this when they see a movie.',\n"," \"Plankton, or Creatures from the Abyss as I'm positive it's more commonly known as & filmed under as the title Creatures from the Abyss appears over a moving image & in the same font type as the rest of the credits, starts with five 20 something kids, Mike (Clay Rogers) his girlfriend Margaret (Sharon Twomey), sisters Julie (Ann Wolf) & Dorothy (Loren DePalm) & an annoying idiot named Bobby (Michael Bon) whom decide to all fit into a small rubber boat & head out to sea, don't ask why as I don't know. Oh & the complete idiot Bobby left the petrol behind & never thought to tell anyone so it comes as no great surprise that they end up stranded out at sea without any petrol for the motor & to make matters worse they become trapped in a thunder storm & discover a dead body floating in the water. Shortly after their luck seems to change when they come across a yacht & potential safety, in a flash everyone boards the yacht & begin to explore. First of all they find a scientific lab with various fish specimens & computer equipment, then down below they find fully furnished & luxurious cabins. They find a chemist (Deran Sarafian) who appears mad & can't talk. They eat fish from the fridge which makes Dorothy puke up green vomit, beetles & slugs. They learn that these fish are living fossil's 1000's of years old & have been contaminated by toxic waste dumped in the sea & that they fly, mutate, bite & are generally unpleasant to be around. I really can't be bothered to go on with this plot outline so I won't, here's what I think...<br /><br />This Italian production was produced & directed by Massimiliano Cerchi under the pseudonym Al Passeri (I'd hide under a different name if I made a film this bad too) & I think Plankton is quite simply one of the worst films ever, there are so many things wrong with this film it's difficult to know where to start. First the script by Richard Baumann is total crap, it makes no sense whatsoever & is so slow & dull it was torture for me to sit through. Why would five people just simply set sail for the middle of the ocean on a rubber dinghy barely big enough to fit them all in? What were they planning on doing exactly? Why do we often get point-of-view shots from these fish creatures but they seem to be totally invisible to the characters as they are never shown on screen even though they are right next to a character, & how do these fish get around the boat as there is no water for them to swim in? People's actions & reactions to things are all wrong, they constantly split up, they make bizarre decisions that simply don't make any sense in the situation they find themselves in & some of the dialogue is as awful as anything I've heard. I could go on all day about all the plot holes & ridiculous goings on but I'll run out of space if I do. The fish creatures themselves look awful, a mixture of rubbish rubber puppets & some really bad stop motion animation at the end, the scenes where they interact with the human cast also look terrible with some bad super imposition. I have heard a lot of comments saying that Plankton is gory, don't make me laugh! Forget it there is virtually no blood or gore in Plankton whatsoever, there are a couple of slimy scenes when Bobby transforms into a fish monster while having sex with Julie but it's pretty brief & he doesn't kill her, he just sort of drips slime on her, grows a couple of tentacles & a fish head comes out of his mouth. Later on Julie's vagina starts to drip some dark slime but that's it, we never get to actually see what happens to her or what the slime is. Dorothy has a fish creature come out of her back, off screen, & control her but again we never get to see what happens to her while Margaret commits suicide, a very brief shot of a plastic harpoon stuck to her forehead. Easily the grossest scene is when Dorothy pukes up that green stuff with what looks like beetles & slugs in it. That's it, only one person actually dies on screen & for the most part Plankton is quite tame & as exciting as watching paint dry & I nearly fell asleep it's so boring. I can't see how anybody can like this total crap, I just can't. The acting is awful, the dubbing is awful, the characters are awful & I hated all of them. Tecnically Plankton is predictably crap as well, with an estimated budget of only $250,000 all I can say is where did the money go? The sets are monotonous & dull with one lab & a few cabins, the special effect's are bottom of the barrel stuff including the most fake looking exploding boat ever, the cinematography is bland, the music sucks there is zero atmosphere or tension & as a whole Plankton, like it's name sake, is as low in the food chain as it could possibly be. I hate Plankton, it's awful in every single aspect of it's overlong 86 minute duration.

What makes this film so good is the touching of the human element.This film is definitely in the tradition of such British line classics such as \"Mrs. Miniver\" and \"Hope and Glory.\" As is the case with this film, we see the desperation of people in the time of war.<br /><br />The performances are outstanding here especially by the embittered John Thaw, who is assigned a child who has been evacuated from the London bombing.<br /><br />We soon see why this child wets his bed. He comes from a lunatic mother who has abused him terribly.<br /><br />The old man takes to the child and brings happiness into his sad life. When the child is returned to his mother, the old man goes to London and seeks him out only to find tragedy.

I can't stand Leelee Sobieski, seriously, ever since I saw Heaven on Earth, her face just, I can't describe it, she annoys the heck out of me.

Life is great for both siblings at first. However, Ruby soon discovers that her new foster parents are after the siblings' $4 million trust fund. Ruby discovers that the car her parents died in was a BMW loaned from the Glass' company and suspects that Mr. Glass was responsible for their deaths. Mrs. Glass watches an old home video of her and Ruby on a beach, happy and healthy. Then, overwhelmed with guilt, she overdoses and dies. Ruby wakes up the next morning with Mrs. Glass' dead body lying next to her. Shocked to find his wife dead, Mr. Glass traps Ruby and Rhett in the basement. Eventually, the two escape. After a brutal car accident due to Mr. Glass tampering with his own car in the same fashion as he did with the kids' parents.<br /><br />Honestly, this movie is just a waste of time, it's a very mediocre thriller that is, well for me at least, is just very predictable. The acting is lame as well as the story; but I will compliment the set, if you want me to give this movie a positive comment, there ya go. It's just a weak script, bad cast, and I can't wait to get this bad taste out of my mouth from this stupid movie, just writing this comment is making my health deteriorate.

What I got however was dreadful. In fact I would go as far to say that it was the worst historical drama I have seen on the screen. Worst ever screenplay Worst ever direction. The music is completely incongruous and sometimes played so loud that it drowns out the actors. In fact all the sound levels are totally off. Dreadful, dreadful acting in some places that even the likes of Alec Guinness cannot rise above. I would imagine that he cringed when he watched this for the first time. The lead character of Sarah Pickering playing Little Dorrit could not act if her head was on fire. It's embarrassing. It is amateur hour really and a very expensive waste of great actors like Jacobi and Guinness. Terrible limited sets that kept cropping up throughout. I mean, how many times can they use the bridge scene. I sat through the whole lot, but this movie is only fit for one thing, DELETION...\",\n"," 'A number of reviewers seemed to be blown away by this movie. I didn\\'t find it particularly \"brilliant,\" nor for that matter, very engaging. A middle-aged physician at a medical conference (away from his wife and family) begins a painfully halting flirtation with an attractive divorcée. Yet later, in a crowd scene, he grinds up against a nubile adolescent who turns out to be her daughter. This peculiar set of circumstances can\\'t go anywhere good and sure enough, it doesn\\'t. That in itself seems to provoke interest for some, but the pace is so slow that you get tired of waiting for things to gel and something significant to occur. As a result, most of the film felt unconnected and vaguely irrelevant. In fact, entire scenes could have been cut without affecting the story very much. In the last half hour, matters finally begin to coalesce, but other than an ironic set of tension-producing coincidences at the conclusion, there is really nothing new or unexpected here. In fact, it becomes disappointingly predictable, as if torn from the news. The biggest problem with having pretty Maria Alche\\' in the lead role is that she looks much older than the script indicates (she was 21 when the film was released) and is obviously not an innocent. It diminishes the sense of immorality(and probable illegality) surrounding the sexual advance made upon her by the physician when that sense is central to the premise and the concluding events.',\n"," \"Dean Martin plays the villain for the first time, but doesn't add any dimension to his role. George Peppard steals the movie as a gambler who doesn't want any trouble until situation becomes impossible. Jean Simmons is adorable as usual.<br /><br />The plots are quite routine, the action scenes passable. It's a bit unreasonable that Simmons would let Peppard, a stranger who rides to town on her stagecoach, stay in her house. Although such arrangement is made by the writers, it's a shame that their relationship is not fully developed.<br /><br />Fortunately we see some familiar supporting actors, including Don Galloway (of TV series IRONSIDE), John McIntire (of WAGON TRAIN), and it's interesting to watch comic actor Slim Pickens as mean, sadistic character again after his wonderful performance in ONE-EYED JACKS (1961).\",\n"," 'This movie is #1 on my all time worst movie list. Besides the fact that it has no plot, and that Joe Nameth is a mediocre actor at best; it is a western set to \"modern\" 1970\\'s music. Very strange.

My mom and I first saw this in the mid-1970\\'s and even back then, we joked that the name of the film should be \"Joe Nameth Goes to Mexico to Get Laid\". That is basically the entire plot.

It was exciting from shortly after the start till the very end! If you are a real suspense nut, this is the movie for you! The characters were very well developed and the scenery was beautiful.

This is supposed to be a chick flick; therefore it should have characters that are empowering to women. Instead this is filled with the weakest women this side of a sheiks harem. It is insulting to women and completely demeans them.<br /><br />Spoiler alert<br /><br />I was most surprised by Jennifer Garner\\'s character. For 7 seasons she played the strong kick ass Sydney Bristow, I would have thought she could spot a weak character. Also Jennifer\\'s character is hardly a starring role, but more of a prop ready to serve the wants of Matthew McConaughey\\'s character.<br /><br />We are lead to believe that Jennifer and Matthew were childhood sweethearts (that never kissed) who lost touch at 14 then reconnected at 24 when he not only breaks her heart but actually destroys her.<br /><br />He courts her, she falls for him, then after sex he bails and never speaks to her again. Years later he is the best man and she is the maid of honor at his brothers wedding. When she gets her first glimpse of him (after years of silence), she is all glassy eyed and love struck. The rest of the movie she pines for him. There is no big moment where she unleashes on him. There is no big moment where she realizes he is the one for her. She apparently has been waiting in the wings for him to realize she is the one.<br /><br />The character played by Lacey Chabert is a bridezilla who is unable to control herself and her emotions. Thankfully the three men in her life are there to knock sense back in her.<br /><br />The three bridesmaids are dimwits pining to sleep with Matthew and when that fails they scrape the bottom of the barrel groomsmen because they just need a man.<br /><br />The only strong female character is the mother of the bride played by Anne Archer. She goes toe to toe with Mathew and puts him in his place.<br /><br />But what is his place? Why is it assumed that a guy who lives life as a player lives an empty life? Matthew was blissfully enjoying his life until the ghosts started pointing out his flaws. And we all have flaws. Not like this guy was date raping girls.<br /><br />You could claim he mistreated women but he never hid that and the women in the movie like it, so he\\'s got their approval. He breaks up with 3 girls on a conference call in front of a fourth girl and after such a despicable act, the fourth girl still wants to sleep with him.<br /><br />In another scene he orders a bridesmaid to his room to prepare for sex, she happily obliges. Why does that make him flawed?<br /><br />Before the ghosts show up he is living a pretty happy life. He gets paid well, loves his job and he loves women. Later we learn that he lived to a ripe old age, so his antics never killed him.<br /><br />Speaking of his funeral, the scene is laughable. Only one person shows? Please! He was great at his job, a top fashion photographer, and was a hero to all the Players. His funeral would be filled with people.<br /><br />They try to portray him as a mean ass, because he supposedly gets drunk and shares his real feelings about marriage. The scene is out of his character. Prior to this he says with affection that he wouldn\\'t miss his little brothers wedding, now he\\'s saying mean things about the wedding to everyone? Remember this guy is a high paid professional photographer, he is not a stumbling drunk who just left his blue collar job on the loading docks.<br /><br />Then they try to make it seem like he ruined the wedding by telling one bridesmaid that another bridesmaid once slept with the groom. After the three bridesmaids discuss it, we\\'re dropped into a scene with a hysterical bride who just found out. Matthew was nowhere near that scene and couldn\\'t have told her, therefore one of the bridesmaids must have told her. So it was the bridesmaids that ruined the wedding NOT Matthew.<br /><br />Finally there is the photograph that he has apparently been caring in his wallet his whole life (yet it isn\\'t folded). Earlier the plot point of the photo is forced down our throat, in a way that negates the final reveal. With the ghost of the past, he sees himself as a child take the photo, he (as an adult) knows it\\'s in his pocket, so he\\'d be embarrassed about it and wouldn\\'t call attention to the child saying \"forever.\" Yet he does. Why? Oh yeah, to force the point down our throats.<br /><br />Oh and when he\\'s taking pictures at the wedding. The Nikon flash never pops up.

GANGS OF NEW YORK had some really extreme opinions from its audience ,a point reflected in the comments thrown at it on this site .I didn\\'t think it was as bad as my dad made out but like I said I could seewhere he was coming from <br /><br />My major problem with the movie is the screenplay . the opening shot sees Bill \" The Butcher \" Cutting kill Priest Vallon in front of his son who runs away swearing revenge for his dead father . From that point onwards we know that the story will end years later with a confrontation between the two protagonists so there\\'s no more dramatic twists for the story to take . Actually this in itself isn\\'t too bad but what spoils the story is the way it\\'s held up with the character interaction between Amsterdamn and Jenny Everdeane . Scorsese doesn\\'t do romantic interlude very well and this movie proves it . In amongst this diversion there\\'s something of a plot hole since Bill takes the young Amsterdamn under his wing even though he knows who he is . If you bumped off someones father in a street fight would you adopt their kids ? I didn\\'t think so <br /><br />This could have been an absolutely brilliant script and it is very good in places where we see how the gangs are structured , their ethnic mix and their political affiliations - Some are protestant with members who were born in America , some are catholic with many members born in Ireland , all are anglophobe and they all hate each other . We also see one of the most cynical episodes in American history where immigrants getting off ships at New York are immediately conscripted into the Union army unless they pay 300 dollars which eventually leads to the draft riots . When the movie concentrates on these parts of the plot it\\'s a great film but becomes heavily bogged down by the character subplots <br /><br />If Scorsese had directed this 20 years ago with a fraction of the budget he had here this could have been his masterwork but he seems to have overawed by riches . Everything is just a bit too grandiose and operatic to be entirely convincing . Charles Dickens had visited the five points and is recorded as saying it was the worst place on Earth . Scorsese makes the streets a little too clean , a little too Hollywood grunge , a little too glamorous in spite of everything . Leonardo Dicaprio is a very underrated actor held back by his startling good looks but he\\'s wrong as Amsterdamn and wasn\\'t right for the part which should have gone to an unknown . Cameron Diaz is totally unconvincing as Jenny and Scorsese could have easily given the part to a real life NY hooker while Daniel Day Lewis gives a powerhouse performance as Bill Cutting , however the role is slightly overplayed especially compared to Lewis\\'s other work <br /><br />Indeed everyone involved in GANGS OF NEW YORK in whatever capacity has done far better in other movies and at the end of the day this is a very unsatisfying flawed picture which received more nominations than it did prizes at award ceremonies , and I\\'m somewhat happy about that because this movie isn\\'t a crowning achievement for anyone , especially Martin Scorsese or Daniel Day Lewis who are capable of better things <br /><br />Seven out of Ten',\n"," 'Along with his turn in the super-sleazy \\'classic\\' THE TOOLBOX MURDERS (1978), this is considered the ultimate bad Cameron Mitchell horror effort. It\\'s a little too slow-moving for my tastes, has zero likable characters in it and not much action until the very end, but Mitchell\\'s dedicated central psycho performance as vengeance-minded whack-job Vincent Rinard is fun. Not Anthony Perkins good, mind you, but definitely fun enough. As a spoof of the shallow conceit that is Hollywood, it\\'s only so-so; as a horror movie it\\'s also only fair. And even as just a simple vintage exploitation picture, it\\'s just OK. I\\'m a big fan of the unnecessary gratuitous dance sequence, so I was also thankful for the appearance of the Gazzarri Dancers, who just rule. Five of them do a crazy hair-thrashin\\', floor-slidin\\', hip-shaking\\' go-go dance routine to \"Don\\'t Cry, Look For the Rainbow\" by the T-Bones. Watching these ladies bounce around with huge smiles on their faces in their fringe-covered bikini top and parachute pants ensemble is a defining reason why I give this a slightly higher rating that usual.<br /><br />Former movie make-up man Vincent Rinard (\"The best since Lon Chaney!\") goes after people at Paragon Studios. A flashback shows how Max Black (Berry Kroeger), a jealous and drunk studio executive, flung wine in Vinnie\\'s face right when he was about to light a smoke. He\\'s engulfed in flames and dives into a pool, but not before scarring up one side of his face and losing an eyeball (not to mention his sanity). Now employed by the \"world-famous\" Movieland Wax Museum in Buena Park, California, Vincent uses a special serum (described as a mixture of truth serum, nerve medicine and special \"vitamins and minerals\"... Watch out Centrum!) to paralyze victims. They disappear and the dense detectives on the case (headed by Scott Brady) act baffled as new \\'statues\\' are put on display in the museum. Vince talks to himself (\"I\\'m a terribly nice man!\"), chain-smokes, mumbles, hisses and describes how he gets \"excited\" by the sound of a woman\\'s scream.<br /><br />He also has to deal with a bunch of back-stabbing scumbags and self-absorbed witches, most of whom will deserve what\\'s coming to them. There is also Nick (Hollis Morrison), a boozy, inept museum tour guide who sees a \\'statue\\' blink, but doesn\\'t go to the cops. Aside from Max (a real Grade-A jerk... who doesn\\'t even die!) and the stupid cops, the other two lead roles are women and both are pretty atrocious. Marie Morgan (Anne Helm) is not your typical innocent heroine; this tramp has been engaged to no less that five different characters in this movie (!), including Vince, Max and two of the wax dummies/missing male stars (I guess she never had time to make a go at the one missing girl). For some reason, she also begs and pleads in her irritating baby-voice for Vince to give her a \\'replica\\' of the head he\\'s designing of the newest missing actor (and fiancé Number 5) Tony Deen (Phillip Baird). She doesn\\'t know that Vince has already jabbed a syringe in the back of his neck, but I love it when Mitchell dryly agrees with her demands \"so you can completely retreat for reality.\" He also wants her to \\'pose\\' for him, which means she\\'s eventually held prisoner in a box. Unfortunately, the box has a hole where her head sticks through so we have to continue getting aurally assaulted by her high-pitched whines.<br /><br />The other \"woman\" is Theresa (Victoria Carroll), one of the aforementioned go-go girls. She\\'s first seen proving she is thoroughly rhythm-deficient by jiggling on stage in a lime-green fringe bikini. Theresa is tolerable before she talks, but when you realize her grating presence combines the abrasiveness of Lorraine Bracco with the airhead mentality of the Landers sisters, you wish Vincent would inject her with the serum as soon as possible. Unfortunately, we\\'re first subjected to a scene of her making endless demands to the studio head honcho and running around in the museum trying to avoid Mitchell. She and the rest of the characters are completely unsympathetic, but function as a way to poke fun at the Hollywood system in general, I guess. And I\\'m probably giving this movie more credit than it actually deserves. The pluses are few and far between, but include (other than Mitchell and the dance routine), colorful, slightly stylized lighting and a bizarre ending that seems to suggest that Rinard will be severely punished for his crimes by spending the rest of his life in his own personal hell... Married to Marie!... Yikes, now that is scary.<br /><br />Also in the cast are director John \"Bud\" Cardos (also the production manager) as a police sergeant, James Forrest as a film director, Virgil Frye as a statue, Rini Martin and Kent Osborne as a bartender.

Rock Hudson was near the top of his 1950's stardom. Dorothy Malone is in excellent form, and wins an Oscar for support. Robert Stack is nominated & falls just short for his role.<br /><br />The story is a little soapy from another time but just as worthwhile as most dramas. Amazing how well drunks can drive in this film & also how quickly Stack sobers up in a couple of the films early sequences.<br /><br />You can see why the cast is so good & actually production wise this film is very good. You can tell Bacall is distracted during this film as while her acting is fine, she looks emotionally drained in some sequences.<br /><br />The sexual references in this film are so mild, that many of today's young viewers would not realize what they are.

There have been many \"horror movies\" that have been as low budget and bad as this one, like Jack Frost for instance, but something about this one was just not as funny.

While Cynthia Gibb portrays a realistic Karen, it is sad that so much has been edited...Louise Fletcher portrays her mother, and does an excellent job, with limited material and dialogue. In this case, I give the actors credit for surviving this project.<br /><br />Why is the audience not permitted to see causation factors?....American audiences are quite savvy, and if they have cable, usually educated.<br /><br />I sincerely feel that I could have written a better story, would not have edited out the truth, and allowed the actors to project the reality.<br /><br />Richard Carpenter, as director, has seriously underestimated and insulted American audiences.

Personally, I didn\\'t like it at all. Its an incoherent attempt at a atmospheric period cross between sex and violence. Jess Franco at his best makes these kinds of films very well. Unfortunately, the infamous exploitation filmmaker Joe D\\'Amato does not. D\\'Amato\\'s most well known films are infamous for their high gross-out quotient. This, an early film by him, doesn\\'t have the constant disgusting scenes that his more notorious \"Anthropophagous\" and \"Beyond the Darkness\" did. Ultimately, its an incoherent film that doesn\\'t manage to involve the viewer in any way. Without the sleaze factor either, it becomes very boring. As I said, others have enjoyed this film, but I just found it to be a perfect example of incredibly lazy writing.<br /><br />There are a few pluses for the film. Ewa Aulin (from \"Candy\") is in it, and she looks pretty hot and is often naked. However, cult film icon Klaus Kinski is completely wasted in a subplot with no connection to the main film. He seems bored with the role and doesn\\'t have the manic intensity he does at his finest. The music score is nice and there are some brief moments of unintentionally funny gore. Still, this is a pretentious and pointless film that manages to be incredibly boring.

I\\'m 22 now and I still love the film that much, I\\'m actually watching it right now.<br /><br />This review may contain spoilers! The Land Of Faraway or Mio Min Mio, as most people know it, is the story of a boy named Bosse. His adoptive parents hate him and let him know it, the older kids bully him, and he only has two real friends: Mrs. Lundin a nice young woman who works at a local store and Benke a boy from school. Bosse greatest dream is to have a father that loves him like Benke. One day Mrs. Lundin gives Bosse a golden apple and asks him to mail a post card for her. The post card is to the King of the Land of Faraway and says something like \"the one you have been looking for is here; he will have an apple of gold in his hand\". Then out of a bottle on the ground a giant head/spirit emerges and takes Bosse away to the Land of Faraway. Bosse finds out that he\\'s really Mio the Prince of the Land of Faraway! But there is a great evil man named Kato who steals children and turns them into birds, legend says that only a Prince can kill Kato and save the children. So Mio/Bosse sets of with friend Jum-Jum/Benke on an awesome adventure to defeat Kato! <br /><br />The music in the film is so beautiful and haunting; you will be humming it for days. The acting by Nick Pickard as Bosse/Mio and Christian Bale as Benke/Jum-Jum is outstanding. I particularly love the lighting in the film; firelight creates creepy shadows across the sets and really sets the mood for the darker scenes. The copy I have is old so the sound is really bad and since the movie was made in the late 1980s the video quality looks sort of fuzzy and out of focus compared to new DVDs.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to every kid I have ever met and to adults who are fantasy fans.<br /><br />~*Leah',\n"," 'Too bad it\\'s not available on VHS or DVD, when I first saw this film years ago I was blown away , the mood it evokes is totally what living life day to day is all about , pure existentialism, my father was one and I have some of that in me , so I totally got it , Life is but a fleeting moment by moment .Existentialist ,Camus was one along with Sartre it\\'s the same day everyday ,only we ,measure our own decay with the man made notion of time.Based on Camus\\'s novel This film will either impress you or bore you.But then again it all depends on how you look at life.

In my opinion, John Goodman should\\'ve been picked for this particular role because he definitely had Gleason\\'s build and look. Don\\'t get me wrong--Garrett did a good job, but Goodman would\\'ve carried that role VERY far.<br /><br />This movie covered Gleason\\'s childhood years in a broken home, his stand-up comedy career, his marriage and his various infidelities, as well as his early days in television up until the time of \"The Honeymooners\"; but what the film didn\\'t cover (but should have) was his later life beyond \"The Honeymooners\" and his major Hollywood works, from the tearjerker \"Gigot\" (one of my all-time favorite films) to the hilarious \"Smokey and the Bandit\" movies.<br /><br />This film would have merited a rating a ten from me, but I gave it a seven because of the casting choice of Brad Garrett and the film\\'s failure to show us the complete career of Jackie Gleason, who will always be The Great One in the hearts of his many fans.',\n"," \"I'm guessing that the folks talking up this drivel are cronies of the director or something.

There\\'s a trap in this kind of pictures: you have to differentiate between the movie itself and the moral concepts. If you don\\'t like \"Schindler\\'s List\" that does not mean that you agree with Hitler\\'s philosophy (or do you?). So, for me, it is a good film and an extraordinary story (since it is a real story that makes it much more extraordinary). Grandiloquent, self-kind, and everything but neutral (no matter what Amenábar or Bardem have said about it: those characters that are not in favor of euthanasia come to no good at all!!). 50 % Hard / 50% way too sentimental.<br /><br />-Epilogue: \"Mar Adentro\" wouldn\\'t be by no mean in my ranking of the best 50\\'s Spanish movies of all time. Nobody has special merits in the story but Ramon Sampedro himself. He IS the movie. Now, Alejandro Amenábar is gonna become the more international Spanish director ever, maybe he\\'ll go to live to Hollywood; but some of us would like to watch him filming a simple story, without bit final twists, without living dead nor dying alive... \"The Others\" is still his best movie.<br /><br />*My rate: 7/10',\n"," 'The story of \"Hellraiser:Hellworld\" revolves around a group of teens who receive invitations through a Hellraiser website to attend a Hellworld party.They then find themselves in a huge mansion party with plenty of sex and booze.The party is hosted by the Lance Henriksen character.Then one by one the gang start to die at the hands of Pinhead and the Cenobites at the urging of the host,who apparently has a hidden score to settle with each of the teens.\"Hellraiser:Hellworld\" is a crappy teen slasher flick with little bit of gore and sex thrown in.The characters are obnoxious and stupid and the action moves at snail\\'s pace.Pinhead is used sparingly and his dialogue sucks.The direction by Rick Bota is uninspired and the script by Joel Soisson is extremely predictable.Like \"Hellraiser:Deader\",\"Hellword\" is beyond bad and even Henriksen\\'s great performance can\\'t save the film.3 out of 10.',\n"," \":Trust Me, Its Paradise<br /><br />'The Beach' is a kinda of movie the feel of which surrounds you slowly and completely.<br /><br />I'd say Danny Boyle has done complete justification to the book. The movie captures the essence of the book. I watched the movie first and then read the book. The beach can be better experienced thru the movie. The music (by Angelo Badalamenti) is excellent, but unfortunately not popular( which is why I believe popular is not always the best ;-)). DiCaprio proves how versatile and powerful he is as an actor. A must watch for DiCaprio fans. Purchase an original DVD and you'll get to see alternate beginning and alternate climax of the movie with director's comments. You will like this movie especially if you are a crazy traveler and like to explore unseen and untouched places.<br /><br />Direction, location, music and DiCaprio are the strengths of the movie. 'The Beach' is not just a movie, its an experience.<br /><br />:never refuse an invitation, never resist the unfamiliar. Just keep your mind open and suck in the experience........\",\n"," \"I am not going to lie. Despite looking interesting, I watched The Notorious Bettie Page because I had heard (and it was fairly obvious just by looking at a synopsis or anything about the film), that Gretchen Mol got naked in it. I have never been a fan of Mol, but I cannot resist seeing an attractive woman taking off her clothes. Yes, that may be perverted, but its a theme and ideal central to the very core of the movie, and helps to make the film a lot stronger than it probably should be.<br /><br />The film chronicles Bettie Page's (Mol) life from her physical and sexually abused days as a kid in high school in the South, and onto her new life in New York. She wants to be an actress, but she has to pay bills too. After taking a few seemingly innocent shots on a local beach, Page slowly becomes a modeling sensation, and quickly jumps from suggestive photos to sexually provocative pin-up photographs.<br /><br />I feel the briefness of the film (just over ninety minutes) is both a curse and blessing for it. On one hand, the film never overstays its welcome. You get to know Page within a few short minutes, and then it gets right into her modeling career and does not look back. But it curses the film as well, because we never really get a chance to grasp everything that is going on. She just kind of jumps around between modeling shoots and the controversies that they create before jumping right into the major senate investigation that takes up much of the final act of the film. You just sit there, and attempt to absorb it all, and more just comes right at you. It feels like the filmmakers wanted to summarize too much material in too short a film. It begs for longer sequences, and begs more for even longer explanations. It does not feel rushed; it just does not feel all there.<br /><br />Another bit of a fumble, although a bit more of a curiosity, is the use of colour throughout the film. The majority is in black and white, but frequently, splashes and sequences of colour do emerge. But while this may have been done as a symbolic gesture early on, it becomes a bit of a distraction as it continually pops up later on before cutting back to black and white. It gets confusing, and becomes more of a tedious interference than anything else as the film goes on.<br /><br />While it may fumble a bit with the actions, the film stays dead-on with its themes. Page, who I know little to nothing about, is played off innocently, and her world is exactly the same. Save for a few shady characters during her teenage years, everyone she encounters is an innocent, and everything she does has an innocence to it. I never thought I would look at full frontal nudity as being something that was anything other than vulgar and depraved, but here, it truly is something to marvel at. All at once, it is beautiful and innocent. Even the most sexually perverted moments in the film (albeit tame compared to today's standards) have an innocent and angelic feeling to them. There is just something about the way Mol's nude body is portrayed that it just strikes at such a different chord than nude bodies in other films. It just feels so natural and so wondrous, that if there were any reason to watch the film, it would be to see the spectacular depictions of Mol's body as she plays Bettie Page.<br /><br />The other reason is Mol herself. As Page, she exemplifies that 1950's Southern belle everyone knows (or can at least imagine). Despite her profession, she is still a normal person, and still looks at herself as being religious. Mol plays her exactly to the right amount of squeaky-cleanliness needed to make this character feel authentically from the 1950's. She plays her with such matter-of-factness that you would be hard-set not to think that Mol was actually Bettie Page herself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the supporting cast have very little moments to shine, and are totally overshadowed by Mol's wonderful performance. None of them do anything particularly pleasing, and none of them really have that same strength in their role as Mol does. This is not really the fault of the actors, but more of the fact that they do not have much to work with. Many of them are totally recognizable, such as Oscar-nominee David Strathairn (in a role a little too close to one of his better performances), Sarah Paulson (recent Golden Globe nominee for Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip), and character actor Lili Taylor, but you would be hard set to really place their performance in being anything other than okay. None of these characters are really developed, and they really just stand as character cut-outs who Mol runs loops around as she picks up steam in her brilliant performance.<br /><br />Really, this film is worthwhile for its portrayal of nudity, and for Gretchen Mol's excellent performance of Bettie Page. Everything else is a bit too muddled and awkward than it should be. Had more work been done to develop supporting characters and not just blast right through the story, this film would have been a much better biographical film. As it stands, it is just a vehicle for Mol to really rise into the stratosphere of popularity as an actress.<br /><br />7/10.\",\n"," 'The movie was not a waste except for some boring scenes in between.But the women cast gave a pretty good show than the males who were laughable. <br /><br />But Krista Allen really rocked in the movie .Her voice was so seducing and sexy.The scenes in the bed involving Krista should have shortened but she made it so watchable and sexier than any one could do.Krista really is one of the best in such roles.She also enacted quiet well as the baddie in the last 5 minutes,which is the interesting part of the movie.<br /><br />Burt Reynolds was not that good and this was not his best as an action star.He could have chosen a better script than this.Ireally think he did for money.',\n"," \"On a routine mission in Iraq a group of Delta soldiers recover a computer hard drive from an Alqueda training camp detailing the location of weapons specialist Dr Walsh.

I found this movie to be much better than what I was expecting.There is lots of action and lots of blood. Its more or less what you would expect from a creature feature. The acting isn't great but its passable. I have certainly seen worse.Overall its an enjoyable movie for what it is.

Well, this movie has like 50. You know it was a conspiracy at the academy awards.

Bonanza is still infinitely re watchable in re runs.<br /><br />The series chronicles the adventures of the Cartwright family, who live on a ranch near Virginia City, Nevada around the Civil War era. Their ranch (called the Ponderosa) is run and defended by the widowed father, Ben, and his unmarried three sons, Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe. These three brothers have different mothers, all of whom have passed away years earlier.<br /><br />The Cartwrights are a hard working, prosperous, and honourable family, highly respected in those parts. The Ponderosa is large so reaching its extremities requires a lot of horseback riding. Also, trips away are often necessary in order to buy or sell cattle and so forth. Needless to say, few of these excursions pass uneventfully. Although hospitable, much of the Cartwrights' energy must be spent defending their ranch from interlopers, or protecting themselves from townsfolk jealous of their prosperity and stellar reputation. The Cartwrights do a fair bit of firing their guns up in the air and such, but only shoot to kill when deemed absolutely necessary. They are involved in various town affairs, even the political life of the Nevada territory.<br /><br />One of the main assets of the series is the underlying warmth that is always present (despite occasional disagreements) between Ben and his three sons, and (despite frequent disagreements) between the three brothers. Now, one brother might beat up another every now and then, but generally has a good reason for it at the time and his anger never lasts long! The characters are all very well drawn. Ben is portrayed as a successful and noble man of great integrity. The oldest son, Adam, the most rational and suave of the brothers, left midway through the series. The middle brother, Hoss, is a gentle giant of a teddy bear, who has an insatiable appetite for food and is a little shy around the ladies. The youngest, Little Joe, is a hot headed, handsome charmer who, by contrast, has quite a way with women. This trio of brothers enjoy various romances but their love interests are typically killed off by the end of the episode or else marriage proves impossible, for whatever reason.<br /><br />The actors are all stellar in their roles, including Pernell Roberts (Adam), Dan Blocker (Hoss), Michael Landon (Little Joe), and of course Lorne Greene as the principled family patriarch, Ben. I also love the ranch cook, Hop Sing, played by Victor Sen Yung.<br /><br />This is a wonderful action packed western with great values. The Cartwrights are always the noble heroes and most of the bad guys quite villainous.

The mysterious owner, \\'Blackie\\' (Robert Englund) gives them a second chance to correct all the blunders they have made in life and as a result of their success, lets them stay on as the new cook and waitress at the café.<br /><br />The café serves as both a central location for the action and as a plot catalyst, primarily by exerting its influence upon each episode\\'s protagonists, or antagonists, to bring them into contact with the regulars. Aside from transporting itself from place to place in its entirety, once settled, it can also create portals between itself and various locations, which are traversed (often unexpectedly on the whim of the café) by crossing the threshold of one of the café\\'s many doorways. These portals are not restricted to the Earth, the café can also travel to outer space and, apparently, even heaven, which hints at a supernatural origin.<br /><br />The café also has the ability to make both idle and heartfelt wishes come true, which of course are not always what the recipient actually wants or needs, and the café seems to take a perverse delight in \"misinterpreting\" such wishes. Frank and Fay often take advantage of this ability by wishing themselves from place to place, when this occurs, or when the café otherwise deems it important, those remaining in the dining room can watch the exploits of their companions on the (sometimes interactive) television set mounted in the far wall.<br /><br />Of the cast, Robert Englund (better known to the public as \\'Freddy Kruger\\') was the stand out. Blackie was a creepy, sarcastic know-it-all but Englund\\'s portrayal of him gave you no reason to dislike him. Jack Coleman was terrific as Frank, looking past his facetious manner you can see deep down he is a warm hearted guy. Lindsay Frost\\'s insecure Fay made a big impression on yours truly, mainly because of the waitress\\' outfit.<br /><br />As I said, with the show\\'s cast and excellent scripts by Wes Craven and Thomas Baum etc, its a travesty that \\'Nightmare Cafe\\' only lasted for six episodes. Was it too clever for some viewers? Who knows? I enjoyed it thoroughly, and so will you if you manage to see it.',\n"," \"Firstly, Rear Window by Alfred Hitchcock is one of my favorite movies, however it is important not to compare this to that classic. Remakes are often less impressive than the originals because you know what's coming and because older films relied much more on acting as opposed to present day films which tend to rely on special effects, violence and sex.<br /><br />That aside, this film was overall a fairly enjoyable film to watch. My one major complaint for this one is that it wrapped up too quickly. By the time we have this guy getting accused of killing people, he's shoving the mother's head into the door and coming to the main character's house and slamming people's heads in with a bat.<br /><br />I think the film could really have been improved by letting the suspicions and tensions run a little longer. It seemed like we found out that he really was the killer too soon.<br /><br />Otherwise, I thought this was a fun film to watch mixed with some funny moments. It's worth watching.\",\n"," \"It's amazing to me what some people will say about movies and most of it doesn't make sense.

After the jumbo jet takes off Captain Larkin gets a radio call from security in New York City. First, a box was found in the first class section that security thought it was a bomb that turned out to be a smoking jack in the box. Next security finds a note in the lounge with an ominous message left by a passenger threatening to kill some of the passengers. At first, it is thought to be a sick joke, but soon a man posing as a priest and a flight attendant are killed. It is up to the captain to find the killer before the body count increases. All and all the weasel gives this movie 8 star. As far as Farrah Fawcett Majors goes, she did a great job at being the flight attendant in charge.\",\n"," 'This Night Listener is better than people are generally saying. It has weaknesses, and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis, no doubt, but I think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this. The whole thing feels like one of those fireside \"this happened to a friend of a friend of mine\" ghost stories. One big complaint about the movie is the pacing: but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate. Everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility, and real life just sort of plods along\\x97no?

Liza Minelli as the brassy Sally Boules outshines everyone in her splendid \"Come to the Cabaret\" presentation.<br /><br />It is amazing how much action can take place on the confines of the tiny cabaret stage and how soon one is completely absorbed in the solo acts. The cabaret audience and its reaction are left out of the picture most of the time, the camera concentrating on the singing and dancing. The choreography and costumes are top class and the acts soon become the most interesting part of the production.<br /><br />Against a background of Nazi propaganda there are the continual rumblings of anti-Jewish sentiments in 1931 Berlin and a nervous anticipation of events likely to follow. But the MC invites his audience to leave all their problems, their worries, their cares outside and enjoy the cabaret where everything, just everything, is \"beautiful\".<br /><br />Intertwined with the stage presentations at the cabaret are the off-stage relationships between Sally and her lovers. Understandably these scenes do not quite sparkle like the rest of the film. I do however enjoy the scene where Brian Roberts (Michael York) and Sally get a little tipsy, clink glasses and make a toast \"Here\\'s to you and the baby\".<br /><br />Liza Minelli has beautiful eyes which she uses to great advantage.

As hinted at before already, the first half of \"The Dark Power\" is terribly lame and sleep-inducing. The clichéd pranks, the retarded dialogs and the ridiculously overlong footage of Lash LaRue swinging around his whip seem to go on forever.

As it turns out, it was a montage of all their own marital problems. So the film was, in essence cathartic dumping ground for the writers and director.<br /><br />As filmmaking, it was terrific. Rob Reiner weaves the story together expertly, creating a stark contrast between the joy of the romance and the reality of the relationship. The film was punctuated by numerous funny and sweet moments that make the viewer smile and glow with delight.<br /><br />Michelle Pfeiffer gives a splendid performance of a very emotionally complex and neurotic character. It took a lot of courage for her to take this part because she was playing the least likeable character in the film, something of a departure for her. Bruce Willis was as good as one could have expected considering the fact that nobody was blowing anything up. Actually, he was quite good as the impulsive, childlike romantic, but when it came to the arguments and the serious displays of resentment, he played the scenes too harshly, almost commando style.<br /><br />Reiner does good camera work and puts together some good rapid fire scenes that have impact and give great insight into the relationship. He also took the film on location in Venice to add a little romantic interlude, and somehow got Eric Clapton to write a great theme song.<br /><br />The problem is the story. Reiner stated in the featurette that he intended this to be a realistic bittersweet look at the real problems relationships face. But he tried to do too much and made this film a grossly exaggerated caricature of a relationship in crisis. It is really \"The War of The Roses\" lite only it takes itself too seriously. No one I know who saw this could believe that this couple could possibly have stayed married for 15 weeks, no less 15 years. <br /><br />The result is a noxious marathon of petty arguments that get under the viewers\\' skin after a while. It is about as entertaining as watching your best friends have a niggling argument in a public restaurant. The whole thing leaves you very uncomfortable and you don\\'t go home feeling like you\\'ve had a nice evening.<br /><br />So, while it succeeds as filmmaking, it fails as a film. I gave this film a 6/10. There were so many good elements to it that I can\\'t see trashing it. But the story is one that requires a level of emotional endurance that few viewers will be willing or able to invest to get any enjoyment out of it.<br /><br />',\n"," 'The city couple Andy and Elisabeth Farmer, played by Chevy Chase and Madolyn Smith, leave the city life to move out to the country. He is going to write a novel, but things doesn´t go exactly as planned. Lots of disasters make their new life go awry and it seems country life wasn´t as simple as they thought. <br /><br />In Funny Farm, all the magic that made the first Vacation-movie so great is missing. Even the silly sequel, National Lampoon´s European Vacation, seems rather fun in comparison. The jokes are predictable and rarely hit the spot. It´s difficult for Chase to do anything with this material, his acting skills definitely deserves better scripts. Madolyn Smith is not bad as his wife, and it´s rather surprising that she hasn´t done any acting since 1994.<br /><br />With a pretty promising plot, the movie could have been a funny trip to the countryside, but Chevy Chase has done much better movies.<br /><br />Sarah Michelle Gellar is seen in a blink-and-you-miss-her appearance, and this might be fun to check out for Buffy-fans. But this itself is not a reason to sit through this movie, it´s simply to dull.<br /><br />* ½ out of * * * * *',\n"," \"I can remember seeing this movie as a kid in 1977 or 1978. HBO would show it late at night back when they were they one and only movie pay channel in existence. Back then it was UNRATED and was the only movie of its kind ever shown on pay television...especially back then. I would love to see it now as an adult where I would be more apt to understand the adult theme of it. It was probably the closest thing I had ever seen to pornography at the young age of 7 or 8. Luckily I had stupid babysitters and party-going parents on the weekends. Most of my memory of this movie was the completely erratic sexual behavior of these two guys. Breaking into houses to sniff underwear, feeding on a stranger's breast milk on a public bus, and fornicating in a cab at the request of one of their female subjects were just a few of the whacked escapades these guys were pulling off. A very racy film for the early '70s. Until I checked IMDb, I had no idea this movie had such a following. Most people I talk to have never heard of it.\",\n"," \"As an adult viewer, I had to think back and view the movie through the eyes of a teenager in order to appreciate it. And in doing so, I thoroughly enjoyed watching Camp. Some of the dialogue is awkward, and the story lines don't always wrap up quite neatly, or at least not ideally. But that's how life is, especially during the often awkward adolescent years, and the emotional realism is touching.<br /><br />Though it loses momentum at times, the movie never loses my interest because of it's strong characters, great musical numbers, and its fanciful--though a bit unrealistic--depiction of this teen-drama-summer camp world that I barely knew existed. And it's a particular world that most people have never experienced, but anybody who's ever felt awkward as a teenager can relate to this movie. Though never an aspiring actor or singer, I certainly related, and I enjoyed every minute of it.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure if Camp fits neatly into the musical genre, and I don't care. I do know that I couldn't even watch the first 10 minutes of the new Hairspray musical with John Travolta. It repulsed me. But I love Camp, (as I do Dancer in the Dark) which in my non-musical-expert opinion, has too much music-less dialogue, thankfully, to be considered a true musical. This favorable review of Camp is from someone who generally hates musicals.\",\n"," \"I think the opening 20 minutes of this film is perhaps one of the most exciting filmed, with the brilliant music score working to build tension to a shattering climax. What cinema goers made of this in the 30s, I can only imagine. The 'Times' said at the time, 'A miracle has come to the screen.' Watch it and marvel.\",\n"," 'This film ran on the Sundance Channel last night, and after watching less than ten minutes of it, i knew I was in the presence of yet another poorly written, embarrassingly acted piece of TLA crap. This film had me groaning out loud at how poorly written the dialog is.

But I warn you, if the sound is on, you\\'re going to be screaming at the screen.<br /><br />Don\\'t waste 90 minutes of your life on this mess.

The cast was fantastic..I don't understand how this movie gets a 2 out of 5 rating. I loved it.. I have seen other movies of his and they were also funny but this one really stick out in my mind because of the humor.. His I just can't say enough about this movie. I look for it to be on periodically but it never on enough for me. The people playing the homeless people were by comparison up to the funniest standards also. Please put this movie on more often. I can't see it enough..Leslie Ann Warren also was another favorite of mine, ever since Cinderella. I always thought that she wasn't really funny but loved her acting. In this movie she was very funny..and her and Mel did a great job together.

Don't waste your time or money on this!\",\n"," \"Superbly developed characters into the lots of funny situations full of spirit, absurdness and Serbian mentality. Movie is a great comedy, enjoyable, interesting, unpredictable. Best point in a film: characters, then humor itself, story and dialogs. Humor has 'inner development' , rare in Serbian movies. So, it is consequence of characterization, is well motivated, spontaneous and cogent. Also it is sharp, intelligent and lucid. Most of the movies, unfortunately, had constructed humor (devise a joke and put it into a characters's mouth) or ordinary situation comedy, burlesque, farce. Some of the 'art immortality' are incorporated in this movie. Little masterpiece, hardly reachable.\",\n"," \"This is not so much a Western as a film noir that happens to be set in New Mexico around the turn of the century. Dame Judith Anderson steals the film as both the catalyst of all that happens and, in many ways, its hero. Dean Jagger is marvelous as the villainous lawman who cannot leave well enough alone. Harry Carey Jr. scores with a memorable portrayal of a well-meaning milquetoast manipulated by Jagger. <br /><br />The photography and editing (James Wong Howe and Christian Nyby) are topnotch film noir. Alan Hale (Sr.) is perfect as the wry gambler who recognizes Mitchum's talent and woos him as a partner. Mitchum does a fine job as the emotionally paralyzed Jeb who is basically decent but with a busted emotional compass, he allows himself to be led by the fates. Although I'm not normally a fan of the sleepy-eyed and laconic Mitchum, I thought his signature traits were used to excellent effect here, and well explained by the trauma that eats him apart so much inside that he is unwilling to stand up for himself. Teresa Wright is stunning as Mitchum's foster-sister-turned-object-of-lust-turned-true-love-tuned-would-be-executioner-turned-true love again. What a woman!<br /><br />One thing that differentiates this 1947 film in my book as a noir not a western is that the two main women are anything but passive -- and even more so -- ANYTHING BUT madonnas or whores. They are unafraid to fire guns or stand up to militias. But they will fulfill what is in their hearts even when it means societal disapproval or death. <br /><br />Although the plot is full of holes, the storytelling is excellent enough to overcome it. Great pacing too -- a really fun ride.\",\n"," \"I just got back from the GLBT Film Festival at the AMC Loews 34th in NY. A friend told me about this film. Audience response was very positive! Lots of good solid laughs as well as some quiet moments of realization. Top notch in every area. A movie that makes you think, and then makes you realize how lucky we'd all be if we could turn back time and live without shame or guilt. I imagine this will come close to, if not win, the audience favorite award! What was most surprising was the fact the the movie appears to start off as a satire and then slowly weaves into a genuine commentary on the negative and sometimes violent reactions of the very group it started to satirize. There isn't any mean spirited humor at the expense of one group, just a slow realization that we would all be better off if we just went back to the gentle innocence that we all started off with.\",\n"," 'Though not completely awful, this film disappoints. Though independent directors bemoan the studio system and how it stifles creativity, there is at least one thing that the studios have done fairly consistently: they\\'ve been able to remind directors that good acting is highly desirable. Too many indie directors take a concept and some creative ideas and then simply relegate the acting to the lowest priority possible. That\\'s one of the problems with \"Splinter\"...budget-level acting. I don\\'t consider Sizemore to be an outstanding actor, but he truly embarrasses virtually every other actor in this film, especially Atis, who simply appears amateurish and uncertain in every scene.<br /><br />So, sorry...can\\'t recommend this one at all. Crummy acting condemns a movie, regardless of the concept, story, and other production values.',\n"," 'This film is shockingly underrated on IMDb. Like so many films, this isn\\'t Shawshank. But it\\'s a reasonably good, if predictable, dance competition / personal growth film. If you want to spend an hour and a half watching a sort of 8 Mile for a female step dancer, than I think you\\'ll like it.<br /><br />Judging from the IMDb ratings, my guess is that this movie was approaching the top 250, and was \"vote bombed\" with many 1s, as happens to so many films that aren\\'t about the mob, don\\'t have special effects, or include non-white or non-straight characters.<br /><br />It\\'s an American film, but it\\'s not a US film. Set mostly in Toronto the cues are subtle, and some audiences may think it\\'s set entirely in the US just because the final competition is in the border city of Detroit.<br /><br />I liked the music. I liked the dance (but not convinced it\\'s worth $50,000 ... but what do I know). The characters were easy on the eyes.<br /><br />I do agree the title sucks. I don\\'t remember anyone in the film saying those words, and it should have an \"s\". (No, it\\'s not a foreign language).<br /><br />There\\'s not a lot to hate about this film (and let\\'s be honest, a vote of 1 means you hated it) so I can only assume that it\\'s an expression of hate for the kind of people in it, and that\\'s sad.',\n"," '........and an extremely bad one at that!!! How long did this train-wreck last?? 14 episodes or something?? I can see why now.<br /><br />I bought the \"Serenity\" episode from Amazon Unboxed. It was my first purchase, so was free. That is the ONLY good thing about the experience (incident??)<br /><br />I won\\'t comment really on the acting, since these were, I guess, fairly new people who hadn\\'t really gotten the job down just right yet. At least I\\'ve never seen them before in any type of major show, theater or TV. If I did, then I have easily forgotten them.<br /><br />But the special effects were absolutely horrendous. True, this isn\\'t exactly a multi-million $$ project, but the original Star Trek did better than this & that was THIRTY-FIVE YEARS ago. I especially got a laugh out of the bad guys (reapers or something like that) ship as it chased the hilarious looking Firefly, with smoke coming out of the engines looking something like a gigantic model rocket. I fully expected to eventually see the Wiley Coyote riding on top, while chasing after the Roadrunner. MODERN jet/rocket engines don\\'t even do it that bad.<br /><br />And that wasn\\'t even the worst of it. The wild-west type shoot-outs had me wondering if I was actually watching a sci-fi film or a Gene Autry one.<br /><br />Regardless of the hype, don\\'t waste your time...I did...all 80-something minutes of the disaster called \"Firefly\".',\n"," 'The computer animated skull was the cheesiest, dumbest, most retarded thing I have seen in a long time. I couldn\\'t even hear what it was saying. I just assumed that it was the normal crypt-keeper rip-off crap. Not that the Crypt Keeper was good. <br /><br />Then we are introduced to the story of two guys with a broken down car who meet a random girl, and then, respectively, a Southern Deputy. That is the overarching plot, but it doesn\\'t matter. It takes up less time then the sub-stories. I also was unable to hear what the zany deputy was saying throughout his five hour long idiotic rambling.<br /><br />The first sub story was just unimaginative. We listen to repetitive punk rock for ten minutes before the story actually begins. A guy kills people at a mental institution that performs hideous experiments on it\\'s charges. Then the story REALLY takes off with a bunch of jock teen kids molesting a gardener. BUT WAS HE FROM THE MENTAL INSTITUTION??? WE DON\\'T KNOW!!!! Well, they know that he\\'s unstable, saying that he killed his family, and then unburied them and \"killed them again.\" Oh, what a card that psychopathic gardener is! Then they are hanging out in a large inexplicable vacant lot with various sport equipment. The gardener then kills all the kids who are too ****ing dumb to use the golf clubs they have to bludgeon the killer from a distance OR to stick together so he couldn\\'t possibly stand a chance since he, like this movie, sucks really bad. Oh, and he stuffs all his victims.<br /><br />It warrants special attention that in this particular story, the lead teen jerk has a fake ear for half the sub-story. Not a good fake ear, one that doesn\\'t have an ear hole. It looks like it\\'s falling off every time he falls down. I mean, nothing actually happens to his ear after it is originally attacked, and it isn\\'t even a fake bloody ear. Just a regular flesh colored, hole-less ear. I hate this movie for that. <br /><br />Next is the story of some kids who steal a Native American\\'s pot, have a bad trip and become old. I need say no more, as my IQ score drops in a negative exponential curve each second I think about this story.<br /><br />The last is a whole bunch-o-fun! This girl is making out in the car, okay? We\\'ll call her No Name, since I don\\'t know or care what her name is. Now get this, she is afraid of some guy stalking her! Got that, \\'cause that actually almost matters. Now her girlfriend starts talking about revenge on their boyfriends, because the boyfriends taped them having intercourse without their permission. MORE SUSPENSE!!!! And then a deputy who is southern (even though nobody else in the scene is) agrees to investigate the stalker for No Name. And then the stalker is forgotten in lieu of a fake teen sex scene. See, the girl\\'s plans are to get the guys drunk so they can films the guys doing stuff. Then they all get killed except No Name, WHO IS ALSO THE KILLER!!!!!! o_0 OMGWTFBBQ????!!!!1!!!! It also shows the fakest kill ever, as No Name kills her girlfriend by playfully tapping her in side of the head with a poker. Not with the sharp part, the dull part. Hitting her at .0000000000000000000000000000000001 attometers per mega second! Her girlfriend keels over like drunken decapitated moose who gave up on life. Did I mention how much I hate hate hate hate hate this movie?<br /><br />Oh, And in the over arching plot, the random girl they find is evil. We don\\'t know why, but she is.

Even his wife, was somewhat of a third leg for such a simple storyline.<br /><br />Spending so much money on making a comedy was a huge mistake. Although, Carell's career might profit from this movie, there's no real reason to go see it.<br /><br />If only there was a little less of his family, a little more of Carell, Molly Shannon and maybe some other SNL cast, it could have actually been a lot more entertaining.<br /><br />4/10 for a few chuckles here and there.\",\n"," \"I think the cards were stacked against Webmaster, because right from the start there was this itchy feeling, like something was wrong but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. Then it hit me. Dubbed. For a little while, they managed most of the lines either as voice over or off screen, with just a little hint here and there, until it became painfully obvious. This is the kind of dubbing that grates on the nerves, with nothing even remotely funny about it. I hate dubbing, but at least, however misplaced, martial arts films badly dubbed tend to have a sense of humour about it.<br /><br />What I wanted was a film about a hacker doing actual hacking and stuff like that. Maybe like a reverse side of the table of the movie Hackers (being about the person trying to keep them out instead about the people trying to get in). What I got was some poorly written, nonsensical at times murder mystery with a ton of bad chase sequences, a supposedly inept hacker who was neutered without his little ego, and a director who obviously didn't know how to handle a camera. I just wanted to reach in there, grab the camera from the guy, and shoot the dang thing myself. The editing wasn't much better. The acting? Well, I guess if the lead guy didn't have such a bad script to work from, he'd be at least watchable. The main bad guy was OK, too, but pretty much everyone else was a joke. Dubbing didn't help, but the acting was pretty bad even taking that into consideration.<br /><br />Before I get into more bad, let's perk up to a few good things. Well, one or two. Despite the rudimentary graphics, I rather enjoyed the cyberworld stuff, what little there was of it, and would have much rather watched a movie mostly about, in, and around that than the tepid surroundings outside in the 'real world'. The falsifying thumbprint thing seemed kind of cool, but ended up being rather useless in the scheme of things. The heart gadget, which reminded me of Guillermo Del Toro's Cronos, was interesting, though as a plot device ripped directly from the pages of Escape from New York, it was horribly conceived in the long run. There's one point where the bad guy is unconscious and our hero is right there. Why didn't he try the bad guy's thumb print then (since the heart device was thumb activated)? Nonetheless, some interesting gadgets and cyber stuff, if only they could have been utilized better.<br /><br />Now, who here dares compare this movie to Blade Runner? Both films take place sometime in the future and there's some kind of off kilter type of romance in it, sort of, in both films. There's the investigation of a murder, but I've seen many a film with a murder at its center that are nothing like either Blade Runner or Webmaster. Identity, for instance. That's about where the similarities end. Period. There is no comparison, just as there wouldn't be between Blade Runner and Hackers. Ridley Scott is a brilliant director with a great mind for art direction and knows some fundamentals of film-making, like where to put the camera. Webmaster is cheap, and not just because of the budget. It's cheap because of bad writing, and because it more often than not takes the easy way out (like writing in a character who barely appeared in the first place to save the girl in the end to get her to Point B by herself without the Hero, so that he could do his thing. Very convenient. Or, the attempted sympathy factor for a character we have no reason to care for. Or, inane things like the car set up to stall them just enough for someone to get away.).<br /><br />It tries to be hip, it tries to be exploitive, it even tries a twist ending that's not the least bit surprising, and it tries to be thrilling. But a bunch of near identical chase sequences, bad writing, editing, horribly shot, bad acting, etc. does not a thrilling movie make.\",\n"," 'I wonder what has gone into those peoples heads who think that this movie is bad.It was such a beautiful film.This film had everything what a good movie should have strong performances,beautiful sets,soothing music,excellent direction.

The script was horrible which made it even more difficult for the actors to make it seem real so it's not 100% their fault. The ending was completely predictable and obvious as opposed the the classic what the hell ending of the original that still makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand. The killings were basic repeats of the original primarily the first killing. The only reason I would give it a 1 is because of the murder scene in the woods (you know what I'm talking about) and the broom stick scene. The annoying fat guy was just horrible, I felt no sympathy for him whatsoever since he was a pain in the @$$ to others as well not mention the worst actor of them all.

It\\'s nowhere near a great film, but its importance lies in Otto Preminger\\'s dedication to making it feel real and on the edge of melodrama and naturalism. What I liked is that it\\'s not so much an expose of junkies (if you want the best expose of that read Naked Lunch, if you can get through it anyway, besides the point), but the nature of the urban environment Frankie Machine lives. He expects after he gets out of prison for dealing to go on the straight and narrow, to become a drummer in a band and make it legit as a musician. But he has his \"crippled\" wife Zosch, who can\\'t work and needs money and often complains, and then there\\'s the old neighborhood- he can\\'t escape seeing Louie (Darren McGavin), who is still doing back-room card games and, yes, pushing dope. Like Mean Streets, it\\'s hard to escape the minutia unless you leave.<br /><br />But then again, it\\'s hard for Frankie Machine not to try and operate naturally in this urban quarter. It\\'s just that he can\\'t escape the temptation of junk (when he\\'s booked on a phony theft charge with his friend, he sees a junkie freaking out, and it puts back the fear of going back on into his clean self). And personifying Frankie is Sinatra, and I can\\'t see anyone else who could\\'ve played him, even original choice Brando. He fits into the neighborhood, and seems like the kind of guy who should be a step ahead of the game. But there\\'s also a vulnerability to Sinatra that he pulls out wonderfully, and by the time we see him going \\'cold turkey\\' in Molly\\'s apartment, it\\'s believable even if it\\'s not the kind of thing those from \\'my\\' generation would think of heroin (i.e. Trainspotting and certainly Requiem for a Dream). If for nothing else, you want to watch the movie to see what happens to Sinatra as this character.<br /><br />The flaws, however, come in some of the other performances, though it\\'s a little tricky. Eleanor Parker seems to be overacting for a good portion of the movie, fooling Frankie that she\\'s really crippled when in reality she can walk and is fooling him for one reason or another. But then it becomes clearer as it goes along- she\\'s supposed to be nuts, and nuts with jealousy, and on that level it starts to get better. Meanwhile, Kim Novak is good, though not Vertigo-worthy, as the possible girl in the side but more like the voice of reason in the story. Then there\\'s a Detective Bendar, who might be one of the most one-note characters/performances, ever. And also Sparrow, Frankie\\'s nerdy friend, and the characters of Louie and Schiefka, and they\\'re all played as one might expect them to (actually, McGavin is better than OK). As far as casting other talent around Sinatra, Preminger doesn\\'t do all that great. And, frankly, some scenes kind of fall flat.<br /><br />But there\\'s a lot of fascination in the Man with the Golden Arm, and not just as some dated piece of sociological interest. It works as compelling drama, and as a message piece conveyed without being preachy or campy. It\\'s a genuine article, just not exceptional.',\n"," \"1st watched 10/10/2009 - 8 out of 10 (Dir - Billy Wilder): Spectacular rendering of Lindbergh's famous flight by James Stewart as Lindbergh and Director Billy Wilder. There isn't really a whole lot of background built into this story but that's OK because Wilder makes the event really remarkable as it comes directly from Lindbergh's perspective since he used his book as the basis of the movie. This early movie about flying has to be one of the best about the act itself as well. Stewart talking and thinking to himself during the flight gives you so much insight into what Lindbergh went thru in this 33 hour solo flight across the Atlantic. And he did the whole flight without sleeping the night before -- which is amazing!! There is a little backstory about how he purchased the plane and got the financing, and some flashbacks about his life during the flight but the movie is mostly about the flight. The story is also beautifully made and photographed and is a joy to watch despite it's age. I appreciate the fact that they didn't throw in a lot of fluff and just let the story tell itself. Well done throughout. This is a classic movie that should be viewed by all.\",\n"," \"If you liked Freaks and Geeks this is a must-see. Judd Apatow once again created a hysterical and touching series with characters that really become more like friends. The half hour format makes these a bit lighter than Freaks and Geeks - and when this show was canceled they weren't quite as able to still wrap things up as with the earlier show. But this certainly filled the void in my TV-viewing life left by the departure of Freaks and Geeks. Many of the members of the cast from that show appear here - some as regulars, others in hysterical guest performances. This is definitely one of those watch it in a single weekend marathon kind of shows.\",\n"," 'I can\\'t believe people like this show!!!! This worthless piece of crap should be off the air by now!!!

The director chooses an \"arty\" approach with lots of slow-motion sequences, \"poetic\" music and minimal dialogue, and it doesn\\'t work. The characters have no personality, the script is virtually non-existent and the suspense is deflated by the fact that the \"evil\" car\\'s driver (or the evil car itself) has plenty of opportunities to get away from the heroine who chases him, but keeps returning to do battle with her as if he has some scores to settle (we never find out what they might be).

Hallie Kate Eisenberg is just as adorable as always and does a wonderful job in her first movie part. I encourage anyone who has yet to see this movie to rent it or catch it on TV. It really captures the emotions of the characters and leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy.

Lathe of Heaven is one of my favorite books, and I had seen the 1980 version... but I thought that it would be possible to do a newer version that wouldn't look so dated and low budget. (though I did enjoy the 1980 version).<br /><br /> So I begin watching it and am immediately struck by substantial differences between the novel and this movie version. That's okay with me-- I am not one of those novel Nazis who say that you can't change a thing when translating a work from one medium to another.<br /><br /> They introduce a character, who is a friend of George's. He seems to serve as something of a springboard, so that we can see what George is thinking. No problem so far.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, it quickly becomes clear that the screenwriter did not understand the novel at all. Haber's intentions are good-- the world is horrible and he wants to use George to change it for the better. And, yes, he does change it a bit to improve his position in life.<br /><br /> The screenplay doesn't seem to correctly emphasize that Haber is purposefully having George dream certain dreams to change reality for the better. And that the changing of reality is not to be taken lightly-- there are unintended consequences, because everything is connected.<br /><br />So, basically, don't see it. Ever. I give it a rating of 2 only to congratulate the filmmakers for making a good choice of a novel to do-- just that they did it so poorly.<br /><br />\",\n"," 'Wow was this BAD!!! Bette Davis (in her last film role sad to say) is a witch who marries Lionel Stander (wisely walking through his role) and invades his house which he shares with his adult children (Colleen Camp and David Rasche).

With Davis gone this officially became unwatchable--I turned it off after an hour.<br /><br />Before this \"Burnt Offerings\" was Davis\\' worst film--this is 100 times worse! I admit she does have a fun opening line--\"Call me mom!\" but she looks terrible. Her speech is slurred because of one of the strokes she had and wears a terrible red wig. Davis was obviously very ill when she did this. Still, despite it all, she manages to make the most of her small screen time. All the dialogue is terrible with tons of unfunny comedy but Davis bravely makes the worst lines sound quite funny. And there is a somewhat funny visual joke revealing Camp\\'s former mother was Joan Crawford! It\\'s a shock seeing Davis looking this terrible and--basically--the film is just dreadful.

The show is hosted by Mark Kermode (also of \"On The Edge Of Blade Runner\" fame), who narrates the whole show, and is on hand to give little quips about the production of the films.<br /><br />The documentary primarily deals with the 1979 original masterpiece, and Ridley Scott, Dan O\\'Bannon, Sigourney Weaver and other participants are on hand to talk about their experiences making the film. Of course, where the real meat is (and is something that wasn\\'t included on the cut version of the doc on the Alien Quadrilogy DVD set) concerns the making of Aliens, Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection. Granted, all of the participants in the Aliens interviews have nothing but glowing praise for the film, but when you get down to the later entries, people have some surprisingly interesting things to say, including H.R. Giger, who compares the alien suit design in Alien 3 to a piece of excrement, and Lance Henriksen talking about how the third film destroyed all the work that was put into the first two entries, it sheds a whole new perspective on what it was like for the cast and crew to experience these films.<br /><br />It is understandable that Fox would want to cut these offending bits (seeing as how they cut an hour of candid footage of David Fincher out of the Alien 3 Special Edition documentaries), so they recut the film and had it focus on the first movie instead. I don\\'t believe this was a wise move, and I think that if the studio heads have a chance, they should release this documentary in it\\'s original form for everyone to see.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I am giving this a 9 out of 10, because, as it is, the documentaries featured on the Alien Quadrilogy set actually have better in-depth coverage of the same material posted here, but not everything. If you can find it, the documentary airs on television sometimes.

Here however he\\'s just plain irritating , unconvincing and I lost count at the number of times he mugged for the camera .

Debbie has just hit town, become a stewardess, slept with an elderly rich man(who she describes is in his 50\\'s but obviously hit that mark a decade or two ago), shoots nude scenes for a photographer she just met, and then is the central element to a kidnapping/extortion plot. Through it all and amidst all that emotional upheaval and soul-searching, what in heaven\\'s name will Debbie do? Well, I cannot give it away completely but don\\'t expect any real epiphany here. Let\\'s face it. Naughty Stewardesses is just what it wants to be(at least two-thirds through): a soft core porn film with lots of topless women and a funny in that kitchy 70\\'s way film. There is no grand art here. The movie was designed to make money and exploit a growing trend at the time to put nymphomaniacal stewardesses in films so that the audience could live out vicariously their voyeuristic tastes. By todays standards, the film is pretty tame. What this film DOES do wrong is try to be some kind of statement film at the end. C\\'mon, anyone here believing that little diatribe by Debbie while on the beach contemplating life. She would spend more time picking out which halter top she will wear that day then do that. And what about the ridiculous plot to steal 50 grand? It didn\\'t make sense to me so how on earth did these characters \"dig\" it? Anyone buying Cal as a member of the PLO(something like that) or even as a director for hardcore pornography? He would be luck to get work at Seven Eleven! This is, as another reviewer noted, more of a Sam Sherman piece then and Al Adamson piece. You can tell when Al is in complete charge. There is virtually no budget and the film doesn\\'t look nearly as polished as this. Adamson does a decent job directing this time and I have to give Sherman credit to a degree. While this film is bad just for what it was meant to be, it has a certain style to it. I liked the opening credits with the animation and photographs. I even liked the music of Sparrow. \"Silver Heels\" was a somewhat catchy tune. The movie doesn\\'t look cheap really at all. Compare that to ANY of Al\\'s horror films. As for the cast, yes, Bob Livingston is a bit old for the lead, but some examination went into his character and the obvious thread that young women are attracted to men with money was explored as well. I had major problems with Robert Smedley who was just plain awful in his role. The girls have all got great sets, so what else was required of them huh? Naughty Stewardesses is relatively harmless exploitation film from the 70\\'s and will serve as a living time capsule for certain aspects of life during that decade.

For the Goyas, for the Oscar. Is sad Spain couldn't present both! They would probably leave the Shrine with an ex-aequo award!<br /><br />The characters of Solas are very well written and definite. The huge heart of Rosa (the mother). And the also big heart but with more bad mood heart of María. A lady that seems to give up, until she understands that it could be even worse!<br /><br />The movie makes you feel lucky in some ways!

I\\'d like congratulate the director, Hayley Cloake, the lead actress, Izabella Miko and the lead actor, Austin Nichols on the amateurish attempt to adapt Poe.<br /><br />To classify this as a B-movie would be an insult to B-movies.

Frankly, if I wanted to see scantily-clad women walking around, I would watch a Victoria\\'s Secret fashion show. That would at least be visually stimulating and provide some entertainment. Miko is in dire need of acting classes. Someone needs to tell her that having a pretty face isn\\'t all you need to make it in Hollywood.

It\\'s easy to separate Derek from the guy who belts out hits on VH-1.<br /><br />I generally would not watch a horror movie. I\\'ve come to expect them to focus on sensationalistic gore rather than dialogue and plot. What pleased me most about this film was that there really was a viable plot being moved along. The gore is not so much as to become the focus of the film and does not have a disturbingly realistic quality of films with higher technical effects budgets. So, gore fans might be disappointed, but story fans will not.<br /><br />Unlike an action film like U-571 where the dialogue takes a back seat to the bombast, we get a chance to know \"the good guys\" and actually care what happens to them. A few scenes are left unexplained (like Derek\\'s hallucinations) but you get the feeling certain aspects were as they were to lay the foundation for a sequel.

The movie seems to run a little long in places and there are a couple of pointless plot points (the whole Dean Stockwell character), overall though and mainly it is a cool action movie in the same vein as Die Hard or other movies where you have the one free guy making trouble for the bad guys.

The passage of thirty years allows the telling to be backed up by an impressive and fascinating panoply of the very individuals involved, ranging from some of the highest military and political figures down to the field soldiers, civilians, and such survivors of the death camps as have remained to bear witness to the unimaginable inhumanities of which civilized humans are capable. Most approaching or well into their senior years, the interviewed subjects have had enough time to reflect on their experiences and in most instances have had enough time for whatever propaganda and fervor may have affected them in the past to have receded away, leaving only the memories of what they saw and what they did.<br /><br />The information that these survivors give, strikingly reinforced by the postures and expressions they display while telling their part, give their stories all the more impact. Such names as Ira Eaker, Adolph Galland, Louis Mountbatten, Albert Speer, Gertrude Junge (Hitler's personal secretary)... the list is far too long to relate. <br /><br />Today, within the lifetime of the survivors of this enormous lesson in the hideous price of political ambition, are young people who chant the same sort of militaristic and nationalistic war promotion as led to WW2. The DVD series we discuss here ought to comprise the core of a mandatory history subject in schools, that the lessons bought at such a horrible cost in those days should not have been wasted but should be taken to heart by those who did not see firsthand the terrible price.<br /><br />I am almost done watching the 11 disk set, having seen most of the series when a local TV channel aired it more than 10 years ago.

The woman is unaware that her cat has just been in an altercation with a fox, but back in the UK it begins to act odd. After a series of scenes involving the passing of the deadly virus from animal to animal, an American businessman Tom Siegler (Ed Bishop) resident in the UK comes across a seemingly stunned fox at the side of the road. The fox appears docile and is amiable to being petted, so Siegler takes him home, but the fox soon turns on him, Bishop becomes infected and is the first to die. The authorities become aware and immediately set in place some restrictions in the area, a cordon is placed within a five mile radius of his house. Michael Hilliard is a veterinary expert who is persuaded to take charge of the investigation and straight away he sets out to find anyone who came in contact with the dead man before he died, his actions and restrictions don\\'t go down well with local animal lovers and the press also make him out to be a bit of a loon. But as the virus spreads, he seems to be justified, but can he restrict the spread and make the country virus free again? In the 80\\'s there was a real fear that rabies aka \"The Mad Death\", might spread to the UK, there were frightening TV advertisements to warn and scare the public away from smuggling animals into the country from the continent where Rabies was widespread. A frightening premise for a film? well sure the reality of it is scary, but to make it as a horror The Mad Death really needed to push home the fear, sadly it doesn\\'t. The Fear element just isn\\'t explored, The Mad Death is called that for a reason, its a terrible death, but these factors are just not explored well enough to either strike fear into the viewer or to deter would be smugglers. Little or no tension is built up, too much time is spent early on showing in a rather dull way, how it spreads from fox to cat to fox to dog to human and so on, that soon the viewer will be asking what all the fuss is about. I can also say that I have never seen animal lovers portrayed in such a bad light, every single one in the Mad Death, is played as crazy or with murderous intentions, they have no interest in stopping the spread of the virus, even the merest of actions like keeping your dog indoors is treated with apathy and anger, all in all not very believable. The acting is stilted beyond belief, with numerous silences and laboured pauses, actors staring into space and these aren\\'t the ones that are infected. There\\'s also a love triangle going on that is dull in the extreme. The restrictions set in place by police and Dept of Agriculture are also quite laughable in their laxness, if such an outbreak occurred in reality, the UK would be absolutely doomed. Now i realize some elements of plot have to be there to further the story, but here it is pushed to ridiculous extremes. So has the Mad Death got anything going for it? well, there are a few interesting set pieces, a rabid fox locked in a garage, a rabid Alsatian loose in a shopping mall, spring to mind, but even these are lazily handled. In a time when viruses are a real threat to humanity, its hard to get scared by a poodle and a Labrador running wild in a forest. If the filmmakers were out to scare the audience they failed miserably, if they were out to educate the public as to the risks, they also failed as its a little too preachy',\n"," 'Great satire of the modern greek -tsifteteli, souvlaki, xavale- society given with a great political sense and fair doses of clever humour.

They learn all kinds of swear words and use them at all times. The rest of South Park kids see it also, and by the next school day, the parents find out and totally hate the movie. They form a group against the movie. It goes out from there. There is also a plot with Kenny going to hell, and finding Saddam Hussein and Satan in love. Saddam is a hornball. And Satan regrets the whole relationship.<br /><br />Crudity: Definitely for adults only. It probably has the most swear words than any other movie this year. It has cartoon nudity. It has breasts and wriggling penises. All cartoon, of course. It has violence galore by the end. Do not take your kids to see this, or be prepared to feel uncomfortable. All theaters must enforce the carding laws for this one. However, if none of this will offend you to the point of hatred, do not see this. It also has racism, sexism, and offends every group out there from the Gays to the MPAA to the parents.<br /><br />As a whole: The funniest movie so far of 1999. I laughed so hard. I found it only mildly offensive personally, but then I also love the movie \"Pink Flamingos.\" I cannot recommend this movie to everyone. I can recommend it to those who are not offended easily. This does not include the people who feel brave because they survived \"There\\'s Something About Mary.\" Parents will not like this movie unless they are completely open-minded, and I recommend not seeing it with your children. However, it is wonderful. I loved the musical format that they chose. Everywhere there is a song. Also stay past the credits, there is an after-scene. It is trying to be a \"Pink Flamingos.\" I love it but can only recommend it to the group from 17-30, male.----------------------------10',\n"," \"The first of the official Ghibli films, Laputa is most similar to its predecessor Nausicaa, but whereas Nausicaa was a SF epic, this is more of an action comedy-adventure with a fairly weak SF premise.<br /><br />For the first half hour of the movie I thought I was going to love it. Once again you find yourself in awe of Miyazaki's attention to detail, and his ability to conjure up an imaginary world in meticulous, beautiful perfection. The animation, though still not in the league of the later Ghibli films, is a little better than in Nausicaa.<br /><br />I mentioned in my review of Nausicaa that one character is drawn in a more 'Lupinesque' anime style. Here there are a whole bunch of them: the pirates. They provide the comic element in the film, though quite why it needs a comic element I'm not sure. There was nothing funny about Nausicaa, and I think it was better off for it. Still. having said that, Dola, the pirate leader, is easily the most memorable character in the film (even if she's basically a female Long John Silver. Don't be surprised if you're reminded of 'Treasure Planet' at times) and is well voiced by Cloris Leachman in the American dub.<br /><br />The English voice cast acquit themselves well for the most part, actually. However something started going pear-shaped for me about this movie by about the halfway mark. I think the best way that I could describe it is that the characters get swallowed up by the vast scope of the story. I'll come back to that later.<br /><br />There is so much to admire about Laputa, and so many people obviously love it, that I almost feel mean for only giving it 8 out of 10, but for me the operative word here is 'admire'. It was more impressive than personally affecting, and at over two hours it just started to drag.<br /><br />The crucial thing for me was this: I really found that I didn't care much about any of the characters. Disney would have taken the care to develop the characters, make you really fall for them, rather than leave them as relatively two-dimensional pieces to be moved around while you gawked at the amazing vistas in the movie. Even that would have been tolerable if there was some hard SF in the story to make up for it, but it was basically a lot of gobledegook about Princesses and magic crystals. That's where Laputa falls down as far as I'm concerned, and that's what holds it back from being a potential 10 out of 10 movie. Having said that, it must be admitted that Miyazaki was leagues ahead of Disney in general in 1986, when you consider that their movie of the same year was the pretty dire 'Great Mouse Detective'.<br /><br />Laputa is a good film in some ways an amazing film, and you should definitely see it, but I do feel it's over-rated. I definitely prefer the earlier 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind'.<br /><br />BTW, if you manage to watch them in chronological order, watch for the fox-squirrel from Nausicaa popping up briefly in Laputa.\",\n"," 'JOAN CRAWFORD returned to MGM for TORCH SONG after a decade of other films at other studios, in a role that paints her character as tough-as-nails--in fact, so tough that you expect her to take out a gun at any moment and shoot anyone who disagrees with her bossy persona. Not only is she tough, but the script is trite from beginning to end and the whole film is garishly lit in bright Technicolor to show off Joan\\'s wardrobe and a neat pair of legs. It all seems like a warm-up for JOHNNY GUITAR in lush settings rather than a saloon.<br /><br />That she can\\'t sing is obvious because it\\'s immediately apparent that a professional singer is doing the songs (India Adams). And despite her early days as a hoofer doing the Charleston and other dances during her flaming youth, it\\'s also easy to see that dancing is not her strong point. So she seizes the bitchy role of a dame who treats a blind pianist with such scorn that even his dog growls every time she comes near him.<br /><br />An appalling blackface number is enough to gag on (using a leftover track from a Cyd Charisse film that never made the final cut), and her confrontations with MICHAEL WILDING (the blind pianist), GIG YOUNG (a drunken playboy, what else?), HARRY MORGAN (a stage manager/agent) and MARJORIE RAMBEAU as her plain speaking mother, are all strictly theatrical, harsh and unconvincing.<br /><br />One thing I\\'ll say--she does \"haughty\" and \"overbearing\" so well, that it\\'s hard to remember that in real life she was so afraid of further humiliation by the cast and crew of HUSH...HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE, that she left the film and feigned illness to get out of playing the role of Cousin Miriam. She also pleaded illness when she was afraid to attend the Academy Awards--afraid she might lose--but put her make-up on for the cameras when the radio announcement came that she won.<br /><br />Nobody looks good in this one--but speaking of Academy Awards, MARJORIE RAMBEAU got nominated for her mother role here. She\\'s not bad, but it must have been a dreary year for Best Supporting Actresses.<br /><br />This one belongs near the bottom of Joan\\'s career and surely any sane person would want to miss it--leaving it entirely to Crawford\\'s ardent die-hard fans who think this is high camp.<br /><br />Particularly unbelievable and jarring is the ending, which has Crawford and Wilding realizing that they love each other after all the harsh words and deeds are over!!

Its oddly tense in some dimensions and relaxed in others and the balance between the two seems distinctly Australian. I hadn\\'t seen this when it was new, and I\\'m glad. Seeing a great film for the first time is a distinct pleasure.<br /><br />I can think of only two similar pleasures in life.<br /><br />Reviewers often focus on the story; its the common currency for discussion. The interesting fact behind the power of this movie is that the story is incoherent, poorly developed. There are a few main characters and none of them are attached to what are considered necessities for storytelling. They aren\\'t introduced, we see them only through the effect of their presence. They don\\'t develop. They influence nothing.<br /><br />The main character is presented as a sort of Jane Austen \\x97 both an Austen woman encouraged to marry, and Austen herself as a sort of author-in-her-own-book, like we saw in the 1999 film of Mansfield Park. But the odd thing is that we have Austen in Australia, the role and all the expectations without the baroque mechanics of society swirling around. Instead we get cows and sheep.<br /><br />And emptiness, a cinematic vastness that even the US hasn\\'t yet produced, despite Terence Malick.<br /><br />So the incompleteness of the story is part of the genius of the thing. Our heroine doesn\\'t have an Austenian future, instead becomes a backcountry Louisa May Alcott or George Sand. Indeed, Davis did go on to play Sand and Anderson went on to direct \"Little Women.\" What our filmmaker has done is create a story where we subconsciously notice something is missing. And then she fills it with two things, this translucent actress and a similarly translucent open landscape.<br /><br />First the landscape. Watch the opening of this. Its genius, shooting from outside in, peering in through windows and doors while we see \\x97 literally \\x97 the story beginning to be written. Then we shoot from the inside through the same windows out and see a dust tempest beginning.<br /><br />This notion of space, inadequate enclosure, book and heroine conflated into them and weaving through them was copied after a fashion in the opening for the 2005 \"Pride and Prejudice.\" Here, it is fresh, original, shocking. Effective, even life-affirming.<br /><br />You can see a similar master vision in how the ending is shaped. We see our woman, a best friend by this time, going to mail her book to us. She approaches the fence and her dog scurries under, unconstrained by fences. Its a small thing, but by then we\\'ve become aware of how wonderfully our hidden woman behind the camera has shaped everything so minutely. That dog moves under the gate naturally, using a gait and hole that can only have come through hundreds of such exits. I have no idea how Anderson did it.<br /><br />And now to Ms. Davis. Over time you pick things from the film vocabulary that you cleave to, things that naturally tip into the bucket of your soul. One of these for me is a certain type of folded acting I\\'ve noticed in Australian actresses. Blanchett, Winslet are the ones I follow deeply.<br /><br />But you can see it here and I imagine that this is the first appearance of the style in a competent film. In my own historiography, Judy Davis invented it and does so here. If you watch her manner, you can see Cate. The style is what I call folded, where we get both the character and a higher level communication from the actor about the character.<br /><br />We have a few folded actresses. What\\'s even rarer is when the actress is intelligent and skilled enough to place that higher fold in the center of the filmmaker\\'s intention. It happens here. Its beautiful, on a simpler level echoing the fact that we see a book, its making, and various considerations about the making of the book.<br /><br />Because it is this sort of translucent folding, we see Cate when we see Judy.<br /><br />You won\\'t soon forget that.<br /><br />I\\'m putting this on my list of films you really must see. Readers may be shocked. I only allow myself two from any given years and this year gave us \"Alien,\" \"Apocalypse Now,\" \"Manhattan,\" and \"Tree of Wooden Clogs,\" all of which are bumped by this.

One of the major plot points was for the aliens to find children (in the present time) that could \"hear\" them and take them to another world before the cataclysmic end of our planet. So why did they need to appear 50 years ago and leave a cryptic message with dates of varying catastrophes? Just so Cage\\'s character can figure it out and let his kid go? How about all the other ships with other kids? They get their own puzzles? How come the girl who was able to hear them 50 years ago was not part of the expeditionary force but instead was left to suffer for all her life? In other words, everything leading up to the end of the movie was not a necessary element for the ending. No logic here at all and a real downer of a movie. A couple of stars given for special effects (which for the most part had nothing to do with the premise of the movie).

She meets the disturbed German-American Jewish architect David Kovac (Elliott Gould), who is restoring a church in her town, and has recently become friend of her husband. David has drinking and smoking problems and after a dinner party at the Vergerus's home, he confesses his infatuation for Karin to her. This declaration revives her sensuality and femininity, which were forgotten after fifteen years of stable and loyal marriage. Karin has an affair with David, tearing apart her world: in one side, she has the stability and safety of her boring marriage and bourgeois life, and in the other side, she has the freedom of the relationship with her lover. She has lots of difficulties to decide the course of her life. This magnificent open end film is another wonderful work of Ingmar Bergman, his first English spoken movie. Bibi Andersson, Max von Sydow and Elliott Gould have again outstanding performances in a touching story about a thirty-four years woman divided in two possible lives and without knowing how to decide the way to be followed. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): `A Hora do Amor' (`The Hour of the Love')\",\n"," 'With the release of Peter Jackson\\'s famed \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, it is even easier to dismiss Ralph Bakshi\\'s 1978 animated Lord of the Rings film as inferior. I agree with the majority that Jackson\\'s trilogy is the essential film adaptation of Tolkien\\'s work, but that does not prevent me from enjoying Bakshi\\'s ambitious pioneering effort. Jackson has admitted that he received at least some inspiration from seeing Bakshi\\'s film and there are some clear similarities between their adaptations.<br /><br />The film\\'s colorful picturesque backdrops are excellent and the score is memorable. I was for the most part satisfied by the drawings of the characters. The pairs of Pippin and Merry and Eowyn and Galadriel are mostly indistinguishable from each other visually, the Balrog and Treebeard were unimpressive, but these points didn\\'t bother me very much. However, the Nazgul are aptly drawn and made sufficiently eerie. The only character representation I was bothered by was Sam\\'s; he was made to look unbecomingly silly.<br /><br />This film is novel for its animation techniques. In addition to hand-drawn characters, live actors are incorporated into the animation through rotoscoping. It is quite apparent which characters are hand-drawn and which are rotoscoped, but none the less I found that the film\\'s style was a novelty. The use of rotoscoped live actors for the battle scenes was a good decision and helped these scenes turn out well.<br /><br />The voice acting was generally of high quality. Particularly good was John Hurt, who provided an authoritative voice for Aragorn. Aragorn isn\\'t a favorite character of mine from the stories, but backed by John Hurt\\'s voice he was my favorite character in this adaptation. My other favorite was William Squire, whose voice is appropriately strong for Gandalf. The only actor who seemed inappropriate was Michael Scholes as Sam, whose voice acting was irritating and added to Sam\\'s unfortunately silly image. The only other bothersome part of the voice acting is the mispronunciation of character and place names. Particularly strange was the decision to frequently have Saruman referred to as \"Aruman\".<br /><br />In producing this film, Ralph Bakshi expected to have the ability to produce two films. Hence, this film contains about half the story, from the start of \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" to the end of the battle at Helm\\'s Deep in \"The Two Towers\". The obvious implication of this is that the film\\'s story is a highly condensed version of the story from the books. I enjoy the original stories and more thorough adaptations, but the liberties taken to compress the story didn\\'t bother me, even the choice to leave Arwen out of the story. Enough of the key elements of the story were in this film to keep me engaged for the duration and there was even a novelty in being able to breeze through half the Lord of the Rings story in 132 minutes. The battle scenes were impressive and in particular the orc march to and battle at Helm\\'s Deep were tremendous.<br /><br />Ralph Bakshi\\'s version of \"The Lord of the Rings\" isn\\'t perfect and no doubt a number of Lord of the Rings readers lament the cuts to the story. However, for me the drawbacks of this film were minor compared to the thrill of seeing an effective adaptation of half of a great trilogy. My only strong lament is that I am unable to see the second part of this \"first great tale\" of The Lord of the Rings since Bakshi was not given the budget to create a sequel.',\n"," 'During the Civil War, there were many cases of divided loyalties; obviously, many occurred \"In the Border States\", where North met South by happenstance of geography.

Jones's premise of an item taken from the Long Island house that causes spectral misery and death for its new owners. First a lamp, then a clock, and now a mirror. However, this is also the first Amityville since 'The Possession' to directly tie in to the real- life events that started the whole series. This time around, Keyes Terry (Robert Partridge), an artist, is given a macabre-looking mirror by a homeless man one day. Soon enough, people around him start to die, eventually leading to his discovery that the mirror once hung in the Amityville house - indeed on the very night a man named Franklin Bronner (Sonny Montelli in 'Amityville II') murdered his entire family. Unfortunately for Terry, his discovery of the mirror isn't entirely coincidental, and he soon learns the truth about his past a truth he's kept buried since childhood.<br /><br />This 7th installment in the often worn-out franchise is something of a disappointment for me. Things were starting to pick up with the silly and uneven, yet entertaining 'It's About Time', and given how much this film tries to draw upon its roots - not the first episode, but the source material itself - it should have been better than it was. <br /><br />However, three trips to the same well with yet another evil artifact from the Amityville house with yet another explanation for the malign paranormal visitations is wearing on me, to say the least. One of the biggest weaknesses of the Amityville franchise is the steadfast determination by each set of producers to completely ignore every other episode in the series. On the one hand, it's perfectly reasonable that they don't want to be tied to someone else's continuity, but at the very least, they could maybe acknowledge story lines that have already been done and just possibly *not repeat them over and over again*.<br /><br />There's also something rather plodding about the way in which the story unfolds, doubtless due to the inevitability this repetition-fest brings. Since you already know what's going to happen, the carefully-paced build-up is simply slow and tedious. Or maybe it's just tedious anyway. Director John Murlowski probably could have done more to heighten the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror rather than simply having it flash red and emit chattering 'evil' voices, which lacks any kind of subtlety. There were times when characters seemed fairly unfazed by its otherworldly qualities. If they don't take it too seriously, why should we?<br /><br />Which is a shame, because 'A New Generation' has a more-than-capable cast. I was going to hold off on watching this until I saw the name 'Julia Nickson' in the credits. She captivated my attention just as she always does, and if anything, I was annoyed her part wasn't more extensive. Terry O'Quinn was equally charismatic and again, underused. Partridge himself in the lead role clearly fits the early 90s over-coiffed lumberjack-shirted square-jawed hero type, and while I'm not sure he really gave it the gravitas needed, it's not as if anyone here is performing Ibsen.<br /><br />The sets are also worthy of note, from the dramatic artwork filling Suki's room, to the claustrophobic corridors featured in flashback/supernatural sequences. Getting the look of these right is especially important given how certain sequences are repeated throughout the film to simulated fragmented memories. Clearly, Murlowski is more of a visual director rather than either an actor's director or one of horror. Unfortunately, it is meant to be a horror film, after all.<br /><br />'A New Generation' sees the same race being run for the third time in 4 years. Add to this the lack of direction where it was really needed and the whole effort fails to stand as tall as it should. However, it should be acknowledged for its strong ties with the source material and some good actors in not necessarily their finest hours. Honestly, the ideal person for this is someone who hasn't seen any of the sequels past 'The Possession', for whom the story won't be such a massive deja-vu trip.\",\n"," \"If the director wasn't Claude Chabrol, I'm not sure this picture would have been released. It's a mystery story with a rather common theme. Ordinary man meets strange girl with secrets and his values tend to change in dangerous ways, because of the passion.<br /><br />But the acting alienates the viewer. The dialog and the facial expressions don't mix together and you can't take the theme seriously. That's a problem in many French movies and not at least those of Chabrol. Maybe it's because one is too used to American actor manners, but I'm not sure that's really the problem here.<br /><br />Passions can be boring and this is unfortunately an example.\",\n"," \"This movie gives golf a high mark, it was well acted and well directed.

Despite an ominous welcome from the forest ranger (Jackson Bostwick) the kids troop up to the mountain any way. Before long, the kids start to get picked off by the monster, who remains unseen to the very end of the movie, probably because the makeup was so embarrassingly bad. No surprises to speak of: they get killed in the exact order that the formula for these movies dictates, leaving the \"final girl\" to fend for herself, although in a refreshingly downbeat denouement, the final girl ends up imprisoned and impregnated by the monster.<br /><br />The story itself couldn\\'t hold the weight of feature length, so it was padded out by seemingly endless shots of wildlife and insects, which were obviously shot for another film and inserted here haphazardously as a means of making the movie long enough for a video release. On the plus side, the wildlife footage is rather nice. Also among the highlights are Bostwick talking to a baby deer, a decent rock-climbing death sequence, OK gore, and the Great Jackie Coogan in his final film role, as the bumbling local sheriff.

I am always pursuing the fact that words are so important in movies since filmmakers started using them because, basically, there\\'s no film without a screenplay and many other reasons.<br /><br />Cassavetes pursued the same goal, and he believed in the freedom of words; \"Shadows\" is the perfect example. It\\'s a film with no real main characters, with no real main plot lines; it\\'s mostly people in different situations, talking. Yes, some of the situations are connected but Cassavetes, apparently always in a rush to get to the talking, uses a fast forward technique when the characters are going somewhere or escaping from someone and are not speaking.<br /><br />Appearances are everything in this movie. For example, there\\'s a brilliant score, full of jazz influences and a lot of fantastic solos, and there\\'s one character that says he\\'s a jazz musician and plays the trumpet (Ben, all the characters\\' names are the same names the actors\\'). However, we never see him play the trumpet or jam with a band; he doesn\\'t even talk about music and just wanders with his friends around the city. They do talk, a lot, and about anything that\\'s in their minds; going from how intelligent each of them are to the hilarious analysis of a sculpture.<br /><br />\"Shadows\" is funny in its intellectual references in parts like the one above, because these friends are not cultured. The only important female character in the film (Lelia), though, wants to be an intellectual. But again, she has one very interesting conversation with an older man at a party, about a book she\\'s trying to write, and about how to confront reality; but nothing to do with being intellectual. At that same party, a woman is actually making an intellectual statement, full of complexity, and asks a guy beside her: \"Do you agree?\". \"Yes\", he says, but you can tell he doesn\\'t know what she\\'s talking about.<br /><br />Another character, a singer (Hugh), talks about his glory days in occasions, and we see him perform only once; but no references to the musical industry there. The focus of Cassavetes is the singer\\'s relationship with his manager (Rupert), which most of the time involves chats about trivial stuff and not real \\'musical\\' talks. So the trumpet player\\'s important deal in \"Shadows\" is the time he spends with his friends; the intellectual wannabe girl\\'s is her way of handling romantic relationships (one of the movie\\'s strong points) and the singer\\'s is the bond with his manager\\x85Appearances.<br /><br />The reason why performances are not important in this movie is simple. Cassavetes needed people who could master improvisation, without mattering if they were actually good. I believe some of them aren\\'t, but they surely know how to improvise in a scene, and you can notice how well they do it. \"Shadows\" is not about performers; it\\'s about a way of making cinema, based on the magic of conversation; and there you could say that performances mean something.<br /><br />That\\'s why in every conversation the camera is like a stalker, constantly on the eyes of every character, constantly looking for the expressions that come with natural speech. There\\'s a scene where the trumpet player and his friends are trying to pick up some girls. They are three, so each of them sits beside one girl (the girls are three two) in three different tables. They all talk at the same time and the camera shoots through the table, and sometimes the friends look at each other, while they say whatever they are saying\\x85It\\'s natural.',\n"," 'Slick, tidy, and well-made old school version of how a great international thriller should be made. Determined to nail a feared global terrorist who is known as \"Carlos the Jackal\", Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland, \"Without Limits\", \"Space Cowboys\"), a CIA operative and his Israeli counterpart, Amos (Ben Kingsley, \"Gandhi\", \"Sexy Beast\") get a noble Naval officer, Annibal Ramirez (Aidan Quinn, \"Music of the Heart\"), to become Carlos and use him in a daring plot to get the KGB to kill the real Carlos, because he took an offer from the CIA. Sutherland and Kingsley are both good here, but the movie really belongs to Quinn here, who embodies himself here (in a dual role). Director Christian Duguay and cinematographer David Franco provide another great asset of the film here with Hitchcockian-like suspense and great sights of the world.',\n"," 'Humorous film involving a spirited young woman by the name of Flora, who brings her stylish views of living, to the oppressed residents of a country farm.

My favorite: \"...Drain the well, there\\'s a neighbor missing...\" The script is very slick, and the performances are even better. If you enjoy offbeat humor mixed with a really sweet story, you\\'ll like this movie.',\n"," 'Certainly expected more after seeing the cast list, but WOW!<br /><br />I think a first time director could have done a better job with this project, and the fact that a veteran like John Buechler made it, puzzles me to no end. Somehow, the budget allowed them to secure a bevy of D-List actors, whom they succeeded in embarrassing for an hour and a half. The unknown actors were just plain awful, less Steve Wastell who does a decent job as Axl. The story is so bad, that it really needs no mention. The overall production value seems standard, with some above average camera work, if you can make it through the God-Awful \"slo-mo\" scenes and the painful \"person on fire\" sequences. I knew it would be dumb, I just had no idea how dumb, and unfortunately it\\'s time spent that can never be returned to me. I suppose if you enjoy really bad \"B\" films, this might work for you, but if you value any story at all, this one is simply dreadful... A complete waste of time.',\n"," 'Ever since I was a little boy, I was a big fan of the Three Stooges. I had seen every movie they ever made, except \"Kook\\'s Tour.\" When it was finally released on video in 1999, my jaw nearly hit the floor. Unfortunately, my hopes were too high for what I was about to see. Billed as \"Their last and funniest film,\" the Stooges simply take a camping trip and that\\'s about it. Larry Fine suffered a stroke and was unable to complete the filming, so Norman Maurer filled the remaining time with scenery and narration by Moe Howard. \"Kook\\'s Tour\" is indeed an important piece of Stooge history, but it is not a worthwhile film.',\n"," 'All in all, an excellent movie from that time and source (coming from Warner Brothers as it was peaking in craftsmanship and style just before WWII), provided you don\\'t take it at all seriously. The movie really makes no claim to being historically accurate, and is certainly no more or less accurate or believable than say, JFK. (This one may actually be more honest about it, though, as it essentially admits along the way that it\\'s not to be taken as particularly fact-based, but more of a stylishly semi-heroic portrayal.) It\\'s worth noting that audiences of the time were no more naive about the story than we are today; the NY Times review conceded that audiences would \"dismiss factual inaccuracies sprinkled throughout the film,\" described the biographical account of Custer\\'s life as \"fanciful,\" and pointed out that the presentation of Custer\\'s motivations regarding the final events were at odds with various historical accounts. They could have really gone overboard in building up Custer, one supposes, but they succeed admirably in depicting him as not necessarily the sharpest or most diligent guy around, but appropriately determined, principled and inspirational.<br /><br />Flynn and DeHavilland, doing their 8th movie together in 7 years (and their last), are so comfortable together, and play off each other so easily at this point, that it\\'s not too difficult to overlook how thinly their courtship is written here. With a first-time pairing, it would be hard to imagine what could really draw Elizabeth to Custer, but these two make it work. The movie is also missing their director from their previous seven films together (the greatly underrated Michael Curtiz), but given that he had worked with them on the previous year\\'s similar-themed Santa Fe Trail, it\\'s understandable if he chose to opt out of this one. (They all started together with Captain Blood and The Charge of the Light Brigade - both terrific - so we can\\'t really blame them if they started having a tough time keeping it all fresh.)<br /><br />Raoul Walsh, the director here, is certainly more comfortable with the action sequences - which are outstanding - and everything else outdoors. The interior scenes are a little more uneven, but the studio craftsmen succeed in compensating for that very well, as does Warner Bros\\' outstanding cast of \"usual suspects\" and new faces (Greenstreet, Gene Lockhart, Anthony Quinn, Arthur Kennedy, etc). I would have liked it better if Kennedy\\'s character had been a bit less standard (I generally like his work), but here he seems to be hitting roughly the same notes in every scene; the part could have been better written - and I suppose they might have been unsure of what he could handle, as he\\'d only been in films for one year (Walsh probably took him for this after doing High Sierra together).<br /><br />Various highlights include the depiction (probably imagined) of the genesis of \"Garryowen\" as the cavalry theme. The last half hour is particularly outstanding, especially with the parting of the leads echoing the end of their screen partnership, followed by the final battle scenes. A thoroughly rousing adventure.<br /><br />8 of 10',\n"," 'A fierce, shockingly intelligent piece of work from the gifted British writer Hanif Kureishi who wrote \"My Beautiful Laundrette\", (this is the best thing he\\'s done since then). It\\'s about intelligent people whose lives don\\'t add up to much. They\\'ve squandered what they have been given and are largely empty vessels. The only character on screen who is alive is the mother of the title yet she feels dead inside until a rough handyman shows her some affection and awakens her to the joys of sex. He has his own motives but Kureishi treats him with a good deal of compassion. This is a film in which people and places feel familiar, where characters exist beyond the confines of the screen. In some respects it\\'s a bit like \"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\" but it\\'s an altogether tougher piece of work. The director, Roger Michell, allows scenes to build instinctively. And it is beautifully acted.<br /><br />As the eponymous mother Anne Reid betrays her wasted life in every gesture. There is not a false note in her extraordinarily lived-in performance, and that very fine actor Daniel Craig displays shadings to his character than even Kureishi hasn\\'t tapped into. If the film strikes a false note it is, perhaps, in the character of the talentless daughter, caught up in a messy affair with the man her mother seduces (or should that be the other way round) and even messier life, but she is so well played by Cathryn Bradshaw she hooks you in nevertheless. The film is also extremely beautiful to look at (DoP Alwin Kuchler) and must rank, unhesitatingly, as the best British film of the year.',\n"," 'Boris Karloff gives a good performance as General Feredes,one of several people he quarantines on a small island where his wife is buried.

Claustrophobic and atmospheric,guaranteed to send a shiver down your spine.',\n"," \"Martha Plimpton has done some prestigious movies, working with River Phoenix and Harrison Ford, but she was never able to expand her limited, tomboyish appeal into the same class as, say, Molly Ringwald. This film, which was barely released, is just an extension of her late '80s/early '90s attempts to find a screen-persona which was identifiable to moviegoers, and it represents another failure. Plimpton plays a troubled young woman who finds out on her 21st birthday that she was adopted and--worse than that--was actually abandoned as an infant on her parents' doorstep! She sets out to find her biological mother and father, but the viewer has no clue why she'd even want to (would simple curiosity give her this much determination?). Unattractive material given sitcom handling; it starts off on the wrong foot and never recovers. Plimpton gives a sour, surly performance, but Hector Elizondo and Mary Kay Place are fine as her adoptive parents. *1/2 from ****\",\n"," \"Hello everyone, This is my first time posting and I just love the movie No child of mine and I could watch it over and over!! well I taped it a long time ago like a few years ago and I dropped it and broke it and I haven't seen it in a few years!! could any one please tell me when it will come on again!!

It is the sort of film that gives 'art house' films a bad name.<br /><br />The acting is wooden throughout though worse than usual as it appears as if all the actors have been heavily doped with some sedative the slow, deliberate way they ponderously shuffle about. The dialogue is wholly unconvincing but, sadly, only occasionally risibly so.<br /><br />There were a couple of highlights. In one scene there's an interestingly designed basket of lemons hanging on the wall - I had time to commit to memory and it might work well as a wire basket. There are also numerous scenes of somebody playing billiards with himself (no, not pocket billiards!) on a real billiard table. You don't see many of those about these days.<br /><br />They don't seem to have been clear about what language the film was supposed to be spoken in. It mainly has rhotic 'r's, but not always. It is beyond me why, when they were supposed to be French, they didn't just hire real French actors and actresses - even if they then tried to speak English it would have been more authentic sounding. It would have been better in the original language with sub-titles.<br /><br />The garden looked just like you'd expect a hastily prepared film-set garden to look - quite unconvincing.<br /><br />The beard continuity is all over the place. The lead robot grows several beards that all look different.<br /><br />On top of all these failings, it is nastily, gooilly sickly- sentimental. Mawkishness drives almost every scene.<br /><br />I wish somebody had told me to avoid this film. See it only if you want a kip.<br /><br />Somebody must have bribed somebody a vast amount not to have this sent straight to DVD.<br /><br />Amazingly the director also directed 'The Red Violin', a first rate film in almost every way - he must have been drinking himself into a coma every day since then or had a nasty accident that damaged his brain. <br /><br />Do not be misled by the comments suggesting that this is artistic or worth watching!\",\n"," 'This movie was excellent.

This is a graphic movie. It presents an unsensationalized picture of violence and it\\'s tragic remains. Nothing is \"candy-coated\" with overdone blood or gore to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen. This movie is based on Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo.

That\\'s all I want to say about the film, the rest is about the performance of the masterful Considine.<br /><br />In this movie (and, almost equally, in A Room For Romeo Brass) Paddy Considine outshines practically every other actor with career opportunities in the early part of the 21st century. He will gain your sympathy, wring emotion from you, terrify you and leave you slack-jawed and in awe of his talent as he burns through the screen to face everyone and everything with a blatant disregard for his own personal safety.<br /><br />This movie resonates so much with me because I know many little, ultimately insignificant, \"hard men\" like those shown here, the big fish in little ponds who would not last 5 minutes outside their comfort zone. And Considine drags them outside that zone, bloodied, kicking and screaming.<br /><br />Part bodycount flick, part emotional drama, part vengeance movie, it all adds up to one of the most satisfying pieces of work that the UK has provided since . . . . well, since goodness knows when.

I don\\'t remember seeing any advertisements or commercials for this one which could be the reason why it didn\\'t do so well at the box office. However, Frailty is an excellent and a truly original horror movie. I rank it within the top 10 most favorite horror movies on my list.<br /><br />Movie begins with snapshots of photos and news articles telling us about a killer who calls himself \"God\\'s hand\". And then a man walks into a police station and tells the chief officer that he knows the killer is his brother. Two of them leave together to go to a location where victims are buried which might help solve the case. During that trip, the man begins telling the story of his brother and we go back in time when the events began. Fenton and Adam are two young brothers living with their strict and religious father who, one day, claims that he has received a divine message from God asking him to kill the demons that appear to be regular human beings. He receives from God a list of names of demons to be destroyed and asks his sons to help him carry out this divine mission.<br /><br />This is an absolutely horrifying and suspenseful film that will keep you at the edge of your seat. The tension runs high, innocent people (or demons?) get killed and religious experiences are questioned. It has not one but few very intelligent twists at the end. If you like this genre, I highly recommend Frailty for you. I own the DVD and it is one of my all time favorite horror-thrillers.',\n"," 'Oh,God!

The chemistry between the two is very good.<br /><br />Director Kyeong-hyeong Kim uses some CG-inserts to pepper up the visuals and also offers impressive fight scenes in which Sang-woo Kwon can shine. I liked him a lot better here than in the highly overrated \"Volcano High\". And that boy has a future - those looks, those fight techniques, and a romantic lead.

It\\'s self-consciousness is obvious in every frame: \"see what a profound, sophisticated film we are making,\" the director and screenwriters seem to be saying to us, and to themselves they say, \"lets\\'s see how we can bore and confuse the audience even more.\" I would rather watch the worst film by Ed Wood or Edgar G. Ulmer than something like this. At least they were giving us honest trash, and at least their films, in their own atrocious way, were entertaining. This film is about as entertaining as a root canal without anesthesia, and thus is tantamount to torture.<br /><br />Have these screenwriters ever heard the word \\'story?\\' It doesn\\'t appear so. They have a concept, they are able to create an atmosphere, and they were able to assemble an excellent cast and elicit good performances from them. And for what? To bore us for an hour and 45 minutes? Nothing really happens in this film. The only exciting part, and this lasts only about two minutes, occurs when one of the soon-to-be-evicted homeowners starts shooting at the state employees who come to tell him he has to leave. But nothing comes of it. Too bad he didn\\'t keep shooting until he hit the screenwriters. The only redeeming features of this film are the acting and some beautifully photographed scenery toward the end. 3/10',\n"," 'Anyone new to the incredibly prolific Takashi Miike\\'s work might want to think twice about making this startling film their first experience of this truly maverick director. In keeping with Miike\\'s working practice of taking any work that comes his way and then grafting his own sensibilities onto the script, this is at heart a fairly basic yakuza thriller, with a morally ambiguous cop chasing a gang which his lawyer brother has fallen in with. What takes the movie out of the realms of the same-old same-old however, is the utterly unflinching attitude so some of the most sudden and horrific violence seen in today\\'s cinema. And this isn\\'t that nice cool, clean violence so beloved of US cinema - this stuff is nasty, painful and HURTS! That said, the pace is breakneck, the characters are unusual without being just being burdened with stock eccentricities, Miike\\'s sense of humour reveals itself and the most unexpected moments, and his camera is never quite where you expect it to be, making it hard to look away from the screen, whatever he might be showing you! It doesn\\'t have the \"Ohmigod\" ending of \"Dead Or Alive,\" but if you\\'re not squeamish, now\\'s the time to get on board the Miike bandwagon before he ends up on some Hollywood studio\\'s \"new John Woo\" shopping list...',\n"," \"022: The Circus (1928) - released 1/6/1928; viewed 8/28/05.<br /><br />Gandhi visits Ceylon, now Sri Lanka.

But at the end of The Circus, he doesn't get the riches or the girl. Instead the little Tramp just keeps going.<br /><br />DOUG: As '27 ends and '28 begins, Charlie Chaplin releases his latest Tramp adventure, The Circus. Naturally I didn't enjoy this as much as the other Chaplin films we've watched. I did enjoy the high wire sequence; you can't go wrong with monkeys.

I actually spent a few hours on set watching this being filmed and had a much more interesting time than I did watching it. In a word, like the previous years Hound of the Baskervilles, it was remarkably MISCAST. Worst still, its very, very cheap; you can tell this by the vast amount of fog pumped into every frame to cover the lack of extras. It probably cost about half of what one episode of the Granada T.V. series cost and besides, Jeremy Brett\\'s Holmes would have solved the case in the pre-credit sequence. Actually, come to think about it, the case is utterly ridiculous. Not Holmesian in the slightest. Aparrantly the production team\\'s thinking was since they had made (well, ruined) the best of the Sherlock Holmes stories the previous year (The Hound of the Baskervilles, you know the one, the one where Holmes hardly turns up at all, best my eye!) They\\'d have to make up their own. Let us just hope and prey the don\\'t do it again. Oh, an if you\\'re interested (you won\\'t be) it was twins what done it!

Mitchum was one of the detectives in the SFPD Homicide Squad and had a peripheral role in the first two films.

It's part of the new look the SFPD is being given. She's quite the inexperienced klutz at first, something Clint doesn't really need. In the end she really does redeem herself. And Clint loses a bit off the testosterone here. <br /><br />The final shootout with the militants who've hidden out on deserted Alcatraz Island is the best climax of any of the Dirty Harry films. The Enforcer's got the best ending of any Dirty Harry film.<br /><br />As you gather some punks chose to try their luck with Dirty Harry.\",\n"," 'Korine\\'s established himself, by now, as a talented and impressive image-maker. The promotional posters for Mister Lonely all include the film\\'s most impressive compositions (though there\\'s one in particular I\\'ve yet to see in promo material: that of a blue-clad nun teasing a dog with a stick, surrounded by green forest with torrential rain pouring down). The opening images of this film, of Michael Jackson lookalike (Diego Luna) riding a small motorbike round a track, is strangely compelling and beautiful: Roy Orbison\\'s \"Mister Lonely\" plays on the soundtrack, and the images unfold in slow-motion. There\\'s also a funny and terrific sequence in which the same character mimes a dance, without music (though a radio sits like a silent dog next to him), in the middle of a Paris street; Korine splices in sound effects and jump-cuts that evoke both a feeling of futility and dogged liberation in the character\\'s dance routine.<br /><br />The first instance of the segment dealing with the nuns is also strangely poignant; Father Umbrillo (Werner Herzog) is an autocratic priest about to fly with some nuns over, and drop food into, impoverished areas nearby. In a scene that is both light-hearted and affecting, Herzog must deal with a stubbornly enthusiastic local who wishes to make the plane trip with them in order to see his wife in San Francisco. As the exchange develops, Herzog draws out of the man a confession: he has sinned, and his frequent infidelity is the cause of his wife having left him in the first place. This scene, short and sweet, gains particular weight after one learns its improvised origins: the sinner is played by a non-actor who was on set when Korine and co. were filming - and his adulterous ways had given him, in real life, a lasting, overwhelming guilt.<br /><br />Henceforth, the film is hit-and-miss; a succession of intrinsically interesting moments that add to a frivolous, muddled narrative. Whereas Gummo and Julien Donkey-Boy maintain their aesthetic and emotional weight via coherent structural frameworks, Mister Lonely feels like a victim of editing room ruthlessness. A few scenes were cut from the film, which would have otherwise painted fuller pictures of certain characters, due to continuity errors in costume - a result, no doubt, due to the absence of a shooting script and Korine\\'s tendency for improvisation. One deleted scene in particular - in which \\'Charlie Chaplin\\' (Denis Lavant) and \\'Madonna\\' (Melita Morgan) have sex - would have added much more emotional conflict to a scene later on in the film (I won\\'t spoil it, but it\\'s there to deflate any feeling of warmth or celebration, and, as it is, only half-succeeds).<br /><br />The two strands of the narrative, unconnected literally, are best approached as two entirely different stories with the same allegorical meaning; one compliments the other and vice versa. (It\\'s something to do with the conflict between one\\'s ambitions and the reality of the current situation.) But there\\'s not enough of the Herzog scenes to merit their place in the film, and so any connection between these two allegorically-connected threads is inevitably strained - and the inclusion is, in retrospect, tedious.<br /><br />This is an ambitious step forward from Julien Donkey-Boy that suffers mostly, at least in the lookalike segments, from having far too many characters for the film\\'s running length, a flaw that would have been even worse had big star names played everyone (as was originally planned).<br /><br />With many of the imagery\\'s self-contained beauty, and moments of real, genuine connection with the soundtrack, this feels like it\\'d be much more suited to an art installation or photo exhibition. As an exploration of mimesis and the nature of impersonation, it\\'d lose none of its power - indeed, for me, it would perhaps be more impressive. The loneliness attached to iconic performativity (such as that encountered by both the icons themselves and those who aspire to be like them) is well-captured in images such as that wherein \\'Marilyn Monroe\\' (a gorgeous Samantha Morton) seduces the camera with a Seven Year Itch pose in the middle of a forest, or when \\'Sammy Davis, Jr.\\' (Jason Pennycooke) settles, post-dance rehearsal, with his back to the camera overlooking an incredible, tranquil lake.<br /><br />As it is, moments like these, and all those where the titles of randomly-chosen Michael Jackson songs crawl across the scene, are married to one another in a film narrative far less affecting than it should be.<br /><br />(For those who see it, I lost all faith during the egg-singing scene, late on. You\\'ll know which scene I mean because it sticks out like a sore thumb, as some sort of gimmicky attempt at the new cinematic language for which Korine has previously been hailed.)',\n"," 'Such was the question occurring to me as I struggled through yet another disastrously ridiculous SciFi Channel disaster movie. Do they intend for their homegrown movies to be so cheap, so silly, so patently obvious in what passes for plot?

Disaster Zone: Volcano in New York, however, brings bad into a new light.<br /><br />Every hackneyed device of disaster movie development is employed to predictable, hackneyed affect: the hero, a burly tunnel digger, leads his crew of rough-but-capable misfits (Local 147 \"Sand Hogs\") in a daring race against the volcano to save New York City from certain incineration by lava. Along the way, he encounters his bitter ex-wife, a USGS PhD who, apparently, is woefully unfamiliar with the indications of volcanic activity and must be convinced by Mr. Sand Hog that what has been happening across the city is not actually terrorism. Throw in some incompetent DHS and FBI investigators; an incredulous mayor and his scheming, corrupt deputy; a female Sand Hog whose daddy was a legend among Sand Hogs; a foreman who is overly safety-conscious, except when he\\'s not; and the unfortunate but gruesome deaths of several supporting \"color\" characters and you\\'ve got your standard disaster movie fare, all dressed up with nowhere to go except straight down the tubes.<br /><br />As seems to be the new standard, the volcano is not itself the \"enemy,\" typically the case in classic disaster movies; no, the volcano is the unfortunate result spawned by a greedy (read: evil) scientist of the \"mad\" persuasion who has drilled a 7-mile deep hole beneath Manhattan into the Earth\\'s molten core so as to capture the thermal energy and make bazillions of dollars. Really. Greedy, Evil Scientist guy has been able to pull this off with the help of the Deputy Mayor, who has greased palms all over the city in order to keep the drilling secret until such time as the thermal energy could be captured and the resulting power plant used to \"open franchises\" the world over. Oh, and make Greedy, Evil Scientist guy and Deputy Mayor filthy, stinking rich.<br /><br />Once Mr. Sand Hog has convinced Dr. USGS that there really is a volcano developing beneath Manhattan, it is up to Local 147 to stop it. Of course. With just 5 guys, two of whom die in the process. C\\'mon, you know how this goes: the greedy, evil scientist guy dies, the safety-waffling foreman dies, the homeless guy dies, the black guy dies, the Hispanic pyromaniac dies in a column of lava, the female Sand Hog survives and Mr. Sand Hog and Dr. USGS get back together and suck face as the credits roll.<br /><br />In the 50s and 60s, we were subjected to horror movies populated with monsters created from nuclear testing. In the 70s, disaster movies became an art form, with man struggling - often in futility - against the ravages of nature: no way did George Kennedy try to stop that 1975 earthquake, but he sure managed the aftermath really, really well. We would see disaster as the result of man\\'s folly - think \"The Towering Inferno\" for example - but also as the quirky acts of nature they are. There is no moral imperative in an avalanche: the best one could be accused of is getting what\\'s coming to them for being in the wrong place, against instructions.<br /><br />In these modern disaster movies, we are treated to scenarios in which garden variety pests (bees, bats, locusts and the like) become monsters created out of genetic engineering or toxic waste dumping, or the very planet itself rebels against its victimization at the hands of mankind, specifically, Greedy Evil Scientist guys and their investors. That the Department of Homeland Security plays so prominently in this story is, I think, indicative of the scare level living just below the surface of the American consciousness. Perhaps we can console ourselves with thinking that we can have some control over terrorism when faced with the towering realities of volcanic activity. How much more helpless can a person be than in the face of a volcano? Instead, as the FBI and DHS chase their tails around looking for bogeyman \"terrorists,\" science and tunnel workers overtake and control nature. One wonders if the SciFi Channel folks intended for this to be the moral of the story: terrorists, we can\\'t catch \\'em but, boy howdy, we can put a hurt on a natural disaster! One doubts that such a \"lesson\" is the purpose here, as it seems very little in this TV movie is planned out that well. The clichés are working overtime, the special effects aren\\'t, and you and your sweetie can project the plot line almost to a certainty. There are no surprises in Disaster Zone: Volcano in New York, except perhaps your own surprise at your willingness to waste two hours of your life on such dreck. Not a bad way to snozzle away two hours on a bitterly cold Saturday night, but those are two hours of your life you will never get back. If you must watch this movie, invite some friends over and make it a party.',\n"," 'This is the worst kind of film.<br /><br />The plot is ludicrous, the characters are unrealistic stereotypes who never look like they believe it themselves. Are white people such monsters that they will continue to call two white child rapists in their 20s \"good boys\" and need to be persuaded that this might be grounds for provocation? Are black people universally inspiring? Do the Ku Klux Klan really stand outside court rooms shooting at lawyers with nobody intervening? Do judges really think that a fair trial can be conducted when the jury can hear a mob outside shouting \"Kill him\"? Do black people really stand shoulder to shoulder with the Klan waiting to hear the verdict? Do wives really take several months to realise that their husband might be defending a man from unfair hanging because he knew might have done the same thing? Do juries really acquit people of murder because they feel sorry for them? Do lawyers really use a defense of sanity in order to persuade people that their client was temporarily insane? <br /><br />Worst of all, any high-minded principles of this film were lost to the completely exploitative and gratuitous use of sexual crime to titillate the audience. Was the subject of rape, let alone child gang rape, really in competent hands here? Is it really a subject that belongs in Hollywood hands? And if so, why the completely gratuitous kidnap and stripping of Sandra Bullock? And the completely pointless statutory rape charge against one of the witnesses? Seems like the director didn\\'t feel THAT strongly about sex crime after all.<br /><br />This was taking the excellent plot of To Kill a Mockingbird and making a crass, shallow, tasteless money-spinner from it. Shame on them.',\n"," 'Yes, Christopher Plummer\\'s accent and antics are, to the the least of it, peculiar, but trying to see this as a historically accurate epic seems to be missing the point. The original play was by Peter Shaffer - he of Amadeus and Equus, and this film follows the same themes - the conflict and tension between between (according to interpretation) real and apparent power, or between ability and genius. The tension between Atahualpa and Pisarro is along the same lines as between Mozart and Salieri, or the Boy and the Psychiatrist. One has the trappings of power and success, but who really has the raw power? Seeing it as a historical epic is a mistake - just as \"Becket\" is a very modern take on a different battle of wills.',\n"," 'Uzak (2002), a Turkish film shown in the U.S. as \"Distant,\"<br /><br />was directed, produced, written, and filmed by Nuri Bilge<br /><br />Ceylan.<br /><br />This movie is a gritty and somber version of the clash between a \"city mouse,\" Mahmut, played by Muzaffer Özdemir, and a \"country mouse,\" Yusuf, played by Emin Toprak. <br /><br />Both men are superb actors, and the plot allows them to demonstrate their acting skill. (Tragically, Emin Toprak died in an automobile accident shortly after the movie was completed.)<br /><br />In most country cousin/city cousin tales, the contrast between rural and urban life styles is portrayed in a humorous fashion. In this film, there\\'s little humor or even warmth. Both men<br /><br />have lost touch with human society. Mahmut \\'s work as a<br /><br />commercial photographer for a tile company gives him no satisfaction. He has divorced a woman he clearly<br /><br />still loves, and has no satisfying human relationships.<br /><br />Mahmut has lost his job because of a factory closing in his small town, and doesn\\'t have the skills or the energy to find work in the city. His human interactions are primarily confined to silent observations of the other people who cross his path. He\\'s clearly a warm and caring person, but can\\'t express these qualities in an urban environment.<br /><br />The cousins don\\'t relate well to the world, and they don\\'t relate well to each other. Neither makes an effort to act in a way that would provide an opportunity for bonding or closeness. <br /><br />In a sense, this film portrays an opportunity wasted. <br /><br />Conceivably, each cousin could have provided at least part of what was lacking in the other\\'s life. Instead, they steer parallel unhappy courses. The two men are distant throughout, which is a situation suggested by the film\\'s title.<br /><br />One of my friends mentioned the masterful way in which Ceylan builds detail upon detail. These details ultimately tell us more about the characters than we might have learned by simple exposition.<br /><br />Uzak was shown as part of the Rochester Labor Film series. It\\'s not a \"labor film\" in the traditional sense of that genre. It is a labor film because it demonstrates the harmful effects of unsatisfying work (Mahmut) and unemployment (Yusuf).<br /><br />This is a quiet, absorbing, dark film. Although it doesn\\'t make for happy viewing, I walked out of the<br /><br />theater realizing that I had seen a truly creative and<br /><br />important movie. This film is worth finding and seeing!',\n"," 'This has to be one of those times you come across a movie with a neat cover, my first impression, sweet, full moon, crows, a scarecrow holding a scythe. OK my impression (I had watched scarecrow on TV a weeks ago) perfect, a nice slasher film to start the evening with. ................... wrong, absolutely wrong I think 5 mins in I was gonna take it out, but thought I wasted 3$ on this so Ill finish it wheres the scarecrow, well Im guessing its the legs of the fisher man wearing heavy duty rain boots. you see that every so often. I was watching this thinking.... OK when are those brats gonna run into this dude, at one point I thought they died. but no.... I mean frig, their still alive. I only chuckled at a few parts cause of how badly staged they were. one was the zoom in part at the start. the director/actor/writer says, \"remember I had that feeling, well I have it again\" and it was either a zoom in or zoom out, to hell I\\'m checking back. but I guess the scene was supposedly shocking, I mean whats more shocking is his wife had the same shocked look.... OK... she believed him??? Im sorry but YEAH.... i didn\\'t know he was psychic until I read the movie box to make some sense out of what I witnessed. not only that, they used pictures to make you think this movie is at least clear. <br /><br />the other thing that made me laugh a bit was the, scream in the camera, to make it scary....... OK............... filming a girl close up screaming into the camera for 5 mins.......right..... I laughed cause of how pathetic it was these kids cannot act like the rest of the people in the movie.<br /><br />to top things off the scythe must have got lost or something.... cause seems the bad guy had just a stick. not even an ax, someone should axe the dam production film<br /><br />Don\\'t fall for the picture, this movie is a piece of sh*t. I watched the trailer and guess what it has<br /><br />GIRLS WHERE ARE YOU TALK TO ME and CORN',\n"," 'Before I saw this show, I was completely against anime. That\\'s because most of the stuff that\\'s popular is the wide-eyed mindless \"I fell on you and accidentally touched your boob hehehe\" or \"Haha the stupid chick found porn under his bed\" drama type stuff. However, this was completely different.<br /><br />The greatest thing about Lupin is you get so much Lupin. You get this series, the first and third series if you can get ahold of them, a lot of movies (Though I only like a few), 2 manga series (One hasn\\'t completely been out yet though, and there are others that haven\\'t been released in English) as well as Lupin the first stuff (Novels from Maurice LeBlanc that Lupin III is based on, as well as movies based off those books, most being hard to get ahold of though), some people don\\'t make their Lupin stuff very Lupin-ish though, so even if you don\\'t really like what Lupin is, there still is probably something with the Lupin name you\\'ll like.<br /><br />Lupin III is about the greatest thief in the world and his two friends and partners, as well as a woman who he\\'s gaga for that milks him for all he\\'s worth. However, he also maintains a heart (and no, this isn\\'t one of those drama-ey shows either) and does end up saving lives.<br /><br />His main partner is Daisuke Jigen. He\\'s the gunman. He never misses, and nobody drawns faster then him. He has a strong dislike for women, most likely because the women he falls in love with die or betray him.. Or both.<br /><br />Then there\\'s Goemon Ishikawa The Thirteenth. He\\'s based off a real person of the same name. His sword can cut ANYTHING (except devil\\'s tongue jelly, as I\\'ve heard), literally. The second he pushes up his sword, it\\'s already over. He often complains on having to waste his sword cutting useless things.<br /><br />Then there\\'s Fujiko Mine, who\\'s said to be based off various models from Playboy. She uses her sex appeal to get anything she wants from men, often betraying Lupin in the process. Of course, Lupin always forgives her, because he\\'s crazy for her, but Jigen and Goemon knows she\\'s more trouble then she\\'s worth.<br /><br />Lastly, Koichi Zenigata. Based off Heiji Zenigata, a fictional officer that defeated people just by flinging coins. Although, Zenigata isn\\'t quite as skilled as him. Well, not with Lupin anyway. He\\'s sharp, but often is the comedy relief character when it comes to Lupin. His whole life is chasing Lupin, and if Lupin died, his life would be worthless in his opinion.<br /><br />However, Lupin\\'s not your average thief. He\\'s a gentleman thief. He always leaves notes saying when and what he\\'s going to steal. He does this all with the understanding that he doesn\\'t kill anyone, and the cop who\\'s always after him doesn\\'t kill him either. Lupin is so huge, that many, many, many things have also been made after him, and don\\'t be surprised if you find many references to him in other shows, movies, etc.',\n"," 'This film is enjoyable if you like poverty row, public domain films from the first half of the 20th century, or are a fan of amateur film-making. The film splices together public domain thrillers together along with newly shot scenes in which the \"actors\" (With the sole exception of Redfield doing a near dead on Lugosi rip, all of the \"performers\" are simply dreadful!) attempt to interact with the stock footage. The \"New\" footage is covered with digitally added film scratches, as is some of the already substandard old footage (??!!). As near as I can figure out the plot has something to do with a bunch of strangers being brought together on an island for a will reading(?) This film, while boasting a creative premise ala \\'Dead Men Don\\'t Wear Plaid\\', is a technical and creative wreck. In one dreadfully over long sequence and injured sailor on a ship describes an abortive trip to \\'Fog Island\\', whatever that is! The \"flashback\" then incoherently weaves together old footage from totally different eras, and of totally disparate film quality. Unrelated scenes from \\'The Lost World\\' (1925), The Most Dangerous Game (1932), White Zombie (1932), Bela Lugosi Meets A Brooklyn Gorilla (1952) and some other poverty row productions. This is done over an incredibly bad voice over which seems to have too much room echo as if the audio was recorded on a cheap home video camera.<br /><br />The \"filmmakers\" seem to think that they are paying homage to the great actors of yesteryear by giving characters the surnames of famous actors (Carradine, Zucco, Ouspenskaya, etc..etc..). This tactic was done cleverly, as well as subtly in \\'Final Destination\\' here it\\'s just obnoxious! Bizarre, and painfully unfunny, jokes about Spiderman, Dracula, and Superman abound. Even the old as dirt \\'Dewey, Cheetam and Howe\\' lawyer reference is used here-this was old and tired when The Three Stooges used it in the 1930s.<br /><br />The film stock and audio, don\\'t match scene to scene, and dozens of different sources are used for Lugosi. The finale effect is that he seems to be getting, older, younger, older, thinner, heavier, younger and older again minute by minute. Oddly the film didn\\'t use this as a comedy subplot and squanders a good chance for comedy.<br /><br />Truth be told though, It was great fun to watch this late at night in bed. Maybe thats what they wanted to happen!',\n"," 'Oh dear, this is one of the most worst TV shows I\\'ve ever seen. Actors are suppose to scare innocent victims while being filmed by hidden cameras.

It obvious that they\\'re all acting, and they\\'re not even good at it. It\\'s so pathetic.<br /><br />The only good thing about this show is the host Shannen Doherty, known for her role as Brenda Walsh in \"Beverly Hills 90210\". I do love her.

The way that it is directed through to the way that you really don't quite know what is going on at the end. The portrayal of Marié by Charlotte Rampling is inspiring that such a high level of acting could be protrude on film still. Her performance is one of the best I have ever seen and really drives home the subtle sub plots of what makes her do and think what she dose. The switch between scenes in English and French works well also though some of the subtitles are not so good. This alas is a constant problem. Bruno Cremer's performance is both realistic and spiritual which really drives home his characters role. I was amused to see that François Ozon thinks of Germans in the same light as his countryman Anton De Cones, as a race obsessed with nudity. As the only other occupants of the 'German Beach' were naked.\",\n"," \"Sjöströms masterpiece and a movie that captures the swedish soul .

Don't miss it for the world!\",\n"," \"One of Disney's masterpieces, a true work of art was brought back to life. I loved the loyalty of this sequel, to the original drawings and voices. The characters are endearing and there is added humor in this movie. Thumper's personality has been rounded up more and the beauty and dignity of the forest and the deer in the forest is unspoiled. In my opinion, it is a keeper. The music, though, leaves much to be desired. It would have been more respectful regarding the artistic value of the movie, to have richer music written for it. It was mediocre music and it didn't take away from the movie itself because the animation was so true to the majestic original. I believe that Disney had a keen pedagogic sense. Through his media resources he taught his young audiences (even the young at heart) to appreciate cultural manifestations: Music, a very notorious one. So this is how Disney's aim fails in Bambi II. It doesn't really teach the ear, so to speak, to appreciate the sonic expressions in its music.\",\n"," \"Director Karl Francis once again totally fails to distinguish himself with this clumsily directed drama about McCarthy blacklisted writer-director, Herbert Biberman. Subtle and intelligent performances from Jeff Goldblum and Greta Scacchi are totally wasted in this otherwise uninspiring little film. The cinematography is fine; the editing makes the best of what it has to work with, which is not much. The problem lies entirely with the direction, which fails to pack even the slightest emotional punch, which is quite a feat considering the source material. What's worse is that it is liberally sprinkled with the kind of sickly B-movie idealism that I thought mainstream cinema had grown out of in the mid-seventies. The results come over as amateurish and basically unintelligent, not even worth a straight to video. This movie is a master class in how to ruin a great idea with incompetent direction. Please Mr Francis, just stop making films - nobody is interested.\",\n"," \"This is a mostly forgotten film today, though it deserves to be seen. It bears a lot of similarity to the great All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) in that the film is meant to warn against the horrors of war instead of glamorize it.<br /><br />Frederick March does an excellent job in portraying a troubled WW1 ace. Despite his success, he can't seem to forget that each victory equals him killing another human being. This inner turmoil continues throughout the film and climaxes when he is given yet another accolade.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the film by revealing what happens next. But, it came as a bit of a surprise! The ending clearly makes the movie.<br /><br />By the way, the VCR box cover shows Cary Grant. Yes he was an important supporting actor in this movie, but considering March's performance, it is a darn shame they are trying to capitalize on Grant and not March.<br /><br />PS--if you liked this film, try watching the hard to find ACE OF ACES, starring Richard Dix. It's very similar except that Dix is a pacifist who only reluctantly goes to war. Once he becomes a pilot, unlike March, he finds he LOVES killing and his personality changes dramatically!

They handle about an unpleasant substance, the production values are extremely poor and the videostore lady always looks at you like you\\'re some kind of dangerous psychopath when you rent them. Yet, these Nazi-exploitation movies have an enormous cult-value and they bring intriguing controversy. Well, usually that is, since this \"SS Experiment Love Camp\" is an utterly boring mess! The story is set in a vicious medical camp-base, where the best German soldiers are brought to copulate with resistant enemy women. Supposedly, this serves a higher purpose but they\\'re never actually telling us what that might be. When a stud-soldier unexpectedly falls in love with his mating partner, his body is used for another \\x96 much more vile - medical experiment, namely the world\\'s very first testicle transplant! \"SS Experiment Love Camp\" is an infamous video-nasty and, although it really sounds like one, it\\'s hardly worth calling a shocker. The repulsiveness is limited to a few sequences (a girl gets both boiled an iced in a water tank, another one is hung bleeding by her feet) while the rest is of the film talkative dullness about the superiority of the Third Reich etc etc... The cast of characters features your usual lesbian warden, a perverted elderly guard and a fugitive doctor. The camera-work is weak and the torture devices are pathetic. If you do feel the uncontrollable desire to watch a Nazi exploitation movie, you can never go wrong with \"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\" or Tinto Brass\\' \"Salon Kitty\". Please, do avoid this garbage at all costs.',\n"," \"In the DVD commentary, Pascal Greggory and the director state that this is not a comedy about bisexuality, it is a comedy about sexuality and choices. This is so true. Alain faces the choices we all face. Does he choose the person who is more like a partner than a romance? Does he choose the younger, eager lover who offers little more than sex? Does he choose to pursue the yet-to-be-obtained intriguing person he has recently met? A few other peripheral choices also hover nearby. But even more basic questions are asked: Does he have to choose? Can he choose more than one option? Will any choice make him completely happy if it cancels out all the others? This film made me reflect on these questions and choices in my own life, which is exactly what a good film should do. I think anyone who is over 30 and unmarried should be able to relate to Alain, at least on this level. <br /><br />A few reviewers have asked why so many characters are attracted to the narcissistic, emotionally remote Alain, but in my experience, it is often just this type of person who has many people attracted to him. For some, he is a challenge. For others, he is safely unattainable. For yet others, he is someone who will hurt them (which they expect), or who won't be hurt too much if they leave him. Alain mirrors the other characters' loneliness back to them, and one wonders if any of them would be happy if they ended up being Alain's choice \\x96 and if he could ever stick with that choice. <br /><br />If you're happily content in a stable, long-lasting relationship, then you will see this film as a comedy about things that happen to other people. But if your heart still has the capacity to lead you in directions you don't expect, this film will have greater meaning for you.\",\n"," 'People may say I am harsh but I can\\'t help it. The movie is so bad I was absolutely stunned. The first movie was bad enough if you ask me. It was greatly exaggerated and silly but this one, despite the creepy scenes, has a seriously ass-stupid story. They actually went deep into investigating Kayako\\'s past and found out that she had a mother (Who miraculously speaks English) who was an exorcist and \"fed\" evil spirits to her daughter. Stupid? Yeap. OK, it started out with Kayako who was an ordinary housewife who had an affair with some bloke and got herself dead. This part is still OK. Because of this moment of rage, she became a vengeful spirit who kills anyone who enters her house. Acceotable. Now, her killings began to stretch a little where she actually had the opportunity to travel throughout Tokyo just to finish her victims. (Her victims were travelling, weren\\'t they?) This struck me hard. Now if a ghost could actually do such a thing like travelling throughout a country without paying public transport fares, I wouldn\\'t mind being. Ask someone to come kill me then *snorts*. And to crown things all up, the ghost who was once depicted as a very vengeful one (In Ju-on: The Grudge, which was way better than this trash) is now depicted as some spectre who truly enjoys herself and felt that it is her mission to finish of people. Things became worse (For me, the viewer) when the ghost became coming in forms of large strands of hair. I mean, ??? If a ghost had such power, I seriously dun mind being one. I never really liked movies depicting ghosts as MONSTERS cause they\\'re not. The overall results is just plain bad. Like The Grudge 2.

However, they did a hideous job of it. The acting was horrible, and unless one is familiar with the Bible in some fashion, one COULD NOT have understood what the movie was trying to get across. Not only was the movie terribly made, but the people who made it even had some facts wrong. However, in this \"critique\", those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into.

There are some good numbers in here, not the best of any musical but they are melodic and good to listen to. One thing I didn't like was Gene Kelly's character. He should have supported his girlfriend! But anyway, that's perhaps the only criticism I have about this movie. Cover Girl is a glorious, fluffy film - perfect escapism. Not everyone's ideal movie, but a wonderful movie nonetheless, due to Rita Hayworth's star power. Great movie, truly impressed.\",\n"," 'I am not understanding why people are praising this movie. I didn\\'t like it at all. I watch it with several people. None of them cared for it either. First of all. It is just plain that another low budget studio is trying to cash in on a big name story.

While watching some in house entertainment at a casino Claire is hypnotised by an English clairvoyant named Cecil Howard. Claire suffers a vivid hallucination about a sadistic SS officer named Olivier (Robert Bristol) in a Nazi concentration camp. After the show Claire talks with Howard and invites him to supper. Soon after she leaves Howard is killed by what appears to be a red light (don't ask). Meanwhile a old Jewish man named Abraham Weiss (Marc Lawrence) who is a Nazi hunter spots Olivier on a T.V. programme and recognises him as the man he has been after for years. Weiss immediately tells his story to bitter, overworked police officer Lieutenant Sterne (Cameron Mitchell) who lives just across the hall from him. Sterne agrees to look into Weiss's claims but eventually admits there is nothing he can do, especially after Weiss gives him some newspaper cuttings from 1944 which appear to show Olivier but since the paper is over 30 years old and Olivier would now be in his 60' or 70's and the guy on T.V. is still in his 20's & therefore Weiss's story is psychically impossible. That night Weiss is found dead in a parking lot. Lt. Sterne decides to take a personal interest and investigate even further. Claire is starting to lose her mind. Her husband James is about to publish a book called 'God is dead' in which James claims God does not and never has existed. Claire as a stout Catholic is deeply against the book and tries to convince James not to publish it. Olivier, who runs a cult of Satan worshippers, feels James would be a good person to have on board and attempts to convince James to join him and his organisation.

Tallas as Greg Tallas. I am not sure if this information is correct but I don't think I've ever heard of a film directed by three different people and maybe that's why it turned out to be a bit of a jumbled up mess. The script by Philip Yordan tries something different and for that it should get at least an extra point. Even though at the end of the day it's still a mess with the story all over the place. Things just happen for little reason, characters aren't that likable and the dialogue in certain scenes isn't up to much. The story becomes occasionally confusing and unfocused. The script comes across as heavy handed at times with it's religious overtones and story arc. Almost as if Yordan wanted to make a thought provoking horror film with a message, obviously it fails, badly. Cataclysm starts out very interesting and draws the viewer in by not revealing too much, too soon. Unfortunately this decision to try and make the plot more mysterious back fires during the middle third as it gets somewhat boring waiting for something to happen but then things explode into a gore drenched finale. The acting is OK for this type of low budget nonsense, except Cift who seems to speak her lines really slowly compared to everyone else. And it's always nice to see genre veteran Cameron Mitchell. Some characters appear dubbed throughout. There is very little, in fact none, blood or gore in the film until the last 10 minutes or so when the red stuff is splashed everywhere. In this sequence there is some real surgery footage in a blood soaked over the top climax to round the film off. I think the film itself was shot on location rather than studio's and has a generally good feel throughout, the production values were much better than I expected. While not brilliant by any stretch of the imagination the photography, editing, special effects, continuity and music are all reasonable enough and I've sat through a lot worse. I'm sure a lot of people will automatically call this film crap as it's an easy target but for those of us who like this sort of off-beat grade-z low budget horror film from days gone by than this one may interest you and is probably worth tracking down. Just because it dares to try something a little different if for no other reason, it doesn't always succeed but at least those involved tried. Overall I'm glad I watched it, certainly not the best film in the world but then did anyone really expect it to be?\",\n"," \"The first review I saw on this site about this movie was someone calling it a masterpiece. This movie is as much a masterpiece as Friday the 13th IV isn't a masturbation piece. And that doesn't even make sense. But neither does this movie.<br /><br />Spoilers- I could sum up this movie by saying it's about a fruity looking Swedish kid who moves into a house with his parents and eventually watches them get murdered in the basement by some 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm. However, I'll add a little more.....<br /><br />First of all this movie is crazy boring. Secondly, it involves some 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm. Now those two sentences shouldn't be referring to the same movie, but in this case they are.<br /><br />From what I can piece together the family moves into this house out in the countryside so the dad can research the death of a colleague who also lived in the same house. The colleague basically hung himself as a result of living in a house haunted by an 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm. Like in many haunting movies the colleague dude conveniently left a cassette tape explaining just enough about the bad stuff going on in the house to make the viewer decide not to turn off the movie yet. As you continue to let the movie play you'll quickly realize you made a mistake.<br /><br />So the family moves to the house and the Swedish boy starts seeing some 1800's-ish looking girl, but it's hard to tell since this movie was made in the 70's. Her clothing may have been normal small town 70's gear rather than 1800's gear. Also some googly eyed babysitter chick shows up and generally acts strange, but never does anything and is eventually killed. Which doesn't make a lot of sense because there's a scene where an 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm (yes THE 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm) kills some broad in the house and the babysitter cleans up the blood the next day to hide it. So if she's helping this basement monster out why does he later trap her in his basement and kill her? Maybe she didn't do a good enough job of cleaning up the blood and she was already on thin ice with him to begin with.<br /><br />General strange noises and what not happen in the house and at some point there is the discovery of a grave in the living room, which is obviously where this 1800's doctor is buried. Or is he buried? Well he might be. Whether or not he's the guy in the basement with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm is up to speculation, but it is mentioned in the movie that the doctor performed devious experiments when he was alive. So the doctor either created this basement monster or he IS him. Either way, the movie is so boring you won't care. All you'll care about is why this guy in the basement is 99% monster except for his one normal arm.<br /><br />In summary you could say this movie is about a family being haunted and eventually killed by an 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm or you could say it's about a family being haunted and killed by an 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one human arm. But no matter how you look at it, they all die and you'll also die a little inside when you go to google this house so you can stay there for a night and make your own bootleg ghosthunters TV show and try to sell it to the travel channel only to find out that you can't even find this house because nobody cared enough to put it's real location anywhere on the internet.\",\n"," \"Crossword puzzles, and the many people who make them popular, are the focus in Wordplay, including the editor of the NY Times puzzle (the most notorious of them in the USA), celebrities and politicians, and the general public obsessed with them. As a documentary Wordplay is good, not great, film-making about its subject with a couple of montages and interlocking scenes that are weak. But the subject matter, and usually how its presented, sparks a fine interest even in a non-crossword puzzle player like myself. As words are all that we have to work with in communication and just everyday discourse, it's also attached here to the idea of testing, of competition, and how different and varying crosswords can get. Like the documentary Spellbound from a few years back, the director is also after the kind of irony of making such an isolated experience of finishing a puzzle into an event with hundreds of players once a year with friendships and acquaintances- a social event as much as a match-up.<br /><br />Many parts are amusing as well; we get interviews from Jon Stewart, Bill Clinton, Bob Dole, and the editor of NY Times Crossword himself, Will Shortz, and they all give some insightful, funny little bits of interest into making the puzzles and playing them. But for the most part we're into the mind-set of several key players, real people whom will all come together for the tournament in Jaunary. What makes all of this work, and what actually makes crossword puzzles become good enough for cinema, is watching smart people, un-cluttered for the most part with problems, who can focus all of their attentions on this one activity, to the point of obsessive compulsive behavior. It's really fun, in a nerdy way, trying to guess some of these words (or rather watching them guessing the words) along with the players. And the way the puzzles are created sparks a little interest too, as it's one of those parts of life I myself could never, ever accomplish. Worth a look, though probably more so for fans of the activity.\",\n"," \"This ranks as one of the few documentaries, along with Littlest Soldier, where his politics and German Guilt are most direct. Usually he limits himself to studies of character, individuals. This one is about the character of modern warfare and brings up memories of The Doors' When the Music's Over, and reference to Apocalypse Now. Herzog flies in a helicopter, through oil fires, playing Wagner, and reading from the Apocalypse. This is a filmaker's documentary of life imitating art imitating life. Even if you don't think real images of scenes usually reserved for horror movies are moving, the photography of the colors of the sun through the smoke and fire is stunning. And those who think it's politics are one sided should note the equally graphic details of the results of both sides' work. For those that don't remember, there was a little action in the Persian Gulf in 1991.\",\n"," 'What we have here is a downright brilliant piece of early 80\\'s incompetence that will render even the biggest connoisseur of trash- cinema completely speechless! \"Wizards of the Lost Kingdom\" is a very cheap and cheesy fantasy/Sword-and-Sorcery adventure that doesn\\'t have an actual plot but does eagerly & shamelessly borrows elements from other films. Writer Ed Naha and Hector Olivera (who?) watched enough similar type of movies to know that they needed a handful of essential characters, but probably figured that all the rest would follow automatically. In order to make a fantasy-adventure you need: one super- evil villain (preferably with a black cape), one young hero in training, one lone warrior, one amiable type of furry pet, one wise midget living in the woods (optional) and a whole colorful collection of hideous demons, enslaved dwarfs, and winged gargoyles to serve as filler. The story is phenomenal and so original, with Simon the young son of a wizard having to flee from his beloved kingdom after the evil magician Shurka takes over the power and killed the king. Simon wants to go back and save the people, but therefore he needs his powerful ring which he lost during his escape. Simon befriends lone warrior Kor (the usually cool dude Bo Svenson who clearly needed the pay check), who assists Simon during the long and devastating journey full of ordeals, dangerous encounters and magical showdowns. Admittedly it doesn\\'t even sound too bad thus far, but that\\'s merely just because I excluded all the deliciously inept little details. Simon has a best friend named Gulfax, for example. Gulfax is an albino version of Chewbacca and evokes incontrollable chuckles whenever he opens his poodle-snout to yelp something incomprehensible. The obstacles during journey back home are hilariously irrelevant to the \"plot\" and simply serve as padding footage to cover up the lack of actual content. Simon has nightmarish visions inside the tent of a suspicious forest nymph, Kor settles an old score with the pig-faced nemesis whose sister he refused to marry and there\\'s the supposedly horrible \\'suicide cave\\' where you can only sing your way out of. But the absolute most unequally brilliant sequence \\x96 not just of this film alone but in the history of cinema \\x96 involves the resurrection of four zombie warriors. Simon awakes the legendary courageous warriors, hoping they will assist them in their battle, but the rotting corpses only take a few steps, complain about how tired they are and return back to their graves. That\\'s it! So much for the zombie sub plot! Best sequence ever! I could go on listing unintentionally hilarious little details for several more paragraphs, but you get the idea. \"Wizards of the Lost Kingdom\" is a tremendously messed-up \"so-bad-it\\'s-good\" film.

If you are looking for one of those awful movies that are so horrible that they are actually good, then this may be for you. There are so many unintentional laughs in this film, that it could almost be considered a comedy. Let\\'s start with the opening titles, that say \"Jack-O\", and then add the word \"Lantern\", as if the viewer wasn\\'t able to figure out the movie was about a pumpkin by the giant pumpkin shown on both the cover and in the opening scene of the movie. After that, the movie goes in about 20 different directions, none of which make much sense. Jack-o is everywhere, he\\'s in people\\'s houses, in the woods, and yet he doesn\\'t ever seem to do much of anything. He does make a few kills, but the long buildup to those killings is so poorly acted and constructed you almost wish Jack-o would take out his rage on you the viewer.

The boy who is the lead in the film (the director\\'s son) has about as much emotion as a corpse, and just about all of the other actors/actresses are just as bad for numerous reasons (especially the bug-eyed lady with eyes bigger than saucers). But, having said all this, if you take this for what it is, (that is a steaming pile of dung) then you will get a few laughs from this movie. What I also found amusing is that the makers of the DVD saw fit to release a \"10th Anniversary Version\" of this movie (as if the original wasn\\'t good enough). And someone actually had the idea of making a \"behind the scenes\" mini film which is also included in the 10th anniversary edition (I\\'m not sure why).......I\\'ll give this 3 smashed pumpkins out of 10...',\n"," 'I love movies that push it and show the dark side and psychology in human interaction without sugarcoating it.

She is pregnant with her second child which she got from her own father who repeatedly raped her. Her mother is abusive, keeps depriving her of self worth and makes her eat.

Her mother seems to sexually abuse her too, she treats her first child like an animal because the girl has down syndrome. It goes on like that, spices everything up with her father dying and her finding out he was HIV positive right when she is trying to turn her life around with her second child and her learning progressing in a new school.

And I think Pierce Brosnan did a good job. What I had trouble with was the fact that in the courtroom scene, Brosnan notices the criminal make eye contact with a suspicious-looking man, who then gets up and leaves. Brosnan figures out that there is a bomb in the courtroom and gets everyone out (well, almost everyone) - and he's figured this out by the look exchanged by those two men. He got a very good look at the other guy. Yet, they never follow up on that lead. It's a courtroom in D.C. Surely there is surveillance footage they could be going through to identify this man. They never do that. They forget about him entirely. In fact, Brosnan never mentions this guy to anyone. Also, when they figure out that the terrorists will next target Ron Silver (because of a certain bill that he sponsored), Brosnan goes over to his house - but instead of questioning Silver about who might be against this bill, who might want him dead, he just yells at him to stay away from his wife. And then later when they figure out that what the bomb is, and how it's detonated, they also figure out a very easy way to defuse it. I won't give it away here. But suffice it to say that in later scenes with a bomb, they never bother to try this method of defusing it. It's sloppy writing.

I think Reese Witherspoon was a great actress even in this film, her debut, and this is definitely worth watching!

Several of the unscrupulous bounty hunters actually stab Dillon who is found and taken back to Dodge where he awakens to find Miss Kitty. Matt tries to help protect Flagg meanwhile Mannon returns to Dodge where he torments Miss Kitty as he did in the original episode. Back then he had raped Kitty and beat her, something Matt did not know.<br /><br />Okay, inconsistencies. First, but this is my opinion, Matt would not have become a Mountain Man. It\\'s just not him(maybe they got him confused with his Zeb Macahan character from How the West Was Won). Second, Kitty explains why she left Dodge. It\\'s a flashback from the episode \"The Badge\" where Matt is shot and Kitty just can\\'t handle seeing him hurt anymore. Any fan of the show would know that this episode(don\\'t know when it aired but certainly not in the last year of the show) ends with Matt meeting Kitty and sort of convincing her to come back, which she does. The movie made it sound like she never came back. Amanda Blake left the show in 1974. There are reports she claims she was sick and tired of the character and the commute(she was living in AZ at the time). Others question that producer John Mantley fired her for money reasons. They allegedly did not get along at all. Third, in the episode Mannon, he is apparently shot dead from how the episode ends but I guess it could have been interpreted as him possibly surviving.<br /><br />Those are disappointments show-wise. Other ones that made fans cringe are James Arnesses\\' hair and make-up, absolutely scary. Kitty looked her age and did not look bad at all. Amanda Blake had contracted AIDS and she later died from the disease 2 years after this film. Ken Curtis did not return, he reportedly wanted more money than Blake. Finally, Matt and Kitty never kiss at the end, they never even get together. She see\\'s him through a window and sheds a tear as he goes back to his lonely life. Reportedly, the original script had Matt walk into the hotel where Kitty was(and you could use your imagination). There were too many Flashbacks which took away from developing the plot to this movie. They actually show one Flashback twice.<br /><br />John Mantley produced the movie and I was surprised someone with such a grasp on GS let this be the end product.<br /><br />Also, the cover art for the movie on this website only show\\'s James Arness. There is another version which has a small picture of Kitty on it.<br /><br />Otherwise, it\\'s fun to see M&K back together.',\n"," 'I Love this movie! I know some people might say that it was not a great movie, but I really disagree. The comedy is classic Mel Brooks style and the actors were superbly chosen. This was my first exposure to Cary Elwes, and Dave Chappelle and what a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood mind you. He has great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. Dave Chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as Achoo. The characters were all very well planned out and all added their own little quirks to the movie. I highly recommend that you rent this movie and enjoy it with a nice bowl of popcorn and some close friends!',\n"," 'Sure, there\\'s stuff here that the Coens and Elmore Leonard have done before, but so what?

Actually, I know that a few people will feel that way -- I've shown it to several friends, and they all agree it looks beautiful and manages to amuse on numerous occasions. But they don't get much more out of it. That's too bad for them. Aaaw yeah.<br /><br />As Vincent Canby said in his review, from 1970 in the New York Times, 'Fellini Satyricon is its own justification'. This movie exists purely to engage on an aesthetic level. The surrealism, the carnival-of-life atmosphere, the monumental pageantry, the visual juxtaposition of beauty and ugliness, and the black humour are all the film possesses and are all it requires. I believe that Fellini's intention with this film was simply to entertain. And he was a master entertainer, no doubt.<br /><br />Don't expect much in the way of characterisation, of complex plot developments, or of nifty moral expression. This is a film that looks and sounds beautiful, and it manages to hold your interest (or mine anyway, I can't speak for everyone) for two brief hours by doing just that. Fellini = Godlike genius.\",\n"," 'I\\'m shocked that all the \"hated it\" ratings are sixes and sevens, still above average. To me, this seems a case of \"the emperor has no clothes\". I understand this film was produced on a very low budget in the early 70\\'s...Regardless, it became a struggle to sit through and watch. The DVD I saw did have some subtitles, but about 75% of the speech is not subtitled. Some of it is hard to understand. The Jamaican patois was cool to hear, but you struggle not to \\'tune out\\' after awhile. Some of the shots were nice, and the realism was there, even if some of the performances were not great.(Jimmy Cliff did a good job) The plot is not bad, but quite predictable. In the 1:43 film, the highlights are Jimmy Cliff(Ivan) singing for a scene, and a couple of shoot-outs and a fight. Probably 15 minutes or so. The rest is pretty boring. BTW, near the beginning of the film, there are some weird cuts with the Ivan character that seem like a editing mistake, which made me laugh for a bit. One reviewer said this film has been cut so many times, that there are few copies of the original 1972 theatrical version out there. The ending was kind of interesting, showing how the media from a young age influences people, it could also be a general comment on the white man\\'s/colonialism\\'s influence on Jamaica. Other main themes are poverty, corruption, church, ambition... In closing, the soundtrack is definitely worthwhile, the film much less.',\n"," \"Rififi is a great film that is overlooked. It's a crime drama where a man gets out of jail and plans another job. It's an over used story but this one is different from the others. They round up the usual suspects for the job. This film takes a look at how the family gets torn apart as time goes on. The actual heist scene is one of the best I have ever seen. Instead of a suspenseful soundtrack the director decided to go with silence, around thirty minutes of silence. This fits the mood perfectly and is often copied these days. Of course things get out of hand and people die and it ends in a great ending that builds up in suspense.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a great film noir that not a lot of people talk about this is a great pick up.\",\n"," 'How much of the average American population would be entertained by watching two dull, lifeless middle-aged men play a chess game for 2 hours and 18 minutes? I can pretty much assure that number is pretty small. I personally love to play chess, but if you were to force me to sit and watch people do it, I\\'d feel like committing suicide after the first thirty minutes. That\\'s about how I felt watching Sleuth. The entire movie is absolutely nothing but two men playing a dull game from the opening to the closing. There camera never leaves the house for the entire runtime. The most diversity in the entire movie is some minor clothing changes and some facial expressions. The entire movie is straight-up dialogue and nothing else. The entire movie is two long, dull scenes, with one scene change near the middle. If you have less of an attention span than the average person with Down syndrome, you\\'ll be bored to the point of nausea long before the 30-minute mark. There is about as much entertainment value in Sleuth as there is in watching a tree stump rot, and that may even be an overstatement, because at least doing that you can use your own imagination. Here, the most imagination you get is two men, four walls, and an insane amount of bland conversation. If that describes what you consider an entertaining movie, Sleuth will keep you on the edge of your seat for sure.<br /><br />People would argue that the conversation scenes I reference carry the \"clever plotting\". In other words, the conversation scenes carry a cute, predictably plot-twisted story revolving around all the clichés that we\\'ve seen since the camera was invented. There is nothing clever about the plot. Sure it has a couple twists that will make you shed an \"Awe, that was cute!\" smile, but they\\'re the same plot twists you\\'ve seen countless times. This is a clichéd murder story, folks. It\\'s not some hyper-original idea. If you saw a single Sherlock Holmes episode as a kid, you\\'ve seen everything this movie has to offer. If the plot were truly clever or creative, it would do something new or different.<br /><br />The other problem with the plot\\x97if you even call it a plot; I don\\'t\\x97is that it\\'s so predictable. No, you may not have any lead-ons as to who-killed-who or who\\'s-dead-who\\'s-not, but does it really matter? The outcome is always the same. You\\'re always told the answer, and there\\'s always only two options. It\\'s the most basic immature plot line known to man. I\\'ve seen cartoons that put this plot to thumb-sucking shame. Who really cares anymore? I overuse the metaphor in my reviews, but a movie this unoriginal is like a joke you heard in kindergarten and then someone tries to make you laugh at that joke when you\\'re 80-years-old. It\\'s ineffective. It\\'s pointless. Even if you force a laugh, you still feel annoyed.<br /><br />I understand this movie was made in the 70s. People will defend it by saying, \"There was nothing like it when it came out!\" and they\\'re dead wrong. All their doing is defending their deep sense of nostalgia. In reality, this movie was just as unoriginal in 1972 as it is in 2009. And do you know what\\'s sadder? Movies just like it are still being made, and they\\'re still getting acclaim. It makes me sick. We don\\'t need another paper-thing whodunit murder mystery with the same predictable results. What the mystery genre needs is maturity. Instead of pumping out more kindergarten level plot line movies like this, why not actually think of an, you know, actual STORY to support the mystery. That\\'s something directors/writers obviously didn\\'t get back in the 70s, and it\\'s something they still don\\'t get today. Instead of focusing on plots, why not focus on STORY? Overall, Sleuth is a complete waste of time. It has a couple of intelligent high-brow lines, but I could get those from my dying grandfather. Why do I have to watch a pointless movie to hear them? And, similarly, I could get the same predictable level of mystery of watching this movie from playing the Clue board game\\x97alone. Why do I have to watch a pointless movie to do so? The more I think about it, I cannot find a single redeeming value in Sleuth whatsoever. It\\'s long, boring, dull, pointless, lame, slow, uninteresting, paper-thin, predictable, annoying, pathetic . . .<br /><br />And most of all, Sleuth is exactly the same story you\\'ve seen hundreds of times, yet it expects you to be enthralled. Now THAT is a clever joke.<br /><br />0/10',\n"," 'There were some great moments of reality in there depicting modern day life (not only in Japan, but everywhere).

And the agents clearly couldn\\'t just ignore it all, they would have to look into it at some point, and the episode ends so early that we don\\'t get to see what they find out. I get the sense that they might have run out of time while making this episode and had to cut things out, since a lot of plot threads are abandoned. And aside from this episode, the X-Files normally seems to cater to the curious type of audience that wants to actually find out what\\'s going on. It is an investigation show after all. I wish this was a \"to be continued\" episode, because as much as I hate those, this is an interesting story and they could have gone a lot deeper into it.',\n"," 'Intense episode in which a shuttle craft mission lead by Spock crash lands on a most unpleasant world. Indeed, the dangers posed by it\\'s hostile environment leads to a hostile crew as Spock finds his leadership abilities called into question. Hal and Bog in their reviews have already done a fine job of exploring how the Vulcan\\'s logical approach to the crisis proves ineffective in dealing with the stressed-out humans under his command. The only thing to add might be that Spock, at times, displays an almost human surliness that seems very un-Vulcan. But, since this was a first season episode, it may have been filmed before Leonard Nimoy had fully come to understand his character and the proper way to play him, (for example, he was still speaking with that put-on British accent like when he pronounces the word command as \"commond\"). Clearly, this is not the more controlled Mr. Spock we would see in later episodes like \"The Doomsday Machine\", but it\\'s still a good performance and the script provides an interesting set of problems to watch the usually unflappable character try and overcome.<br /><br />As if crash landing wasn\\'t bad enough, the primates that live on the planet were a neat addition to further complicate Spock\\'s bad day. Glimpsed more than they are seen (and a wise move, too as the only creature shown up close looks like it\\'s wearing a fur dress), these hairy monsters prowl about in the fog making hissing noises and echoing roars. They attack with huge spears, and in one scene maul a comparatively puny human to death. Thoroughly nasty, their presence in the story leads to a neat scene on the Enterprise bridge as Kirk hears the report of returning search party leader. Appearing on a viewer screen bruised and bedraggled in a torn-up uniform, Lt. Commander Kelowitz relates how his team was attacked by \"creatures similar to ones discovered on Hanson\\'s Planet, only much, much bigger. Ten- maybe twelve feet in height.\" Clearly exhausted and maybe a touch traumatized, Kelowitz cautions Kirk that if the missing shuttle craft crew are on that planet...well, he doesn\\'t have to finish the sentence for Kirk to get his meaning. It\\'s an effective little touch that casts a shadow of dread on the possible fate of Kirk\\'s missing crew members. In fact they should have used this seldom seen character of Kelowitz more often as he would have made a great running feature. Like Scotty\\'s dire warnings about the condition of the ship\\'s engines, or those red shirted security men who were always first to bite the dust, you\\'d know the situation was dire if Kelowitz showed up with a new batch of bruises and another alarming report for Kirk.',\n"," 'Watching Stranger Than Fiction director Marc Forster\\'s The Kite Runner is the cinematic equivalent of eating your vegetables because this art-house epic rated PG-13 is good for your movie-going diet. No, this isn\\'t the kind of movie that I like to slouch on the couch and eyeball at the end of a tough day. The Kite Runner isn\\'t your typical mainstream movie designed to entertain you and make you forget about your troubles. First, no celebrity stars appear in it. Second, nothing is cut and dried, black or white, or so outlandish that you don\\'t believe an image that you see. Third, The Kite Runner lapses into subtitles when the characters occasionally speak in their native tongue. Fourth, Forster\\'s film isn\\'t a romantic trifle about boy-wants-girl, boy-loses-girl, and then boy-wins-girl back. Fifth, this foreign language film may make you feel uncomfortable and challenge your assumptions about life, friendship, and survival. The chief themes here are cowardice and redemption. The protagonist commits a cowardly offense in the first half of the action that he must atone for at the cost of his own personal safety and integrity. Right, The Kite Runner is about redeeming oneself for the sins of the past. We\\'re talking about personal accountability, so don\\'t rent or buy this wonderful movie for a boy\\'s night out celebration or something to take the bad taste of the day out of your system. Based on Khaled Hosseini\\'s bestselling novel, this culturally enlightened melodrama about right and down initially looks like one of those light-hearted friendship movies about adolescents in the vein of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Sandlot. About a half-hour into its 127 minutes, this escapade about two youngsters who fly kites in Afghanistan turns dark and unsavory. Nevertheless, if you can handle the remaining hour of the plot, you\\'ll emerge gratified, relieved, and perhaps even entertained. <br /><br />The Kite Runner opens in San Francisco in the year 2000 as our protagonist, Afghan émigré Amir Jan (Khalid Abdalla of United 93) and his wife Soraya (Atossa Leoni of The Florist) receive two boxes of published copies of Amir\\'s first novel. No sooner has Amir had a chance to bask in his triumph of a life-time as a storyteller than the phone jars him from his reverie and he is drawn reluctantly back into a past that is best left forgotten for him. Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub of The Nativity Story) calls Amir from Pakistan to make a request. Rahim was a servant in Amir\\'s household back in the 1970s when Amir lived with his wealthy Pashtun merchant father Baba (Homayoun Ershadi of A Taste of Cherry) in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion. \"You have one more chance to be good,\" Rahim informs Amir without sugar coating his request. Basically, Rahim wants Amir to fly to Pakistan and then enter war-torn Afghanistan and rescue Rahim\\'s young grandson Sohrab (Ali Danish Bakhty Ari) who is being held a prisoner against his will as a sex slave for Assef (newcomer Abdul Salam Yusoufzai) a cruel Taliban chieftain and Amir\\'s once dreaded adversary. <br /><br />The Kite Runner shifts from San Francisco in 2000 to an extended flashback set in Kabul in 1978 when life was idyllic. Twelve-year-old Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi) and the son of his father\\'s servant, Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada) love to watch movies, such as John Sturges\\' western The Magnificent Seven, when they aren\\'t flying kites. Incidentally, this is kite flying like you\\'ve never seen kite flying. Not only do the kids fly them, but they also compete with other kids to see who can cut the strings of another kid\\'s kite. The kite fighting flight scenes generate the same kind of excitement that the dog fighting scenes had in Tony Scott\\'s Top Gun. Hassan is Amir\\'s best friend but unlike Amir, Hassan belongs to the reviled Hazara minority. Earlier, young Amir and Hassan had a confrontation with young Assef (Elham Ehsas) and his two flunkies. Assef was about to beat them up, but Hassan pulls out his slingshot and threatened to use it on Assef. Assef had no choice but to back down. Meanwhile, Amir was prepared to suffer the hand fate had dealt him. Amir\\'s father Baba laments his son\\'s lack of spine and fears that he will grow up half of a man because he is a coward, unlike the plucky little Hassan who bails Amir out of predicaments. Anyway, Amir and Hassan emerge from the showdown with Assef without a scratch. Later, after Amir sets a new record with his kite flying and fight skills, Hassan runs after a kite to claim it. Hassan is the eponymous character referred to in the title. Hassan claims the fallen kite but he finds himself at the mercy of Assef and his two minions. Assef lets Hassan kept the kite, but his minions pin Hassan spread-eagle, belly down in an alley while Assef sodomizes the youth. Worst, a traumatized Amir watches the assault from nearby but lacks the courage to intervene on behalf of his friend who would have intervened for him.<br /><br />Aside from the extraordinary aerial scenes with the kites, The Kite Runner is down-to-earth, straight-forward stuff. When Amir returns to Afghanistan to rescue Sohrab, he masquerades as a Taliban fighter but he doesn\\'t carry a firearm. The rescue scene in The Kite Runner is rather like the escape scene from The Midnight Express. While Forster doesn\\'t explore the local politics or plunge us into the ethnic and cultural issues at stake here. Indeed, Troy scenarist David Benioff had to eliminate some parts of the book and the racial and ethnic prejudices aren\\'t clearly delineated so you have to accept some things on faith. Forster lensed the film in nearly China to give it an authentic look. Forster deserves credit for making this two hour plus epic fascinating. The performances, especially by the children, stand out for their believability. The Kite Runner is a film that you won\\'t easily forget.',\n"," \"Not a very good movie.<br /><br />Van Wilder 2:The Rise of Taj is a movie that almost completely relies on gross out laughs and unfortunately doesn't succeed.<br /><br />There are a only 2 or 3 giggle moments.<br /><br />Some people might be tricked into watching because its called Van Wilder.

I didn't even know Lauren Cohen was in this(i know her from supernatural)but it was a nice surprise.<br /><br />This is not a very funny movie and at most times just plain stupid.

They should have only called it 'The Rise of Taj'.<br /><br />3/10\",\n"," 'Over the GW is a near failure of a debut feature, and not because it\\'s not without trying...Actually, it is. It\\'s a shamble all the more because it\\'s writer/director/technical everyman Nick Gaglia went through the same rehab cult that he depicts in the film. Sometimes a first time filmmaker, full of the vigor that comes with getting a thumbs up or two from fellow film students, goes headlong into style that is way too disjointed, unsure, and dramatically frustrating that the personal side of the story, the extremely personal side, gets smudged in the purpose of telling a good story. Gaglia, who was 13 when put into a horrid program that basically tortured and brainwashed their \"patients\" with crazy group scare tactics, psychological mind-f*** sessions that could go on for days, and attitudes from the rehab leaders that would make most Nazis cringe, escaped finally when he was 15. I\\'m glad he got out, though it might help if he now goes into a real rehab for his film-making skills, if only for a couple of days, to learn things like, say, structure, proper lighting, fluid camera movement, subtlety with actors, and other basics that are perpetually lost here.<br /><br />It\\'s all the more frustrating because Gaglia is dealing with a subject that should be shown more to the public (there was recently a Newsweek article referring to a similar AA cult-rehab). Many times one wonders if certain personal character studies might work better as documentaries as opposed to narrative dramas. This is an ever-nagging sensation throughout Over the GW, where it almost feels like Gaglia wants to tell the truth but doesn\\'t know how to communicate it properly through his characters. The character that one would think is closest to him, Bronx teen Tony Serra (Gallagher), who is taken by his mother to a rehab in New Jersey, would be closest to Gaglia, is actually much more of a one-dimensional being, where there is very little back-story (we see a brief freak-out, in black and white, in his old home) and little connection to his mother (Moriarty), who has more potential that is never tapped aside from a cold stone who passes her kids off to another. But there is a story to go with his two-year crisis, I guess.<br /><br />Right off the bat things get rough (a nude cavity search in the first five minutes), and soon it\\'s clear that instead of medical care it\\'s more like a cross between anger management and some bizarre religious sect, where the head doctor Hiller (Insinnia) is a total over-controlling loon. But soon Tony\\'s sister Sofia (Donohue) gets thrown in to the program, and as opposed to Tony\\'s repeated moments of outrage and supposed non-compliance, she goes head-on through the whacked-out three step program and once released becoming a runaway. At times there are bits in this fractured nightmare, where there\\'s one woman, a 22 year old mother who has been in the program a year and a half finds she\\'s become a prisoner not allowed to leave, and when the father of the main siblings comes and pays an enraged visit to Hiller when Sofia finally returns to them, that do contain some raw power, very brief glimpses of Gaglia being able to at least garner some leverage in pure melodrama.<br /><br />But these are moments few and far between. It\\'s not just the unsuccessful characters, who are mostly reduced to stereotypes that veer into being like hysterical D.A.R.E. rip-offs (maybe some of them, like an angry black youth, the passive-aggressive counselors, or even Serra\\'s older sister who is ratted out by the siblings as having taken a hit off a joint and almost thrown into the program, would resonate more if there was more time given to develop any of them). It\\'s that Gaglia is so unfocused in his multiple roles on his tiny $30,000 budget that not one side of whatever potential talent he has can come through. He over-uses tints, mostly with a shade that looks urine-coated), he jiggles his hand-held DVX camera as if it\\'s supposed to be intense ala City of God, occasionally a character will just shoot into frame randomly, his choices of music are like the worst selections possible from pseudo-indie soft-rockers, and there\\'s even inane fake interview scenes with Nicholas Serra (inspiration ?) and Krakowsky that feel about as false as possible.<br /><br />Could Gaglia just not get any interviews with the real victims he was with and resort to would-be artistically cathartic plan B? Bottom line, no matter how much from-the-heart true life stories may appeal to you, don\\'t bother seeing it in the theater, or even on rental, unless you love a final scene with two kids staring off into the digital-hued Hudson river sunset with the final words reading: Dedicated to the Kids.

It was interesting to see these pieces after having seen that film because it is so clear that his innovative and (usually) whimsical vision were present long before that film was released.<br /><br />Essentially \"discovered\" by musician Bjork and tapped to do the video for her film \"Human Behaviour\", Gondry went on to do several videos for her as well as for The White Stripes, The Chemical Brothers, Foo Fighters & The Rolling Stones, among others. All of the videos feature enormous amounts of color, are usually laden with fantasy elements (there are a lot of themes that involve time-shifting) and most either are ironic or dryly humorous. The total effect is completely intoxicating. I have always found Bjork\\'s videos to be wonderful and unusual, but all of the videos in fair succession of one another are a heady experience. The amount of work that went into The White Stripes\\' \"Fell in Love With a Girl\" video, which features the band as Legos, with every shot done manually is mind-boggling. Even Kylie Minogue\\'s \"Come into my World\" (I personally find her insipid at best) was extremely enjoyable because the video, essentially a mobius strip where Minogue is walking around a city block, was so sublime.<br /><br />The collection also features some commercial work and short films that Gondry has produced during his professional career including a beautifully shot black and white film called \"The Letter\". Having now seen all three of the collections released by the Directors Label series (including Spike Jonze and Chris Cunningham) Gondry\\'s work is the perfect addition to the series because he brings an element of bright imagination, and while all three directors are creative, his work is laced with a fancifulness that works as a thin patina, under which obvious intelligence lies. I considered \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" to be the best film released in 2004, and Gondry\\'s video work is a strong support for his talent and vision. I highly recommend it. 8/10 --Shelly',\n"," \"When you look at the title of this DVD you think its a live DVD. However you will be very surprised. It contains interviews from the band members the videos from one step closer, crawling, paper cut and in the end. It gives you a great insight into life inside Linkin Park. It also has some interesting extras like Chester Bennington's Tattoos and what they represent and some audio only tracks like high voltage and my December. It also goes in great detail about the making of the in the end video. The only negative about this DVD is that although there are quite a few topics in the DVD they don't go in a lot of detail about them. Viewing wise if you like linkin park its worth a watch if your not a linkin park fan its probably not for you.\",\n"," 'Scared to Death is the story of a woman\\'s murder told by the victim as her body lies on a slab in the morgue. Not surprisingly, she tells the story of how she was \"scared to death\" by a variety of strange events that occurred to her, shown in flashbacks.<br /><br />Frankly, this movie doesn\\'t have a lot going for it. I rated it a 4/10, which is probably higher than it deserves, simply for Bela Lugosi\\'s presence and reasonable (though not stellar) performance. The rest of the acting was okay.<br /><br />It starts off with a quite interesting premise-the narration by the spirit of the corpse on the slab. I had thought that it might lead to something interesting, but sadly the script and storyline seemed just thrown together and incoherent. Strange things occur that were presumably frightening enough to cause the narrator\\'s death, but that just bore the audience.<br /><br />Hardly worth seeing unless you are a Bela Lugosi completist, in my view.',\n"," \"<br /><br /> For the most part this movie was fairly funny and entertaining. The two leads do a credible job of playing their roles, and some of the things she does to drive him away are quite amusing. <br /><br /> However, a lot of this movie just doesn't make sense. And not in a slight non-sequitur that movies often have swept under the rug. No, I'm talking big-time here. This supposedly smart, worldly columnist for a Cosmo-clone tries to drive this guy away by being wildly psychotic and bizarre, not what would actually make sense: unattractive and needy. And then when psycho and bizarre doesn't work, she ends up going to meet his folks on Staten island. And suddenly the script writers seem to give up on trying to decide what she should be thinking and she just goes as herself, with no anxieties or anything. Nor does he seem to notice this difference. <br /><br /> Actually the whole Staten island sequence was excellent: funny, real, sweet, sincere... it just totally didn't fit the rest of the movie. It's as if the writers came up with that really great scene and then tried to find a totally bland hollywood movie to stick it in, where it vaguely makes sense. <br /><br /> It's hard not to let this bother you. It reminds me of bad sitcoms where things are too zany for anyone to just continue on trying to be normal, and yet they do.\",\n"," \"I can't say this is the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is definitely in the top 10. The premise of the story is sound enough, and that is what actually attracted me enough to rent this movie. Unfortunately, that is the only redeeming quality in this movie. The actors were given virtually nothing to work with, as the dialogue was absolutely horrible. Some of the lines sound as if they might have been penned by Ed Wood himself, until you consider that Woods' work at least had some naive charm about it. The acting was atrocious. Every single actor in this movie seemed to mail it in at the same time, and it was not all due to the poor writing. Finally, the CGI was extremely poorly done. There was no hint of realism at all with any of the computer work. The effects were cheap and lacked any sort of attention to detail, something the entire movie lacked as a whole. I have to be fair and say that like the previous reviewer, I only watched part of the movie. It turned out that the movie was dirty, and stopped playing after about 45 minutes. I decided it was not worth the time to clean the disc and try to find where it left off. My advice would be to miss this one completely. Don't waste your money renting it, and if it shows up on TV you can certainly find something better to watch.\",\n"," \"There are many kinds of bad movies.

I sat through it ONCE when it was on TV, never again.<br /><br />Oh it made me laugh all right, but not in the way it was supposed to. I just couldn't believe this movie was actually MADE. Let me put it to you this way: Take the most horrible thing that's ever happened to you, and keep on multiplying it by a thousand. 'Meet the Deedles' is even worse than that.<br /><br />...This movie just plain terrified me.

So from this partial list of his credits, it's obvious he's an amazing talent. However, if you watch this very early effort that he made while in film school, you'd probably have a hard time telling that he was destined for greatness. That's because although it has some nice camera-work and style, the film is hopelessly dull and uninvolving. However, considering that it wasn't meant for general release and it was only a training ground, then I am disposed to looking at it charitably--hence the score of 4.<br /><br />By the way, this film is part of the CINEMA 16: European Shorts DVD. On this DVD are 16 shorts. Most aren't great, though because it contains THE MAN WITHOUT A HEAD, COPY SHOP, RABBIT and WASP, it's an amazing DVD for lovers of short films and well worth buying.\",\n"," \"I started watching this show in 2006, probably the last season it was in production, and now enjoy the reruns every night. What a thoughtful and funny show. It rivals and possibly exceeds all of Bill Cosby's shows with family humor that never sinks to the low humor used on so many situation comedies. Each show is an original and enjoyable learning experience. The actors are great, especially Bernie and the adorable Jeremy Suarez (I just want to squeeze that child, he is the cutest child ever), and the music is fabulous. All in all, one of my favorites. I love the way its shot and how Bernie addresses America. It's just so good, I wish it was still in production so I could see more of it.

With his beautiful human stories like Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and 3-Iron, he has come up with a very human story of a different sort.<br /><br />One of the most incredible and searing performances I have seen in years by Jae-hyeon Jo, as Han-ki, the Bad Guy, and almost totally wordless. His eyes tell as much about the way he is feeling as any words can. The raw human emotions are amazing. Watching Sun-hwa go from the most innocent girl into the call girl that she becomes makes your heart break but then watching how she begins to feel about the Bad Guy at the end tempers this a little. And that ending, with that traveling den of iniquity makes you feel both sorry for the two and at the same time you feel that these two people have found something that they have been looking for. Once again an Asian film maker ends a film realistically unlike American film makers who always go for the happy ending which would have ruined this story. I do hope that no American film maker decides to remake this film',\n"," \"I saw this film at a screening in LA recently and truly enjoyed it. Genuine and full of heart, and I thought the acting was terrific. I don't know why Danny Aiello hasn't had more leading roles before this, and I was impressed by Jane Curtain in a drama since she's really only been in comedies, like SNL. Once I was immersed in the story, I really felt for these characters, and I could definitely identify with the son's conflicted feelings of loyalty towards his dad and his dad's business. No matter what happens, you will always love your parents, but often times there are things about them that drive you crazy and make you swear you'll never be like them. I thought this movie was well-written -- the dialogue seemed like conversations between real people, not trite like a lot of Hollywood movies. Nice to see an indie that you can actually relate to.\",\n"," 'Fall Time is an incredibly absurd crime drama that fails on most levels. David Arquette, Jason London, and Jonah Blechman star as three teenage lads who decide to play a prank on the grownups in their boring 1950s backwoods town. Normal, run of the mill teens would TP town hall, put itching powder in the school principal\\'s undergarments, or short sheet each others beds. These bright sparks decide to stage a phony assassination outside the local bank, where, just by chance, two real cons (Mickey Rourke, who phones in his performance, and Stephen Baldwin) are about to hold up the joint. The prank and the robbery go the way of a Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cup (\"you got your practical joke in my two-bit heist!\" \"No, you got your two-bit heist in my practical joke!\") and mayhem, torture, gunplay, and a homo-erotic subplot take us the rest of the way. Though someone clearly spent a lot of time making sure the period details were right, someone else--presumably screenwriters Steve Alden and Paul Skemp-- larded their absurd story with too many handy dandy coinkidinks. The film also suffers from a portentous score from composer Hummie Mann, which elevates the final scene--involving a fresh baked pie from good ol\\' Mom--to the overdone levels of a Richard Harris and Jimmy Webb collaboration. Fall Time also features the world\\'s least believable sex scene (involving Sheryl Lee). This is one of those American indies that thinks it\\'s being deep, but merely buries itself in pretentious tomfoolery.',\n"," \"I liked Adam and Eve because it is a nice romantic comedy which contains college humor as romance ass-well. It maybe just gets a little boring, and the relation between Adam and eve does not really develops true the movie, but maybe that was the whole point?

It should be pointed out that the title sequence is preceeded by an action sequence featuring a band of terrorists who detest American greed . I`ve also got to point out that having the terrorist attack take place before the title sequence somehow feels wrong . The title sequence should have been shown before the terrorist raid .<br /><br />After the title sequence we`re shown what these spoiled rich kids are capable of , and boy are they capable of anything , they can defuse a nuclear missile , blow away hundreds - And I`m talking literally of hundreds - of bad guys without suffering a scratch and show us what lovely white teeth they have . I guess being part of an elite anti terrorist has its benefits since they all obviously have access to elite dental treatment - Is this why the movie is called ELITE ? The goes on and I found it very difficult to empathise with 20 something Americans with great hair and great teeth who can do absolutely anything in a tricky situation without suffering a scratch so I found myself siding with the anti capitilist villains which I suppose is something of a compliment to the screenwriter , all too often the motivation for the bad guys is too vague or too over the top unlike here where I could identify with the European villain who has a pathological hatred of globilization and free market economics . Only thing is I don`t believe the audience were actually meant to identify so clearly with the bad guy, it was only after being battered over the head as to how well educated and well off the heroes were that I found myself cheering for the baddies in a film that feels like it was cross bred with GOLDENEYE and BEVERLY HILLS 90210',\n"," \"These reviews are obviously biased in some way. 10 out of 10. Seriously. This is the Godfather of Green Bay not The Godfather. I'm giving it a 1 just to offset you people. This movie is a complete waste of time.

I know that it probably was done for a very small budget and it is an independent film, but that doesn't excuse some things. <br /><br />The two main characters that are supposed to be comedians have absolutely nothing funny to say and every attempt at a joke is awkward. The lead, Pete Shwaba, is so wooden. He brings nothing to the screen. How did he get Lauren Holly for this mess. I felt so sorry for her while watching this movie. Of course Mr. Shwaba and her have zero chemistry. Miss Holly, I hope that check cleared. For someone who I am told claims he is a comedian, Mr. Shwaba couldn't deliver a punchline in this movie. The writing is ridiculous. The mac-arena... come on. Doesn't work on any level, kitsch or otherwise. The directing is amateurish at best filled with close-ups and awkward staging. I've used the word awkward twice now, but it sums it up. If you see this movie, beware. You will have that weird feeling in your stomach. It is awkwardness. Awkwardness that you spent money on this experience. Awkwardness about how to leave the theater discreetly. Don't worry. You aren't alone.

Many attractive and pricey homes in Southern Calfifornia are designed and built to take advantage of the cleanest energy around, the sun. I live in a loft, which is exposed to total sunlight on its roof the entire day. I hardly use the AC - I\\'m sure it would consume too much electricity to convert the intense heat in the attic to about five degrees cooler.

I think there are enough comments posted here to enlighten those who still fear it like the plague: they ARE safe. TMI is still on-line....<br /><br />Director James Bridges carefully guides this plot (by Mike Gray-T S Cook) to build suspense and to a thoughtfully interesting film. All the roles were well-played: Jane Fonda (\"Kimberly Wells\"), Jack Lemmon (Jack Godell\") and producer Michael Douglas (\"Richard Adams\") are all excellent in their roles, plus all of the rest of the cast. I, too, loved there being no score. It was so interesting to get a true-to-life glimpse of the behind-the-scenes of the TV industry - that shouldn\\'t be surprising. Currently, Dan Rather is sue-ing CBS, and I hope he wins. Can you believe Donald Trump saying \"he\\'s a loser\" ? Trump - who cares? \"tiberius1234\" posted a very good comment here - I agree. It is my opinion that getting \"vaporized\" by a nuclear spill is much better than living in a world which has been wasted, and becomes \"Blade Runner\" and/or \"Solyent Green\".

I Recommend it to the whole family....',\n"," 'If one rates a film on visuals alone, Fellini\\'s SATYRICON would surely be completely off the scale: a phantasmagorical mixture of sensual beauty and the distasteful but evocative grotesque set in an ancient Rome that never was, never could have been, and yet which plays up to every extreme concept we secretly harbor about Roman decadence. The leading men are incredibly beautiful; the women are generally seductively depraved; and the broad vision that Fellini offers is easily one of the visually stunning creations ever put to film.<br /><br />And yet, oddly, the film is sterile. The story is impossible to describe, a series of largely unrelated events in the lives of two impossibly handsome youths (Martin Potter and Hiram Keller) who begin the film by battling over the sexual favors of a slave boy (Max Born) who alternately unites and divides them until all three find themselves sold into slavery and flung from adventure to adventure, most often with sexual (and frequently homosexual) connotations. Clearly, Fellini is making a statement about the triviality and emptiness of a life lived for physical pleasures alone.<br /><br />But the film is jumpy, disjointed, disconnected; the sequences do not always arise from each other in any consistent way, leaving viewers with a sort of \"what the ...\" reaction when the film unexpectedly shifts without explanation. (This is actually in keeping with the original ancient text, of which only portions remain.) In consequence, SATYRICON is ultimately less about any philosophical statement Fellini may have had in mind than it is about sheer pictorial splendor and deliberate weirdness.<br /><br />Whatever its failings, it is an astonishing film, and one that would have tremendous influence on a host of directors who followed in Fellini\\'s wake--although all to often without his style and vision. Clearly Pasolini, director of such works as SALO, ARABIAN NIGHTS, and CANTERBURY TALES spent the better part of his largely unlamented life trying to out-Fellini Fellini; likewise, it is impossible to imagine how Tinto Brass and Bob Guccione arrived at the notorious CALIGULA without reference to Fellini\\'s SATYRICON.<br /><br />Such efforts to expand on SATYRICON were merely more explicit and less interesting than the original, and I do not really recommend them--nor do I really recommend SATYRICON for any one other than Fellini fans, for with its oddly disjointed feel it is unlikely to please those raised on mainstream. Still, it is a powerful, remarkably beautiful, and completely unexpected film that must be seen at least once by any one with a serious interest in world cinema, and to those I recommend it without hesitation.<br /><br />Gary F.

She is so annoying I lost interest in this story. The scenes where Malone freaked out over Lon\\'s parents being deaf and dumb, and her subsequent tirades, plus Chaney apologizing for his parent\\'s physical handicaps - come on!! - totally turned me off.<br /><br />It also looked strange to see Cagney in his mid \\'50s playing a guy in his early \\'20s.

I wonder why the film just didn't work out at all. I wonder why the movie failed to score any major points in my book. In particular, what was it about the film which dragged it down, and made it the director's worst film of his career?<br /><br />Well it's not too hard to figure out really. Let me just say that it truly is a shame that Kar-wai so abruptly went down this hell-hole of mediocrity and poorness in moviedom, especially considering the fact that in the same year he released Chungking Express, one of his enduring legacies and an absolutely sublime film. So \\x96 what went wrong? It would be suitable to consider Ashes of Time as somewhat of an experimental film. Our director essentially places his own inimitable style of film-making and places it in an entirely different setting, mood and atmosphere; what results is a catastrophic film which is all over the place and simply does not work out. Hence, it would be even wiser to call Ashes of Time a failed experiment. Bold, audacious and innovative, but a failure nonetheless.<br /><br />Let me elaborate. Those who have seen the films of Mr. Kar-wai, a Hong Kong-born film auteur who's made his mark on the art-house world since his debut in the late-80's, will know that there is an overriding aesthetic which binds all of his movies together; essentially and frankly speaking, they're all colourful, thought-provoking, amiable, subtly humorous and meaningful evocations of life, love and loss. The same formula is transposed into Ashes of Time; however, the regular setting of Hong Kong is ridden of, and in its stead we're placed into the setting of ancient China, and the land of the legendary martial arts warriors and clansmen.<br /><br />Intertwined into this quasi-adventure/historical caper is the typical Kar-wai love story, this time involving an elegiac hit-man who has moved to the middle of the desert, and is carrying out contract killings. However, I must stop myself there; description of characters is a useless thing to do. Why? Because not a single character in Ashes of Time is worth mentioning or nothing. What a bland cast, and what a waste of talent (the case of Ashes of Time contains nearly all regular Kar-wai collaborators).<br /><br />Not only that, but the film is essentially endless incessant rambling in a horrendous, almost non-existent narrative structure. One of the main reasons why detractors of Ashes of Time berate it is because it seems to possess no plot whatsoever, let alone a semblance or an indication of one. You can definitely see what they're getting at, even from the first two, three minutes, maybe less, of the film. Perhaps it's just the atypical setting of ancient China which is unaccustomed and inappropriate for Kar-wai's typical film-making style. I like to think, however unfortunate it may be, that Mr. Kar-wai just stuffed up big time here.<br /><br />One thing that a reviewer can actually compliment in Ashes of Time, albeit said compliment being starkly isolated, is another director trademark \\x96 wonderful, colourful and blissful aesthetics. What joyous colour is composed on-screen, what glorious textures are painted for us, and what breathtaking landscapes and imagery are captured for us throughout the entire movie. We can at least take this as a sign that Wong Kar-wai is still there at heart, and it's just the film which is so atypical, and buries his usually commendable nuance. Although the visuals aren't enough for us to fully absolve Kar-wai for this disastrous venture, they're enough to make the film worthwhile \\x96 and at least we don't walk out of the movie in a completely and totally cantankerous mood, now that there's something we can think of nicely.<br /><br />The film is essentially a 'wuxia art' film, following in the style of, say, legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. However, one thing differentiates Kar-wai's film from Kurosawa's best, and that's that in the Japanese director's films everything gels together and simply works. In Ashes of Time, nothing seems to work. Kar-wai's attempt to make a genuinely profound wuxia film, let alone an intellectual and provocative movie in general terms, is a futile endeavour.<br /><br />Kar-wai claims that making Ashes of Time exhausted him, and that he needed time to clear his head. It must've certainly been a fatiguing effort on his behalf, as his exertions are embodied in the film and transferred to us directly \\x96 I mean, just watching the film is an exhausting effort, and now I need time to clear my head of this unpleasant movie-going experience.\",\n"," 'The gist of my too-long ramble below is there probably is, at least definitively within the film, no answer to the \"Why?\" of Matteo, and that Nicola as he ages increasingly embraces the status quo. Blame inevitable age, if you like, but it doesn\\'t happen to their mother.<br /><br />Way back, among some finished and unfinished novels that migrate to each computer I buy but that otherwise I no longer bring myself to look at, is one in which my Myshkin-like protagonist lies up a minor tragedy to cause his various acquaintances who have nothing to do with one another to show up at one place at the same time. The Russian Myshkin couldn\\'t lie, of course, but mine did. Just to see, I guess: a sort of wish-fulfillment, curiosity that killed the cat or made the student\\'s mind viable or kept the oldster\\'s young and nimble. Lying is storytelling is lying. The act of writing allows, or allowed, me, playing god just like that character of mine, to introduce to one another versions of people I known but whose paths never crossed otherwise. A tragic, now late, slow guy from work somehow occupies my vacation-vacant condo and hits it off with my garrulous but uneducated father. That kind of thing. Or, as Myshkin, I grab one or another misplaced acquaintance, long gone well before my mountaineering days, and march her way above the timberline to some icy col only to play at not knowing the way back down while sweet panic and thunderheads well.<br /><br />I don\\'t want to get into most La Meglio gioventù\\'s maybe merits, the pacing and rhythms gained by extraordinary length, the credible aging and acquisition of Time\\'s wisdom, whether for growth or stagnation, in most the characters, the relatively quiet interpolation of passing history. But the sadly heavy-handed, grossly unnecessary insertion of Matteo\\'s \"ghost\" into the closing scene between Nicola and Mirella made me realize what an orgy of wish-fulfillment the second half is. Suddenly, seemingly because Life or Time heals but maybe just so the filmmaker could resolve things for us, nearly everyone meets everyone. Even at six hours, a story\\'s tick needs its tock. Whether or not director Giordana and his writers intended the nearly dead center division, Part One ticks, and then Part Two tocks.<br /><br />If this is more than just a really, really good soap opera, then there have to be ambiguity, loose ends, disappointments that come more from life\\'s constraints than from audiences\\' need for reassurance and resolution. Why, other than to create suspense, does Nicola deny Giorgia\\'s need be involved in finding Mirella? He\\'s suddenly so uncharacteristically lacking in empathy. If he\\'s hurting over Matteo, then he\\'s selfish. If he\\'s just being professional, then we\\'re denied his rationale. I can easily dream up justifications within Nicola\\'s character, but, watching, I sensed a filmmaker struggling to twist an ending out of events that in reality must fractal along indefinitely. With possible exceptions of Nicola\\'s mother and perhaps his too-young-yet, barely formed though marriageable, daughter, Mirella seems the sanest creature in the film, Fate\\'s gift to this at least slightly askew family. Has Nicola even told her about Giorgia, and in what terms? Inevitably she will meet Giorgia (Tiny piece of a six-hour sequel?!), but the film denies us the experience.<br /><br />Matteo\\'s so ever-present, and all the more so as the film progresses, in no small part because of Giorgia\\'s obsession, that that bit of magic realism offended me as a viewer. Don\\'t plaster on the screen what\\'s already there: don\\'t double images. Besides, I\\'m not at all certain the living Matteo would have been so generous. The sequence suggests suicide\\'s a path to peace of mind, a return to balance or to freedom from self (What?! Does Matteo reach Enlightenment? Aurrgh!), but no one can know this. Are the filmmakers saying that Matteo by self-abnegation, self-destruction, restored balance to his family? Probably not, but how cruel the suggestion! Even so Matteo\\'s the glue here, the MacGuffin, a key of some sort. I\\'ve sat through enough director Q & As to suspect there may be no explanation. Ambiguity\\'s a storyteller\\'s tool. Ambiguity, red herrings, in stories not by genre mysteries cue ineptness from hacks, but deliberation from pros. Matteo\\'s case abounds in red herrings. Despite the transvestite, I don\\'t think he\\'s gay (all I saw in the episode was self-loathing, and nowadays they would have simply told us so; the day he first flirts with Mirella, despite his holding back, he seems no less enthralled than Nicola will be later). Despite the cop stuff, the look, the gun, I don\\'t think he\\'s political (they could have involved him against Nicola\\'s terrorist love but don\\'t; Nicola though, by surviving so wholeheartedly within the status quo does come off political). Surely each of us, as I think the filmmakers intend, will find a different key to Matteo. Empson, writing about ambiguity, usually says not that one or another reading is \"it,\" but that all are present and in play. Matteo\\'s mystery allows the filmmakers\\' artifice to breathe. If I see any clue, it lies way back, the day or two with Giorgia, when she, if not he, knew him already a soul broken in some way that her experience had taught her to understand. Whatever was wrong with him likely was already wrong then. I don\\'t know what it was, but banishing from the film\\'s close the first and only character who \"got it\" seems to doom the whole family, if only in the sense of their not \"getting it\" about Matteo and Giorgia. It seriously undercuts that silly ghost-Matteo scene.<br /><br />I know too little to speak but recall vaguely that there may be a genetic tendency to suicide: sort of a no-fault clause.<br /><br />Luigi Lo Cascio as Nicola, incidentally, looks like both Jean-Pierre Léaud and Dustin Hoffman, but, even saying that, I can\\'t see that those two ever behave quite alike.',\n"," \"Just watched this one again.

This leads our heroes to escape only to land in the arms of two insane killers that are in the process of torturing some people in a deli in a small town. Pretty soon it's a showdown with humans fighting zombies.<br /><br />I loved this movie! From it's different formats (black and white film, video and digital cameras) to the very fast pace and great music, there was always something going on and it NEVER bores you! Sure, it's cheap, but you can tell that a great deal of care and hard work went into this film. I have read other reviews and all I can say is that these people have missed the point. If you want 35mm Full Moon fluff, or if you are into modern stuff like Urban Legend, then I say pass on this. If you like low budget stuff like Gates Of Hell and Evil Dead, I say buy this now.<br /><br />The make-up and gore is very good, the acting is uneven at times, but over-all it is pretty good and the editing is very impressive. There is enough going on in this one to fill two more films! It is actually one of the better b-movies I have seen in ages.\",\n"," \"Now, Throw Momma from the Train was not a great comedy, but it is a load of fun and makes you laugh. The title may seem a little strange, but the entire movie isn't literally about that, although it is about something just as sinister.<br /><br />Danny De Vito basically wants to kill his overbearing mother, and fast forward a little bit, some random and funny events take place. The premise is quite funny, and the things that Billy Crystal and Danny De Vito get into were great. Some of the scenes seemed to not fit in for me, but this didn't make it a bad movie.<br /><br />For what it is, a wacky comedy, it pulls it off well and should be seen once just to say you saw it.\",\n"," \"a movie about a woman who starts fires as she becomes aroused..this movie will definitely not cause any fires..Could've been done a whole lot better on a scale of one to ten...2\",\n"," \"I saw it at the Legacy Theater in the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City this morning. I'm going to assume that one's level of enjoyment during this movie will largely be based on one's level of acceptance of Joseph's story.<br /><br />However, that aside it was very well made, well acted, and had a nice score. If you get to Salt Lake City, it is a must to see it in the Legacy Theater. I have never been in a nicer theater as far as picture quality, sound quality and ambiance in my entire life...I wonder if the Church would let me watch Batman Begins there! Being that I'm LDS and regard Joseph as a prophet, I was touched in several places and was brought to tears quite a few times...which I presume is expected since they handed out tissues BEFORE the movie started! Anyway, I'm told that this film is available in several LDS Visitor Centers around the globe, if you have 70 minutes check it out because whether you believe Joseph Smith or not, he tells a fascinating story.\",\n"," \"I am uncertain what to make of this misshapen 2007 dramedy. Attempting to be a new millennium cross-hybrid between On Golden Pond and The Prince of Tides, this film ends up being an erratic mess shifting so mercurially between comedy and melodrama that the emotional pitch always seems off. The main problem seems to be the irreconcilable difference between Garry Marshall's sentimental direction and Mark Andrus' dark, rather confusing screenplay. The story focuses on the unraveling relationship between mother Lilly and daughter Rachel, who have driven all the way from San Francisco to small-town Hull, Idaho where grandmother Georgia lives. The idea is for Lilly to leave Rachel for the summer under Georgia's taskmaster jurisdiction replete with her draconian rules since the young 17-year old has become an incorrigible hellion.<br /><br />The set-up is clear enough, but the characters are made to shift quickly and often inexplicably between sympathetic and shrill to fit the contrived contours of the storyline. It veers haphazardly through issues of alcoholism, child molestation and dysfunctional families until it settles into its pat resolution. The three actresses at the center redeem some of the dramatic convolutions but to varying degrees. Probably due to her off-screen reputation and her scratchy smoker's voice, Lindsay Lohan makes Rachel's promiscuity and manipulative tactics palpable, although she becomes less credible as her character reveals the psychological wounds that give a reason for her hedonistic behavior. Felicity Huffman is forced to play Lilly on two strident notes - as a petulant, resentful daughter to a mother who never got close to her and as an angry, alcoholic mother who starts to recognize her own accountability in her daughter's state of mind. She does what she can with the role on both fronts, but her efforts never add up to a flesh-and-blood human being.<br /><br />At close to seventy, Jane Fonda looks great, even as weather-beaten as she is here, and has the star presence to get away with the cartoon-like dimensions of the flinty Georgia. The problem I have with Fonda's casting is that the legendary actress deserves far more than a series of one-liners and maternal stares. Between this and 2005's execrable Monster-in-Law, it does make one wonder if her best work is behind her. It should come as no surprise that the actresses' male counterparts are completely overshadowed. Garrett Hedlund looks a little too surfer-dude as the naïve Harlan, a devout Mormon whose sudden love for Rachel could delay his two-year missionary stint. Cary Elwes plays on a familiar suspicious note as Lilly's husband, an unfortunate case where predictable casting appears to telegraph the movie's ending.<br /><br />There is also the omnipresent Dermot Mulroney in the morose triple-play role of the wounded widower, Lilly's former flame and Rachel's new boss as town veterinarian Dr. Simon Ward. Laurie Metcalf has a barely-there role as Simon's sister Paula, while Marshall regular Hector Elizondo and songsmith Paul Williams show up in cameos. Some of Andrus' dialogue is plain awful and the wavering seriocomic tone never settles on anything that feels right. There are several small extras with the 2007 DVD, none all too exciting. Marshall provides a commentary track that has plenty of his trademark laconic humor. There are several deleted scenes, including three variations on the ending, and a gag reel. A seven-minute making-of featurette is included, as well as the original theatrical trailer, a six-minute short spotlighting the three actresses and a five-minute tribute to Marshall.\",\n"," \"One of the finest movies I have viewed...Good script, original plot of a man who is haunted about JFK's assassination when he was assigned to protect him on that Cold November day in 1963. Thirty years later another anti-social lunatic wants to assassinate the current president. The secret service agent loses his partner along the way,to the crazed gunmen who schemes,lies and murders anybody in his path who'll stand in his way of his mission. <br /><br />The movie accompanies with a great memorable score,and a restrained but meaningful romance between Russo and Eastwood....which displays how difficult it is to have a romantic life in that kind of work.

The story of a teen girl\\'s exploration of her attractive power over boys, which she finds as irresistibly stimulating as it is doubtfully controllable, and which has an even tighter grip on her than it would on a normal girl because it affects her through her werewolfry--this story would have an obvious appeal to the young audience for which movies are made: an appeal of one kind to girls, and of another kind to boys: and I don\\'t understand how the movie makers could be blind to that and turn the story into one with little appeal to anybody.<br /><br />To begin with, take the title (which is the best thing about the book): it\\'s drawn from a Hesse quotation, also used as an epigraph, about a person running in fear and tasting both blood and chocolate in his mouth, one tasting as bad as the other. This is a wonderful metaphor for the heroine\\'s state: torn between her human and wolf sides, savoring each but equally fearful of both. The movie dispenses with the epigraph, and instead introduces the character working in her aunt\\'s chocolate shop! I can understand how the book\\'s title might have suggested to the movie makers the erotically charged chocolates of \"Like Water for Chocolate,\" and led them to want to link the same symbol to werewolves. But they didn\\'t; so why is it in the movie? In the book the characters are in high school--or in and out, as with the Five, a teen gang who favor black jeans and T-shirts, and fall somewhere between being the heroine\\'s nemeses and her pet peeves. In the movie they\\'ve become decadent twenty-something clubgoers. In the book the heroine is 16, just of an age to be discovering how her sexuality operates on the boy she wants, as well as on herself; she\\'s the one who initiates the contact, then steps back, re-initiates, and so on. In the movie she\\'s no longer a girl but a woman, and the guy is no longer a high school poet on the fringe of campus life but a fugitive from the law (and a comic book artist, to boot), it\\'s he who comes on to her, in a manner as unattractive as that of her wormy cousin. She initially puts him off, but then gives in, as he\\'s confident she will: hey, you know you want it. I would have thought a female director would have taken the chance the book offered to show a female protagonist in an uncompliant, proactive role; but no.<br /><br />In the book the heroine\\'s clan is driven from their home because of the Five\\'s delinquent behavior; in the movie it\\'s because she went for a run(!). She\\'s a great runner, prone to kicking off from building walls, and both she and her clanmates scale buildings in a trice; very like heroes of martial arts movies and very unlike wolves, or anything resembling them. In the book they don\\'t turn into actual wolves, but things bigger than wolves; in the movie they\\'re just ordinary wolves. In the book they metamorphose in \"Howling\" style, with crunching of spines; this is one of the things that make the heroine aware of the pain her body brings her, as well as the pleasure. In the movie the werewolves have become magical acrobats, taking great swan dives and transforming in mid-air, shimmering yellow like Tinker-Bell; it looks cool, means nothing.<br /><br />In the book the clan is a slightly white-trashy family that has relocated from West Virginia to Maryland. In the movie they live in Bucharest but all talk in different accents, none Romanian. In the book nearly the whole pack want to lead normal lives and agree that to insure that--and indeed, their survival--one necessity is to keep their true nature secret from humans. And so the characters keep saying in the movie; yet the head of the clan is some kind of underground boss--but apparently not a crime boss, since he despises criminals--and has a standing deal with the police, who supply him with \"meat\" for the pack. This seems a big exception to the rule of keeping humans from knowing; but maybe the police are considered safe because of their known tolerance for eccentricity and cult murder.<br /><br />At the end of the book the heroine learns she can\\'t be something she\\'s not when, in her effort to live a divided life, she gets stuck between the human and animal states, unable to be all one thing or the other. Her boyfriend isn\\'t sure or strong enough to accept her for what she is, the pack can\\'t risk having him around, and the two are forced to separate. In the movie she rescues him like Lassie, and they drive off to Paris (why Paris?), in an ending that\\'s smiley-faced but not really happy, since the conflicts between their natures--between _her_ natures--remain unresolved.<br /><br />But the difference in the movie that hampers enjoyment the most is that whereas the book characters behave conventionally, within the realm of young adult novels, those in the movie for some reason have been made as annoying as possible. Every other line is a threat or some other kind of oneupsmanship: you\\'ll be sorry; you don\\'t belong here; you won\\'t get rid of me; I gave you your chance; etc. I prefer to steer clear of people who deal in that way.<br /><br />There have been many good vampire movies, never a good werewolf movie. Had this one stuck to the book, it might have been the first.<br /><br />But no.',\n"," 'I watched this video because I like Malta and this movie was filmed in its entirety there. Very disappointing, since it fails to catch any of the flavor or beauty of the island - just the hot, dry, and barren elements. The movie was dull, boring, completely incoherent from beginning to end, pretentious, and devoid of any conceivable plot. You had to be a psychic to follow the plot line, or lack thereof. It had its moments, sure; but so does going to the dentist.<br /><br />In short, I\\'d much rather endure another colonoscophy before viewing this horrible mess again. It was so bad, I actually couldn\\'t fall asleep. There are quite a few \"Eurotrash\" movies out there that were obviously made without adult supervision. This is one of them. On the bright side, who is Nadia Cassini? Never before have I seen a more beautiful set of legs. She is the one saving grace of this movie.<br /><br />Disturbing, too, was the cruel boar hunt depicted in the closing credits. A boar that was released on someone\\'s property (Malta has very few native mammals; all of them small - rats, bats, etc.) and then set upon by dogs before it was shot. Oh, well - go visit Malta anyway despite this film - it\\'s a beautiful, colorful island; rich in history and lots of fun.',\n"," 'By the mid 1990s, the career of animator-director Don Bluth had seemed to drop to its all-time low. Before, Bluth had made a series of popular animated films, many which remain beloved today such as \"The Land Before Time\" (1988), \"The Secret of NIMH\" (1982), and \"An American Tail\" (1986). But beginning with \"Thumbelina\" in 1994, his films seemed to decrease more and more in quality and popularity and one of the many unfortunate entries is 1995\\'s box office bomb \"The Pebble and the Penguin\", a film that didn\\'t attract audience members beyond parents and children under the age of seven. Frankly, the latter are the only audience members I can comprehend taking enjoyment out of this rather bland animated feature.<br /><br />The story is absurd. The film stars a poorly-drawn, stammering, and chubby penguin named Hubie (voiced by Martin Short) who falls in love with a female penguin with a surprisingly healthy flower on her head (voice by Annie Golden). SORT OF like in real life, penguins present their bride-to-bes with a pebble as a substitute for a ring. But when Hubie is swept away by the current, he teams up with a lone rockhopper (James Belushi) with a dream of flying and they race against time to return to Antarctica before it\\'s too late. The reasons why they could be too late is one of many underdeveloped elements of this weak story that would still be weak even if they were there.<br /><br />It becomes very clear very early on why this animated children\\'s musical does not and will not work for anybody older than say six or seven years of age. It just does not have any of the qualities that are required for a good animated feature. Number one, the film looks bad on account of a very poor drawing style. The animation in this film is very cartoony (even as far as animated films go); it\\'s dark, gloomy, there is no vibrancy in the colors, and on top of that, the design of the film and the elements in it are universally droll and laughable. Take for instance, the penguins who star in the film. With only a few background exceptions, every single penguin looks absolutely nothing at all like a bird. Hubie, for example, looks absurdly ridiculous with wide cheeks, a stubby beak, big eyes, and that preposterous hat that he wears wherever he goes. Combined with his hand-like \"flippers\" he looks like Chris Farley in a penguin suit. Result: he\\'s an ugly, poorly-drawn cartoon character. But the most absurd-looking and absurdly-designed character is the evil penguin, Drake, who frankly looks nothing at all like a penguin. He\\'s a muscle-man wearing a penguin mask. He\\'s got a chest broader than that of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and teeth larger than the teeth of the leopard seals and killer whales that serve as the film\\'s predators. Basically, he\\'s a two-dimensional, recycled villain. He lives in a cave shaped like a skull, he wears a cape, laughs a lot, and gets mad when people laugh with him. Result: who cares? And what\\'s also bad, and maybe worse, is that this is an animated musical and there\\'s not a single noteworthy or memorable song to found anywhere within its running time. The opening hymn was harmless\\x97not memorable, but harmless. But after that, the songs became duller and duller and there was one in particular that had me grimacing all the way through. It\\'s the moment that viewers press the fast-forward button for whenever it comes up.<br /><br />I felt \"The Pebble and the Penguin\" was lame all around save for the very few moments when Hubie and the rockhopper penguin Rocko are placed in peril at the jaws of leopard seals and killer whales, who were thankfully, given no dialogue and treated as animals instead of cartoon characters. But in a way, for this reason, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this movie to children. This is the reason. The film displays killer whales are the natural predator of the penguins. My concern is that children familiar with \"Free Willy\" (1993) may be offended or downhearted by seeing their favorite denizen of the sea portrayed as a bloodthirsty carnivore. The leopard seal was a better antagonist and was more funny seeing as how his jaws opened wider than a rattlesnake\\'s and how he appeared to smile while growling. But the point really is, these moments with the predators\\x97and there are only a few\\x97are the only interesting moments. And they\\'re not enormously interesting, mind you.<br /><br />Bottom line, I cannot recommend this to anybody below the age of seven. My advice: if you have children around that page, rent it for them. They might enjoy it.',\n"," 'Louis Calhern is superb as Oliver Wendell Holmes.

The connection that developed between Brody and Madeline( forgot her real name) was intense, and if you can't see how their deepest desires are somewhat the same then you won't understand the movie.

Much revenue was generated by the Sheriff\\'s Department catching speeders. The ones who tried to outrun the Sheriff?

For example, in the beginning of the movie, a couple of servicemen on leave trying to get back to base on time are pushed off to their deaths, if I recall correctly. Then one day, a stranger drove into town. Possibly the coolest hot rodder in the world. Michael McCord. Even his name is a car name, as in McCord gaskets. In possibly the ultimate hot rod.

Well what Max forgot to tell Harlan that the money is stolen & that he has just become the getaway driver in an armed robbery. Bummer. Things get even worse for Harlan when the local cops catch him & chuck him in prison for a long time, however Harlan managed to hide the money before he was caught & with a nice $20,000,000 at stake & unaccounted for Harlan has to watch his back as the crooks want it as do Government agents. Harlan teams up with Ice Kool (!)(Anthony 'Teach' Criss) in prison & they both manage to escape at which point Harlan goes looking for some revenge...<br /><br />Photographed & directed by Don E. FauntLeRoy one has to say that the shot in Eastern Europe straight-to-video action films that Steven Seagal specialises in these days aren't getting any better & Today You Die is a good case in point. This is a terrible film, simple as that really. The script by producer Danny Lerner, Kevin Moore & Les Weldon gives Seagal a new sort of character to get his none existent acting skills around, that of a criminal rather than some Government agent/cop/soldier/one man army cliché he usually plays. In fact if you were being charitable you could say Today You Die is a rip-off of Mel Gibson's excellent thriller Payback (1998) where he too played a really nasty piece of work to such good effect. While Payback was a superb uncompromising hard edged film noir type action thriller Today You Die isn't & pales into insignificance by comparison. Unfortunately here Seagal is terrible, he has no on screen presence or menace either & the audience is never quite sure whether he is meant to be a bad guy that we hate or not. For instance initially his character's is set up like a modern day Robin Hood as he steals from the rich drug dealers & scumbags to give to the poor (as well as keeping a tidy profit for himself) which is just ludicrous in itself but then it has Seagal turn around & murder a lot of people which contradicts the likable criminal with morals that the film went to such lengths to set up in the first place. The story is full of holes, for instance Agent Knowles is contacted by the on the run Harlan & is then reprimanded by her bent superior for meeting him & it turns out that he found out by tapped her phone. In that case why didn't her boss use the information he had to catch Harlan? The story is the usual dull predictable bland fight over lots of money with surprise surprise the investigating Government agent is actually a bad guy! Wow, I didn't see that coming I must say...<br /><br />Director FauntLeRoy slows everything down to a snails pace & Today You Die feels like it goes on forever, the action scenes & set-pieces are also severely lacking in entertainment value. The infrequent fight scenes aren't great, most are either shot in shadow, very quickly cut & edited or with the camera played behind Seagal's character to try & disguise the fact that most of the stunt work done here is by a double. Again Seagal looks fat & out of shape & uses long baggy overcoats to try & hide it, it doesn't. There's a pretty cool car chase through the streets of Las Vegas in this at the start & I thought that Today You Die might be alright but it seems the whole sequence was stolen from another action film called Top of the World (1997) which is about a Las Vegas casino robbery, as well as using footage from that film Today You Die also edits scenes from the Charlie Sheen action film No Code of Conduct (1998), the Jean-Claude Van Damme action film The Order (2001) & the Wesley Snipes prison based action film Undisputed (2002) so quite how much of Today You Die is original footage is anyone's guess.<br /><br />Technically the film is alright, considering it's edited together from four separate films as well as it's own footage it's just about competent & consistent enough. All the footage of the US locations are obviously lifted from the films already mentioned with all the original footage shot on the cheap in Bulgaria. The rap style music that litter Today You Die is awful by the way. The acting is poor & Seagal just mumbles his way through his lines as usual.<br /><br />Today You Die is a really bad film made up from other bad action films, Seagal looks old & fat, the action scenes are average at best & most of the story is fairly random & it doesn't come together at the end that well at all. One to avoid unless your a die hard Seagal fan, if such an animal even exists...\",\n"," \"A man and his wife are not getting along because of the wife's jealousy and drinking problems.

However, there is something I must say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the early 70\\'s in the choice of settings and clothing. The \"back to the earth\" philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that was not dramatically decadent, as portrayed in many later versions of the 70\\'s was right on, as was the \"don\\'t ask don\\'t tell\" pseudo-liberalism of the fraternity made up of east-coast intellectuals, except that I would have thought this was more likely of a New England school rather than one in Virginia, where I imagine the \"good ole boy\" mentality still dominated even elitist schools like this one. Another thing I appreciated and could relate to is that this was a time when homosexuality was not linked so much to leathermen or drag queens and I appreciated some homosexual roles not related to these terribly overused images. I felt it was very unfortunate that \"gay culture\" took on certain standard forms in the 80\\'s out of Castro and Christopher Streets and these defined the movement and left out huge numbers of gay men that were more subdued in their lifestyles.

She gives one of the most gut-wrenching performances ever seen on the screen. And for a Montana gal who had to brush the sagebrush pollen out of her hair before joining polite company, stow her lasso, and pretend to be civilised, how did she manage to master the accent and rhythms and patterns of speech, dress, and mannerisms of those real savages, the gals in those short tart's skirts who live in tower blocks in East London and are married to men who support Arsenal Football Club? (Ugh! Football! Makes me sick! And singing about a football club, how oafish can you get?) It all goes to show that Williams, like good wine, travels well, even though in this case it was from planet to planet. This film is so brilliantly written and directed by Sharon Maguire (formerly a television documentary film maker) that the combination of Maguire and Williams sets the cinema on fire and thereby justifies the film's title admirably. Excellent support is had from Ewan McGregor and Matthew MacFadyen as the two male leads, but all eyes are on Williams. The production values of this film are very high, and it is easy to be convinced that the big terrorist attack on Wembley Stadium has really happened, as the attack and the aftermath are all so real. However, this is not a film about terrorism, which is merely the backdrop, in the sense that world wars and civil wars have been for so many films in the past, from GONE WITH THE WIND to FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS to MRS. MINIVER. This is a film about people, but especially about Michelle Williams. Only a woman could have directed this. In fact, one is tempted to say that all films with terrorism backgrounds should be directed by women, because they are not tempted as men are to dwell on all the violence for its own sake. With a woman at the helm, this film becomes a people film, but a man would have strayed, taken more interest in guns and corpses and explosions (little boys going bang bang sometimes never grow up, especially when they have a budget and a cameraman handed to them). As a study of searing grief and despair, Williams has our hearts in her mouth, but don't worry, it isn't really a downer, it is simply so spellbinding looking at her and seeing into another dimension. She seems to be a tiny little thing, and it is almost inconceivable that such a small package can carry such a huge explosive power. This film really is an instant contemporary classic.\",\n"," \"MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me the definitive fan of David Lynch. He's a modern genius, because he's not only a film-maker. His stories and his style have a spell that cross the screen. So THE STRAIGHT STORY was quite a surprise to me, with its easy to follow storyline and sunny sets. Still, Lynch is there, and, while this is far from his best, it's a film not to be missed. Late Richard Farnsworth's performance is one of the reasons.<br /><br />8/10\",\n"," \"This is another boring low budget horror/monster movie. The video box art is quite cool (as usual) but the film itself is far too dull. The monster is a guy in a rubber suit, which usually would give you laughs due to the cheese factor, but sadly the monster isn't shown nearly enough to be entertaining. There's no gore nor suspense to be had either. The acting ranges from OK to terrible.<br /><br />Demon of Paradise reminds me of another horror flick in a similar vein called The Evil Below, which is equally as boring. All horror fans will want to avoid both of these films - all they're good for are the VHS covers.\",\n"," \"The film lacks style, i mean original style. everything looks copied including action, first appearances in the movie, songs, dialog delivery, etc etc. Yes, there the goof-ups were original, like in the beginning a car is shown with number UP**** number and few seconds later it starts falling down a hill with number MH**** . That was one in many goof-ups of the movie :) Anything good in the movie? yes, for kareena fans, if there are any, Kareena in bikini. For akshay fans, his dialogs and action stunts. Thats it. nothing else. So watch it on your own risk and don't blame the director or actors. Director is already insane and actors, i pity them.\",\n"," \"A difficult film to assess.<br /><br />The cinematography is stunning---one of the most beautifully shot and constructed urban thrillers I've seen from any country. Visually it surpasses most American productions in its lushness and moments of brutality. In terms of atmosphere, it's unforgettable; the character in the rain, in the shadows of alleyways, the iridescent shimmering interiors (shot in some beautifully seedy Spanish settings).<br /><br />A wonderful star-turn by Victoria Abril also carries the film. Her character, who cruises for sex in public places, is in turns pathetic and fascinating and drives the film forward even when the plotlines lag.<br /><br />Without blowing the revelation of the film, this also proves to be one of the most virulently AIDS- and homo-phobic stories committed to film. The film's positing of a Gay character as a crux of the mystery and the final moments of the story leans on a highly questionable exploitation of audience prejudices and anxieties. Taken at face value, it's an entertaining, well-paced thriller. Behind the surfaces, though, it's reactionary trash which preys on hatred and misunderstanding of sexual minorities.<br /><br />The audience I saw this film with applauded at the end, for the bravura filmmaking and good acting. I left with a bad taste in my mouth and ashamed that I had enjoyed the majority of the film until the last few minutes. Depending on where you're coming from and how far you're willing to scrutinize the context of this film, it will seem like a good, well-made movie or typically hetero-centric bashing of gay people, so common in movies from any country. Or perhaps both?\",\n"," 'This is simply the epitome of what a made for TV movie should be. It was a lazy Sunday afternoon when my wife and I were in grad school that we stumbled upon this. The cheesy acting. The poorly written script. The good ol\\' boys. The ridiculous, yet somehow obvious, cliché, and banal premise. The riding in pickup trucks with your propped-up wife-corpse. It has it all.<br /><br />You will meet familiar characters: gold-digging hussy, stupid rich boy who wants to make it on his own, friends-who-know-better, Daddy who knows better but drives son away. And the wife-corpse. Propped up. In a pick-up. <br /><br />Wow: and the title. Several things in our lives have been \"Texas Tragedies\" since watching this beauty. Everyone involved in its creation deserves a medal.',\n"," 'The genre of suspense films really takes a dive in this one. The big problem is IMPLAUSABILITY. I realize that you need to create difficult situations which would cause suspense and the tense feeling of whats going to happen next, but this movie was so predictable, and is just not believable. I find that the more I watch this kind of movie, the more I am continually saying things to actors to direct them away from danger. Continually making bad decisions just borders on being plain stupid. If they took the time to make it more realistic, I might have enjoyed it a little. Having said that, you might be better off staying away from this one.',\n"," \"Jean-Jacques' career began with his essay answer to a prize question: civilization makes us evil. This intelligent and exciting movie supports that argument. In that sense it repeats a theme common to French films: society is real, identity is a construction, freedom is criminal. Here the idea is treated literally. Both main characters find themselves, and each other, only when breaking rules. This discovery may well hold true in France; at any rate, it's quite romantic.\",\n"," \"This was bad. Really bad. Extremely bad. Let's start with the most important element of any movie: the plot. Or actually, the lack of any. If anyone sees the plot, please return it to the filmmakers. Questions... questions... where are the answers? Isn't a movie supposed to give at least one answer? Ah wel... The SFX. Now those were quite good, for a B-movie. Don't really have to complain about those (except perhaps the use, which they don't have) The actors. This movie was poorly acted, the characters stayed as flat as can be. But hey, there was no room for character development, they had to move the 'story' along! The overall feel. If you watch the first three minutes and feel like pushing the 'stop'-button, do it. You won't regret it.<br /><br />So, my conclusion: a one-way ticket to the trashbin for Ice Planet.\",\n"," \"This show is so much fun to watch. It is a wonderful story and the conclusion is just perfect.<br /><br />We bought the video a few years back and have watched it several times. Many of our friends who never saw it before have really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Everything is just right about it - the acting is superb, the look is just right. The music is elegant and the costumes certainly deserved the Oscar it received.<br /><br />Regarding the murderer, it is impossible to REALLY know who it may be. Everyone COULD HAVE done it as and all had a motive.<br /><br />When I first watched it, I thought that maybe Mia Farrow was the daughter of Maggie Smith (maybe because of the red hair) and somehow conspired. Then I thought maybe Angela Lansbury was only pretending to be drunk. They're are many possibilities.<br /><br />We both like this show a lot and highly recommend it.<br /><br />gord & lisa\",\n"," \"A wonderful, marvelous, funny movie that I watch at least once a year. A true gem-the writing is great, the cast is perfect, and the arch, somewhat affected performances more than do the trick-that's who these people are! Arch, affected, wanna be know it all rich kid snobs whose currency in life is their intellect and class standing. The fact that the action takes place in a few small apartments only heightens the genius of this film-these locations represent the small world in which these young people's lives intersect, in how they dole out their verbiage, how much belonging to a small group of people can dictate the every day thoughts of each member of the gang. The kids have not yet lived enough to be fully forming the opinions they insist upon shoving down each others throats, and the comedy comes from their own inexperience and total lack of thinking other wise. This is like a high brow Breakfast Club, smarter and much more fun for those of us not into stereotype titillation. With out a doubt on of my favorites.\",\n"," '\\'The Dead Next Door\\' is an ode to all things Zombie. A homage to Sam Raimi, Tom Savini and the great zombie-king George Romero; done on a next to nothing budget. Shot entirely on Super-8, and written, produced, edited and scored by J.R. Bookwalter; this thing looks and feels just like one would expect it to: Indie. I found the storyline to be about as entertaining as it could be. Zombies running amuck. Scientists trying to cure them by running tests (much like Romero\\'s \\'DAY of the Dead\\'), which end up being fruitless. Nice little original twist here too, a \"Zombie Squad\" who hunts down and kills them as in most zombie films, but this time they are roadblocked by a group of what appear to be leftist democrats trying to preserve the human rights of zombies. Haha. Not too far fetched in this day and age. Anyhow, this leads the Zombie Squad to a farmhouse outside of Akron Ohio, where an original group of doctors almost perfected a serum which could get rid of the problem once and for all, problem is now that farmhouse is inhabited by a cult of zombie worshipers, led by a Rev. Jones, no doubt a tongue-in-cheek dark homage to the madman Jim Jones of Jonestown fame.<br /><br />So it is what it is. A low-budget, ultra cheesy, terribly acted zombie gore-fest. By my standards of gore - my standards being Jackson\\'s \\'Braindead\\' as the godfather of gore for a zombie flick; \\'The Dead Next Door\\' is slightly below average, but still having enough squirting blood and decapitations to keep me happy. Enjoy this film with some mates and a few pints.<br /><br />4 out of 10.',\n"," 'This was the first PPV in a new era for the WWE as Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, Ric Flair and Sherri Martel had all left. A new crop of talent needed to be pushed. And this all started with Lex Luger, a former NWA World Heavyweight Champion being given a title shot against Yokozuna. Lex travelled all over the US in a bus called the Lex Express to inspire Americans into rallying behind him in his bid to beat the Japanese monster (who was actually Samoan) and get the WWE Championship back into American hands. As such there was much anticipation for this match.<br /><br />But every good PPV needs an undercard and this had some good stuff.<br /><br />The night started off with Razor Ramon defeating Ted DiBiase in a good match. The story going into this was that DiBiase had picked on Ramon and even offered him a job as a slave after his shock loss to the 1-2-3 Kid on RAW in July. Ramon, angry, had then teamed with the 1-2-3 Kid against the Money Inc tag team of Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster. To settle their differences they were both given one on one matches DiBiase vs Ramon and Shyster vs The Kid. Razor was able to settle his side of the deal after hitting a Razor\\'s Edge.<br /><br />Next up came the Steiner Brothers putting the WWE Tag Team Titles on the line against The Heavenly Bodies. Depsite the interference of \"The Bodies\" Manager Jim Cornette, who hit Scott Steiner in the throat with a tennis racket, they were able to pull out the win in a decent match.<br /><br />Shawn Michaels and Mr Perfect had been feuding since Wrestlemania IX when Shawn Michaels confronted Perfect after his loss to Lex Luger. Perfect had then cost Michaels the Intercontinental Championship when he distracted him in a title match against Marty Janetty. Michaels had won the title back and was putting it on the line against Mr Perfect, but Michaels now had a powerful ally in his corner in his 7 foot bodyguard Diesel. Micheals and Perfect had an excellent match here, but it was Diesel who proved the difference maker, pulling Perfect out of the ring and throwing him into the steel steps for Shawn to win by count out.<br /><br />Irwin R Shyster avenged the loss of his tag team partner earlier in the night, easily accounting for the 1-2-3 Kid.<br /><br />Next came one of the big matches of the night as Bret Hart prepared to battle Jerry Lawler for the title of undisputed King of the WWE. But Lawler came out with crutches, saying he\\'d been injured in a car accident earlier that day and that he\\'d arranged another opponent for Hart: Doink the Clown. Hart and Doink had a passable match which Hart won with a sharpshooter. He was then jumped from behind by Lawler. This bought WWE President Jack Tunney to the ring who told Lawler that he would receive a lifetime ban if he didn\\'t wrestle Hart. Hart then destroyed Lawler, winning with the sharpshooter, but Hart refused to let go of the hold and the referee reversed his decision. So after all that Lawler was named the undisputed King of the WWE. This match was followed by Ludvig Borda destroying Marty Janetty in a short match.<br /><br />The Undertaker finished his long rivalry with Harvey Wippleman, which had started in 1992 when the Undertaker had defeated Wippleman\\'s client Kamala at Summerslam and continued when Wippleman\\'s latest monster The Giant Gonzales had destroyed Taker at the Rumble and then again at Wrestlemania, with a decisive victory over Gonzales here. Gonzales then turned on Wippleman, chokeslamming him after a poor match.<br /><br />Next it was time for six man tag action as the Smoking Gunns (Bart and BIlly) and Tatanka defeated The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) and Bam Bam Bigelow with Tatanka pinning Samu.<br /><br />This brings us to the main event with Yokozuna, flanked by Jim Cornette and Mr Fuji, putting the WWE Title on the line against Lex Luger and it was all on board the Lex Express. Lex came out attacking, but Yokozuna took control. Lex came back though as he was able to avoid a banzai drop and then body slam Yokozuna before knocking him out of the ring. Luger then attacked Cornette and Fuji as Yokozuna was counted out. Luger had won a fine match!!!!! Balloons fell from the ceiling. The heroes all came out to congratulate him on his win. Yokozuna may have retained the title, but Luger had proved he could be beaten. The only question was, who could beat him in the ring and get that title off him?',\n"," 'This movie is one of the only historical documents displaying the talents of so many black singers, actors, actresses, and dancers.

This is why those individuals still living today as well those who are deceased are super star icons.

The best part if this movie is the father son relationship which is a tearjerker. the song interludes is just placed at the right time, the scenery is good, the only part where this movie fails is where the jokes between Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav the jokes are too long and after a bit they are annoying, but overall this is a brilliant movie, i advise anybody Reading this review to go and watch it regardless of other reviews. 9/10\",\n"," 'You know, I want to like Lee. One of the great things about movies and literature is the ability to shock people. It\\'s a childish impulse at heart, but great when you\\'re deconstructing philosophies. In satirical cases, the childish impulse is justified by the purpose of the deconstruction. The need to expose the hypocrisy is much more than the jollies of the person doing the ripping.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Lee, satire requires a deft touch. Being too coy and the satire fails as a justification for the subject of the satire in the first place. Being too blunt and the satire comes off as preachy and self-serving. Lee and his work fall into the latter; he does not have the touch to do effective satire because he is too close to the subject matter. Lee has some valuable insight into matters of race (in that he never fails to remind us) and we take him at his word. Sadly, he is so bitterly one-sided that his preaching. Given his lust to bash all sides as a battle between him and THE WORLD, his movies often come off as diatribes that are disconnected from reality. The power of cinema is to put a person in a differing standpoint through prospective, and Lee doesn\\'t grasp that. To him, it\\'s a bigger stage for his ego and himself and we are \\'fortunate\\' enough to pay only a meager fee to finance his house to hear this Great Oracle of the Nike Commercials speak his wisdom..which is about as intelligent as a thirteen-year old Goth girl talking about death and cutting herself.<br /><br />The racial politics behind Drop Squad are so pathetic--rich equals white and poor equals black--is that it makes a mockery out of Lee\\'s MLK love. Lee never really grasps the idea of racism has a solid element of class-ism behind it. If you\\'re black, you\\'re poor yet humble. If you\\'re white, you\\'re rich and morally bankrupt. And if you\\'re black and rich, then you\\'re white and need to be knocked back down into being black. And with this, Lee\\'s world of racism is complete according to this movie. And that idea is so self-hating and overly simplified that it defies logic. Are we watching an examination of race relations, or are we watching a poor little rich boy deal with his unresolved racial/class issues by endorsing the same idea of Crab Theory--see \"The Corner\" for more on this in a much more mature way then Lee could ever imagine or wants to--that tortured him as he was growing up? In fact, why doesn\\'t Lee grow up and make movies a bit more textured instead of playing the game he was forced to as he was growing up? In short, Lee\\'s \"Do the Right Thing\" was the alpha and omega of his career. He would never show the same maturity or grow above it ever again. In a sense, he sold out himself, and the world is lesser for it.',\n"," 'It has been one whole year since the capers in Home Alone! And America\\'s favorite family is back again! It\\'s next Christmas and the family is going on yet another McCallister clan vacation. This time it\\'s to Florida! Christmas in Florida, well, according to Kevin,<br /><br />\"There\\'s no Christmas trees in Florida. How can you have Christmas without a Christmas tree?\" Good point. Kind of like you can\\'t have Easter without an Easter egg, or Halloween without a pumpkin. Anyway,<br /><br />[THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS, BUT THAT SHOULDN\\'T STOP YOU FROM READING ON!]<br /><br /> When Kevin goes to get his tie from the bathroom, Uncle Frank was in there taking a shower, who warned Kevin that if he saw Frank naked, Kevin would grow up never feeling like a real man. But he does anyway, and tape records Frank\\'s singing, but soon Frank discovers and Kevin runs. At the school, there was a pagent going on. There was a problem<br /><br />though: Buzz stood behind Kevin and was holding a candle. He held two of them up to Kevin\\'s ears, making him look ridiculous. Kevin found out and knocked Buzz down, causing a chain reaction that caused everything to fall. The family forced Buzz and Kevin to apologize. Buzz faked it but when Kevin explained, they didn\\'t buy it. Once again, another tizzy with his family. Next morning, they rush to the airport, Kevin with them this time! But at the airport, Kevin is sidetracked and<br /><br />follows a man in the same coat his father wore! So while the<br /><br />McCallisters boarded the plane to Florida, Kevin boarded the plane to New York!! So knowing his family was a thousand miles away, Kevin lived it up in the city. He bought fireworks, he rode in taxis, he even went to the top of the World Trade Center (Which sadly no longer exists). What Kevin didn\\'t know was that his old \"friends\" Harry and Marv broke out of jail and are in New York! They need money to leave the country! Kevin checks into the Plaza Hotel, where the sinister<br /><br />consierge, Tim Curry, was watching his every move. His hotel room is fabulous and he loses his shorts in the pool! He even orders a mountain of room service and watches \"Angels With Even Filthier Souls\", the sequel to the classic! So the next day while Kevin was enjoying a limo ride across town, Tim Curry discovers that the credit card Kevin used to check in was stolen. Kevin arrives at Duncan\\'s Toy Chest. A huge toy store filled with everything! Including Harry and Marv who are hiding in playhouses. Kevin is generous and gives some money to charity, so Mr. Duncan let\\'s him have some turtle doves from a mini tree. You keep one and give the other one to a special person, and as long as each of them has their turtle doves, they\\'ll be friends forever.<br /><br />Outside, Kevin reads a map while Harry and Marv depart from the store. Bad timing. They meet up with Kevin, and still having some left over bruises from last time, want to carve him into little pieces. Kevin<br /><br />runs, and cleverly gives them the slip, curtosey of a pearl necklace. But now the Plaza hotel staff is after him, but he outsmarts them with \"Angels With Even Filthier Souls\". Kevin escapes but runs into Harry and Marv. He escapes into Central Park! He stays there all night and runs into all the weirdos, so he finds shelter and runs into the Pigeon Woman! Kevin\\'s terrified but soon discovers a friendly woman underneath her tattered coat and pigeons. They have a talk at a concert hall. She teaches him that a<br /><br />good deed erases a bad deed, so Kevin thinks about what he can do that\\'s a good deed. He remembers that Harry and Marv plan to rob<br /><br />Duncan\\'s Toy Chest, but the money the store makes is going to the<br /><br />children\\'s hospital! Well that\\'s going too far. Kevin rushes to his Uncle Rob\\'s renovated townhouse and transforms it into the ultimate bobby trap haven! It includes all the trimmings: holes in the floor, monster sap slippery ladders and floor, tool chests falling downstairs, ropes dunked in kerosene for obvious reasons, and more! Kevin get\\'s the crooks to chase him there. Then, he hurls bricks at them, all of which hitting Marv. So when trying to enter through the front, Marv has a run-in with a staple gun. When he finally does get inside, he falls all the way down to the basement. Harry has tools topple onto him, his head catches fire, Marv has a shelf fall on him, a bag of plaster cover him to look like a snowman, and they both get mashed by a tool chest falling down stairs. They soon climb down the kerosene soaked rope after Kevin and find out why it was dunked in kerosene. As the rope is lit on fire, the bandits fall and get paint thinner splashed on them. Kevin knows he\\'s winning and feels great but doesn\\'t watch where he\\'s going! He slips and falls right into the clutches of Harry and Marv. They drag him into the park where Harry attempts to shoot him, but are attacked by a bucket of bird seed and dozens of hungry pigeons, curtosey of the Pigeon Lady. The police soon arrive and take Harry and Marv to jail once and for all. And, at the big tree in Rockefellar Center, Kevin and his mom meet up. The family was staying in a Plaza hotel suite! Yes, apparently the Plaza has started a new custom: \\'If We Lose Your Kid, Your Luxury Suite is On Us!\\' And what a deal that is! The family get\\'s a truck load of presents from none other than Santa Claus himself, Mr. Duncan. Kevin gives the Pigeon Lady a turtle dove so they\\'ll always be friends. And once again, all is happy and merry! Very! Until Kevin\\'s room service bill is brought to Peter (Dad)\\'s attention. He yells, \"Kevin! You spent $967.00 on room service?!!\" Then Kevin runs off. A brilliant film! Really lives up to the first one!! Great music, great messages, Good!!! It\\'s followed by Home Alone 3, naturally, but it doesn\\'t star anyone from the first two. It\\'s similar to the horror series Halloween. Halloween III was an original story having nothing to do with I and II. I\\'ll tell you about Home Alone 3 next time. For now, gotta go.

In this case, Dan Aykroyd plays a mental patient who poses as a psychiatrist, and he goes to Beverly Hills to sub for Charles Grodin. Most of the movie\\'s humor springs from their satirical look at Beverly Hills and people\\'s empty lives there (a woman has a power struggle with her maid).<br /><br />It\\'s the sort of movie that you just watch to have a good time. Don\\'t expect any kind of religious experience. But you\\'ll most likely laugh a lot at how the Beverly Hills people flaunt their wealth.

Actually it\\'s a great movie, however it\\'s very very underestimated also. There are two reason for that: 1- It took pressure from government in turkey before it began to play. 2- It isn\\'t understood. For example, even most of people who have watched the movie and loved it don\\'t understand who is the killer. It has a very heavy plot. First reason of the underestimation of the movie lead us to state fascism theme of the movie. Second reason lead us not only everyday fascism but also (and because of first one) state fascism. I\\'d like to say one more thing: We can read the theories of Foucault from the line spaces of the scenario. Power relations (goverment, pressure, Turkish word of \"iktidar\" contain the meaning of all of these) are in everywhere. In the state, in the school, sexual relations, in the family, in the neighborhood and (surely) in the examination room of a police station. **************************************Spoiler: I must turn the real question of the movie because you can\\'t understand things I wrote if I don\\'t answer that question. Answer: The killer of Spiky girl(Kirpi)is the police! For this reason censure committee tried to obstruct the broadcasting of the movie.Okay, how can we find the killer from the movie? Name of the movie is 9. There are 8 people (except the police) in the examination room. Mom 1, Stationer 2, American man 3, Greengrocer 4, Ex-fiancée 5, Photo Firuz 6, Tunç 7, Kaya 8, ? 9. Who is the 9th person? Where did the necklace (of Yiddish symbol)come from? Why did they (the police) stop recording before they beat and torture Kaya and made him confess the crime and sign ? If we don\\'t answer these, we can\\'t find the killer. Remember the words of Firuz: \" If you want, all things could have lived in a different manner.\" Tunç prefer to confess (or do) the crime because he didn\\'t want his nationalist (and praised) dad (the butcher) have known he had f*Cked Firuz. Firuz (who possibly knew the real killer) prefer to agree the accusation of murder because he want that nobody have known his homosexuality (and his love to Kaya)so he made up a different story about the murder with the police along the movie (and the reason of the pain he felt while he was sitting on his ass is not his regret!) and he tried to save Kaya from accusations while he was doing that. Salim the stationer (who possibly knew the real killer) panicked and told a lot of things because he tried to save Kaya (because he is his real father). American is an \"other\" and all neighborhood could accuse him for this crime. American and Salim are afraid of the reactions of the neighborhood (because one of them is an ex-communist and a cheater while other one is a foreigner) and they are easily persuaded to hide somethings for the possibility to continue their lives in the neighborhood. And Spiky is an \"other\" too and all neighborhood (Mom, grocer etc.)hate her and would like to kill her. But there is a video tape Firuz had recorded so suspects are Kaya, Firuz and Tunç. At the end of the examinations of the neighborhood, the police succeeded to make people accuse each other, make up false stories and agree the accusation. Finally, the police tortured Kaya (who don\\'t want to agree the \"confession\"), made up the \"necklace story\" so he signed. 9th is Spiky (Kirpi) who had been killed by the police (or us!) in the examination room of the police office. And the last question: Why we (or the police) killed Spiky? Katil polis! **********************************Spolier',\n"," 'It\\'s official, folks -- Hou Hsiao-Hsien doesn\\'t have a thought in his pretty little head. Are you wondering why he chose Shu Qi as his muse?<br /><br />Shu ( or is that Qi? ) doesn\\'t appear in this one. Instead we get a snaggletoothed Yo Hitoto, apparently a pop star in Japan -- judging by her song at the end, she\\'s a pop star just like the girl who serves you at Rockin\\' Curry is \"a actriss\" -- and a wasted Tadanobu Asano, typically an indicator of quality, who is required to do nothing here but stand around and look like a mumbling Asian hipster and is too old to manage even that. <br /><br />Hou\\'s philosophy? Life is limbo, a big nothing, feel it and move on. I\\'d like to do that but Hou gives us nothing to feel in Cafe Lumiere beyond a bland photo essay of Life in Tokyo Circa 2003 and the flabbergasting observation that people are ships that pass in the night, no, make that trains that pass in the day, never connecting, each hurtling to its own destination, usually some variant of a dark tunnel or maybe a bridge if they\\'re lucky. Yikes. Flowers of Shanghai is one of the most rarefied, technically accomplished and mesmerizing films of all time. How could the same director who created the opening shot of that film, which features about twelve actors conversing at machine-gun speed for about ten straight minutes -- an impossible directorial feat -- get trapped making this laconic sub-Jarmusch reality porn for two films in a row now? Millennium Mambo may be dead weight, but at least it has two great shots, shots that hint at Hou\\'s true calling as the film equivalent of Odilon Redon: Those shots are the sex scene with the arrhythmically blinking lights and the opening shot of Shu Qi floating down a blue corridor. His M.O. while making Cafe Lumiere seems to have been to remove the two great shots from Millennium Mambo to make it more consistent. You be the judge if that sounds appealing. <br /><br />Hou does not need to refine -- you cannot refine the limbo idea further than Flowers of Shanghai. He needs to expand, to bloat outwards, to release the inner expressionist and genre-revitalizer that is being squandered so senselessly on clichéd minimalism. It\\'s time for him to do a live-action remake of Akira or something. This kind of art film where the actors are supposed to be authentic because they are held facelessly in long-shot and speak in monosyllables is now every last bit as safe, ghettoized and stagnant as the Hollywood action blockbuster. ( What is the connection between \"reality\" and people who can\\'t talk? It seems to me that people \"in real life\" never stop jabbering. ) Then again, considering that 2005 alone brought big-budget movies as diverse and rich in ideas as Aeon Flux, The Island, and King Kong, it\\'s now safe to say that even Michael Bay has surpassed Hou, and that\\'s really sad.<br /><br />The good news is that, though Hou is in his 50s, it frankly feels to me as if he hasn\\'t even begun. There are a couple moments in this film that show the promise is still there, such as a moody bit early on in the bookstore when the room dims to a bloody sunset-red while Hitoto talks about babies with the faces of goblins. But whatever fear is holding him back, however comfortable it is to make the same film over and over and be hailed by the gullible and pretentious as the savior of cinema, Hou, your time as the darling of the Rotterdam, Venice, Toronto, Berlin and whatever else film festivals is almost up and people are catching onto your ruse double-quick. Two words for you: Atom Egoyan. Two more words, or maybe three: Tsai Ming-Liang. You are now cribbing from both of these tedious frauds who are about to go up their own dark tunnels forever. Risk your shirt on a sci-fi epic, sell out, be reviled -- but leave the social critiques to people that have no eye and no heart. Let your painterly talent express itself to the full. You\\'re not going to ever get out of limbo otherwise.',\n"," \"A movie about dealing with the problems with growing up and being true to yourself, Blue Juice is mind candy for those who like surfing and Cornwall. Sean Pertwee is the real star of this film, while the more famous Catherine Zeta Jones plays his girlfriend and Ewan Mcgregor plays his drug addicted pal.<br /><br />For those who don't like surfing or Cornwall in the slightest, you'll find that it takes a long time before the movie even hints at being interesting. The beginning is slow and spends too much time on long shots of only slightly interesting landscapes. Plus too many main characters leads to most of them being one dimensional. The plot is an interesting idea but because of the shallow characters you have no idea why they act in the situations they're put in.<br /><br />Only Ewan, Sean and Catherine's characters make this a film worth being on videotape, which is why it was only released on videotape in the US after Ewan and Catherine reached mainstream fame.\",\n"," 'Warning: may contain some spoilers.<br /><br />I don\\'t think I have ever gone to a chop socki movie and expected to see the next Titanic or the next American Beauty. I don\\'t want to see a multi layered, subtle film that has lots of plot twists and turns and characters that surprise me. What I do want to see is a bunch of guys beating the snot out each other and doing things that they should not be able to do. I love all the greats in regards to this type of film. From guys like Chuck Norris, Bruce Lee, Steven Seagal, some JCVD, Jeff Speakman ( anyone ever see The Perfect Weapon? ), Jackie Chan and of course Jet Li. I have seen every film of Jet\\'s released in North America and every film he amazes me with what he can do. I don\\'t really see the difference between a film like Crouching Tiger and Kiss of the Dragon. They are both fun, entertaining films to watch but they are not by any means worthy of Oscar consideration. but then again, you are talking about a bunch of fossils who think Shakespeare In Love is better than Saving Private Ryan. <br /><br />KOD is nothing but a pure adrenaline rush. Bridget Fonda is along for the ride and so is the guy from Bad Boys and The Patriot (Tcheky Karyo), but all you really need is Jet Li and you have yourself a great action film. But perhaps what separates this film from some of the other martial arts films if that in most fight movies, the action sequences are good, really good, but KOD takes some of the fights a step further. I was amazed at some of the choreography displayed. Not just by Jet but by some of his opponents. It is thrilling to see a small man fight two bigger men and watch them fall. That is exactly what happens when Jet meets two massive blond twins schooled in martial arts. As they say, the bigger they are, the harder they fall. And that is true in this case, but not before Jet takes a good beating.<br /><br />The plot, well, who really cares, but Jet Li gets mixed up in some French plot to smuggle heroine and he has to stop the perpetrators. As I said, the plot is really not the core of the film, even though it was written by Luc Besson. All you really need to know is that if you enjoy this kind of action, then this is one film that you can\\'t pass up. It will please even the most skeptical critics.<br /><br />One particularly amusing scene is when Jet walks into a police station to go after the bad guys. He opens one door to try to escape and buy himself some time and it is there that he finds a room full of black belts practising their karate. Jet takes his jacket off and invites all of them to bring it on. This reminded me of a funny scene in Wayne\\'s World when Wayne and Garth open a door and behind it there is a bunch of spies doing a bunch of spy things like climbing walls and fighting. They close the door and say something to the effect of \" I always wanted to see that.\" Well in this film, it isn\\'t so much a joke as it is a reality. It is one of the most impressive fight sequences I have ever seen in any film, with all due respect to Bruce Lee.<br /><br />KOD is not a Martin Scorsese film, nor is it a film by Coppola or Truffaut or Fellinni. It is a film by Chris Nahon that stars Jet Li. I couldn\\'t tell you what Nahon has done before this and to be honest I really don\\'t care all that much. If he continues to make films like this, with a flair for the ridiculous and an eye for action, then I think he will be around for a while. But what I can tell you is that Li is the best at what he does. And this is one kick-ass-action film. There is not much to dislike about it, unless you don\\'t like violence and then I would recommend you stay away. But if action and chop socki and deceit and betrayal is what you crave, then go see KOD.<br /><br />8.5 out of 10-- Some excellent action and fighting scenes make this one a great summer flick.',\n"," \"I was really excited to see this. I have never heard of McG and I have never seen any of his work until now. They said he was a bad director and they weren't kidding.<br /><br />Here are a few things I have a problem with: <br /><br />1. Where was the war that we get clips of from the first three Terminator films? The wars looked awesome. There was a HUGE battle going on. People dying, terminators everywhere, etc. It was intense! Here? Nothing! We only have around maybe 5 or 10 different terminators.<br /><br />2. Why was there a 9 foot tall terminator? Why couldn't the John Conner and the others hear it coming? Something that huge would probably make the ground shake signifying that something is wrong.<br /><br />3. Why didn't Skynet terminate Kyle Reese once they got their hands on him? I remember in the first Terminator, the terminator was merciless. He ripped that one gangster's heart clean out of his chest. Why didn't he do that to Kyle? <br /><br />4. Why does Skynet have prison cells that hold humans? Why are they capturing them? Why not kill them? Isn't that the whole point of their decision that they decided in a microsecond as stated by Kyle Reese in The Terminator? <br /><br />5. Why are there keypads on the cell doors? Skynet is one giant computer right? Why not have Skynet be in control of the doors? They don't need keypads! <br /><br />6. What was the whole point of Marcus? He was useless throughout the entire film! I didn't give a damn about his character in the slightest! He only becomes useful in the end when he gives John his heart. That was the ONLY reason he was there? You have got to be kidding me! <br /><br />7. Why did McG direct this? This guy is a moron and has NO talent! The movie has nothing to do with the others except for having the machines from the other films. The HK's, T-800s, etc. That was it. McG obviously didn't see ANY of the Terminator films.<br /><br />8. Why was this given a PG-13 rating? I think the movie would have been so much better if it was given a different director and a different rating. They thought they would make more money if they gave it a PG-13 rating? They were dead wrong! <br /><br />9. In the factory toward the end, you see Terminators being built! Why aren't these Terminators being deployed to kill John and the Resistance? It looks like they're being built in the factory but Skynet is not activating them! Isn't Skynet's primary objective to wipe out the Resistance and their leader John Conner? Why aren't they accomplishing this? <br /><br />10. Why was Arnold only added at the end? I guess since Arnold ran for Governor he couldn't do movies. Obviously he can't but they did a CGI version of him fighting John. I guess if Arnold wasn't Governor, they wouldn't need Marcus. They could have Arnold instead. Also, when Arnold fights John, why doesn't he just pull his heart out? Instead, he just tosses him around for about five or ten minutes. It's stupid.<br /><br />Those are the 10 reasons why I think this movie is garbage.<br /><br />I give this movie 1 star out of 10. Please don't make Terminator 5 unless you intend to make it good.\",\n"," 'This is one of the best films I have seen all year. I notice how few votes it has received and assume that it has gone mostly unnoticed. The words \"I don\\'t see how it could have been made any better come to mind.\". A psychological thriller which kept my interest level throughout the entire film. Thoughtful, believable, emotionally moving and extremely well acted. Highly recommended!',\n"," \"The first film ever made. Workers streaming from a factory, some cycling, most walking, moving right or left. Along with Melies, the Lumieres are both the starting point and the point of departure for cinema - with Melies begins narrative fiction, cinema, fantasy, artifice, spectacle; with the Lumieres pure, unadorned, observation. The truth. There are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of cinema from the latter into the tired formulae of the former.<br /><br />But consider this short again. There is nothing 'objective' about it. The film is full of action - a static, inhuman scene burst into life, activity, and the quiet harmony of the frame is ruptured, decentred from the back to right or left (but never, of course, the front, where the camera is). And yet the camera stands stock still, contains the energy, the possible subversion, subordinates it to its will. The cinematograph may be a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes - to map out the world, edit it, restrict it, limit it.<br /><br />worse is the historical reality of the film. These factory workers are Lumiere employees. The bosses are spying on their workers, the unseen eye regarding his faceless minions. The film therefore describes two types of imprisonment. Behind the gates, the workers are confined in their workplace. The opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom, escape, but they face another wall, the fourth wall, further confining them. The first film is also the first example of CCTV surveillance, an image of unseen, all-seeing authority entrapping its servants. A frightening, all too prophetic movie.\",\n"," 'This woman is a terrible comedian. She can\\'t crack a joke. She has no real character. This is another example of typical American rubbish, that people laugh at, because they have no idea how to react, so they say to themselves, \"well, it\\'s a comedy show,\" so I\\'ll laugh, I guess.<br /><br />I cannot stand this miserable woman, and her pi$$ poor excuse for comedy. She does not deserve anything but booing.<br /><br />Why can\\'t America dump this kind of turdish delight, and go for something that actually contains humour.<br /><br />She is not funny. Not at all. Why oh why does even ONE person like this idiot?',\n"," 'This film starts good. It leaves you wondering until it all starts to make sense. Unfortunately most of the most interesting characters get killed too early. There is some suspense and some strong music. Many parts of the film are more gut wrenching than suspenseful. This movie is mostly grim and depressing especially in the last half. You walk out feeling kind of down and a little sick. Even Milla is a little over rated. She is not that pretty with a weird nose. She has very little personality either. And all the graphic cuts and bruises are a real turnoff.<br /><br />She is no comparison to Angelina Jolie, the Mummy star, or even the excellent lead actress in Ghosts of Mars. I should say the other brunette female lead in the film who was also in Fast and Furious and Girl Fighter is very good with a powerful personality. But the \"I want to kiss you bit..\" line is stupid. I much preferred John Carpenter\\'s Ghosts of Mars. But you need to like Carpenter to like that film. Resident Evil is just more depressing than it needs to be. <br /><br />',\n"," \"Hilarious RKO comedy of 1940 with impeccable credits both cast and writing/directing and crew. With editing by Robert Wise! What a combo! Obviously a smash hit in its day and must have a wonderful experience to see in the 3000 seat movie palace. Screened a lot on TV in Australia, anyone lucky enough to roar with laughter at this almost perfect screwball comedy will instantly agree how hilarious and exact it is. In the 60s, it was ineptly remade as a Doris Day vehicle also successful and equally well crafted but not nearly as much fun. Somehow it works better as an art deco comedy. The courtroom scenes are almost lifted verbatim into WHAT'S UP DOC in the 70s. Interesting and sad too, to see the very talented child actor Scotty Beckett long before his untimely descent into crime and early death. The obvious rapport between housepals Grant and Randolph Scott is slyly enjoyable too. This is champagne Hollywood. Imagine a hideous remake today for the multiplex mob: Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore instead of Cary Grant and Irene Dunne... with Rob Schneider in the Randolph Scott role. Add swearing and punching and edit using a lawnmower.\",\n"," \"On first watching this film it is hard to know quite what has happened, but on a subsequent viewing it become more clear. I enjoyed this movie. Dean Cain was excellent in the role of Bob. Lexa Doig's character was confusing to understand, at first, she was out to trap Bob but i really believe she landed up loving him although by then she had broken his heart. Dean Cain's performance was an usual excellent. He gets better with every film he does. My only question at the end of the film was what happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby. It was left for the viewer to decide\",\n"," \"This movie purports to be a character study of perversion. Some reviewers have been gulled into assuming that because perversion is depicted, the film is psychologically deep; actually, considering the salacious material, it is surprisingly tedious and shallow, with no motivational substance. Why is the main character the way she is? You won't find out from the script. For a better treatment of the same theme (and a more entertaining movie), try Bunuel's Belle de Jour.\",\n"," \"No question, it is the best film/musical ever!!!

I was so unmoved by the squall that I felt moved to add my two rings worth.. The beginning of the movie starts out to look promising. The middle(longest part by a long shot)is so incredibly lacking in feel and scare factor, I was bored to death. The third part almost started feeling like they were going to leave us with a heart ripping adventure in to Samaras world. Only to be another boring, uninspired, and barely scary rendition of a scare movie. One part that should have brought a jump and a scare made me laugh and shake my head and say to myself, the scare is gone. Such a bummer this film was so poor. The first film was truly scary, and kept you on the edge of your seat, and when the end came it ripped you out of your seat. The Ring 2 makes you want to get out of your seat and leave. Too Bad..\",\n"," \"I'm sorry for Jean, after having such a good original movie to be followed up by perhaps his worst movie in is career.

Actually, I'm not REALLY sure WHAT the movie was trying to tell us, except that sometimes you just have to let GO! JEEZ!

I think that people who are have seen the film and think that it is haphazard are the same people who didn\\'t understand Pulp Fiction when it came out. The segments do jump around in a non-linear way. I got the connections right off the bat with a feeling of being at the event in some what real time. I loved the segments behind the scenes at the carnival and I especially loved the lesbian wedding segment. I thought it captured real emotion on the part of the women and drove home the sense of how much they loved each other. I also enjoyed the brief history of circuit parties. This film is not for everyone! I saw the movie with two straight friends and they also enjoyed it leaving the screening saying, \"I didn\\'t know there was so much to gay community\". I never really let them in to my life in that way and in turn they never realized that there was anything to these kind of happenings besides people holding hands and singing. The film will definitely play better to a straight audience or gays who aren\\'t directly involved in \"being gay\" in the ways portrayed in the film.',\n"," \"After reading about this notorious film i finally managed to get my hands on it.In some ways it lived up to my expectations but in several ways it did not.The female acting was good, male acting was bad, the sound was bad but the music was superb and spooky.Although still quite disturbing and gripping the violence displayed was quite poor and very overrated, and without giving anything away the supposed real footage at the end, wasn't worth waiting for (one reviewer even suggested that the footage was fake, surprise, surprise!!!)I'm glad I've seen it, just to say so but its not by far one of the most disturbing films I've seen..............unfortunately.........if it did not have the end footage to sell the film i would say stay well clear nothing new, but the fact that the film makers added this, give it a go.

I found the story convoluted and not all that easy to follow. There really isn't that much action until the end of the film and it's pretty dark and hard to see what's really happening. I was sure hoping for something different, but, alas, didn't find it here.\",\n"," \"In 1933 Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler sang and danced their way through three Warner Brother musicals that offered Depression era audiences a momentary distraction from their woes. Gold Diggers of 1933, 42nd Street and Footlight Parade were all set in the world of Broadway Theatre with basically the same theme of the show must go on. In addition to Keeler and Powell the films featured the kaleidiscopic choreography of Busby Berkeley, show stopping tunes and many of the same supporting players.<br /><br />All are arguably classics of their genre but I must admit a clear preference for Footlight due to it's pace energy and lead James Cagney. Warren William in Gold Diggers and Warner Baxter in 42nd Street acquit themselves admirably as the shows production heads- particularly Baxter as the burned out Julian Marsh in search of one last box office smash. Both lack the infectious energy of Cagney however, who perfectly compliments the frenetic pace of putting on a Broadway musical. He is an absolute whirlwind as he deals with production numbers, unscrupulous partners and a gold digging girlfriend.<br /><br />Of course Cagney alone does not make Footlight the classic that it is. The script crackles with some sharp double entendres delivered by a superlative supporting cast featuring Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibbee and especially Joan Blondell who cuts everyone down to size. Busby Berkeley's dance numbers are surreal, suggestive and risqué and done just in the nick of time before the arrival of the Hollywood Code in 34. Sadly, the thirties and sometime beyond would never see such a richly made musical with the verve and sass of Footlight again. Gentility and morality made sure of it.\",\n"," '\"Who Done It?\" contains many surefire laughs and gags. It is not only one of the best Stooges films with Shemp, it is one of the finest short comedies Columbia produced. Director Bernds originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the Stooges, but when Curly Howard suffered a career-ending stroke, it was tailored for the Columbia comedy team of Schilling and Lane (their version was released as \"Pardon My Terror.\") It obviously was too good for the Stooges to pass up, and it was finally filmed by the Stooges at the end of 1947.<br /><br />Old Man Goodrich calls ace detectives Shemp, Larry, and Moe out of fear that he will be murdered. When they arrive at his home, Goodrich has disappeared, and his niece and assorted goons try to get rid of the Stooges. Will they find Goodrich and bring the niece and goons to justice? <br /><br />Shemp is particularly funny in this film. His reactions after being given a mickey by Christine McIntyre are superb; he gives his trademark sound (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Miss McIntyre is noticeably trying not to laugh! Other funny scenes: the close-up of Moe\\'s mug looking through the camera lens; and the in-the-dark fight with all cast members involved.<br /><br />Nikko the goon (played by Duke York) is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a Stooges film. With his kinked hair, he could almost pass for a Stooge, if he didn\\'t tower over everyone else! \"Who Done It?\" is a gem among the Stooges films with Shemp. Even die-hard Curly fans will enjoy this one! A true Stooge classic. 9 out of 10.',\n"," 'I saw this for cheap at a used DVD store & picked it up, because I love the original \"Harvey\" and Harry Anderson certainly looks like he\\'d make a great Elwood P.

But when I started to watch this and got about halfway through, I realized that it has absolutely none of the charm or humor of the original, and that it wasn\\'t getting any better as it went along, so I stopped it. Anderson is OK as Dowd, but this is a flat production with absolutely no soul to it. The story is kind of the same, but there were differences from the original that made no difference whatsoever, and no member of the cast particularly stood out. This can\\'t hold a candle to the original & it\\'s going right back to the store I bought it from to be traded yet again. 3 out of 10, you can\\'t mess with a classic.',\n"," \"A paranoid scientist creates a wolfman by transfusing wolf blood into a meek, quiet, but very large gardener, in order to prove an hypothesis. So the gardener begins nightly rampages and the scientist tries to use him to reclaim his credentials, but is rebuffed by his former colleagues for tampering with nature. Island of Dr Moreau, Frankenstein and various wolfman films all blended together into a terribly dated, goofy, morality play.<br /><br />Though the subject matter is pedantic and unoriginal at best, this film is not too poorly made, and interesting to watch as a representative of horror film making of its time. Like most mad scientist films, this is a weak warning against fooling around with Mother Nature. It doesn't have the power or intellectual challenges of Frankenstein, but it doesn't ever extend its reach anyway. The acting is passable, as is the cinematography, and the film moves along at an entertaining clip. Some of the dialog is utterly ludicrous, but hey... it's just a movie - and a B minus one at that. There are also a few nice shots of a wolf, and a smattering of humor tossed-in to prevent the film from appearing to take itself too seriously - always a plus for this genre.\",\n"," \"From director Barbet Schroder (Reversal of Fortune), I think I saw a bit of this in my Media Studies class, and I recognised the leading actress, so I tried it, despite the rating by the critics. Basically cool kid Richard Haywood (Half Nelson's Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Bully's Michael Pitt) team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them. Investigating the murder is homicide detective Cassie 'The Hyena' Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) with new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene, e.g. non-relating hairs. The plan doesn't seem to be completely going well because Cassie and Sam do quite quickly have Richard or Justin as suspects, it is just a question of if they can sway them away. Also starring Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, R.D. Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. D.A. Al Swanson. I can see now the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcock's Rope with the murdering for a challenge thing, but this film does it in a very silly way, and not even a reasonably good Bullock can save it from being dull and predictable. Adequate!\",\n"," \"A lot of the problem many people have with this movie is that they seem to think that the story should have been more entertaining (ignoring it is based on a true story) or ranting against a film that glorifies Che (which it really doesn't). This film is very close to Jon Anderson's definitive bio on Che and gets the story right. Soderburgh does an excellent job of setting the mood for the unraveling debacle that was Che's Bolivian adventure. You really get the impression of the total timidity and bewilderment of the Bolvian peasant to Che's revolutionary ideas or of the difficulties that his men faced with hunger and the terrain. Sorry to bore the attention challenged movie fan out there but that was how it happened. So don't go into this movie expecting a Rambo shoot em up, its a true story!\",\n"," 'WWE was in need of a saviour as Wrestlemania 14 rolled around. The departure of Bret Hart and subsequent evaporation of the Hart Foundation had left the Vile D-Generation X stable unchallenged in the WWE. Their despicable leader Shawn Michaels had stolen the title from Hart thanks to the interference of Vince McMahon and, with help from his cohorts Triple H and Chyna had systematically taken out anyone who challenged his supremacy. But at the Royal Rumble a new contender had emerged. Stone Cold Steve Austin. Hated by McMahonagement, Austin had DX worried. So worried in fact that they\\'d enlisted the help of \"The Baddest Man on the Planet\" Mike Tyson as a special enforcer. Austin would have the odds firmly against him in his title match with Shawn Michaels.<br /><br />But first, there was an undercard to get through which kicked off with the Legion of Doom winning a forgettable 15 team battle Royal to become NO.1 contenders for the tag titles. I\\'d actually forgotten this match existed until I rewatched the PPV. No very good and really highlighted the lack of depth in the tag division at that period in time.<br /><br />Next match saw the Light Heavyweight title defended by Champion Taka Michonoku against Aguila. The WWE had established the Light Heavyweight Title to compete with the strong Cruiserweight Division in WCW. It was not successful and this was the only time the title was ever defended at Wrestlemania. Short match, going about five minutes, and in fact too short for much to be achieved. What little they did was exciting and this was a nice little match which saw Taka retaining his title.<br /><br />OK, our next match saw DX member Triple H defending the WWE European title, which he\\'d won in farcical fashion from Shawn Michaels on RAW in December and hadn\\'t defended on PPV, against Owen Hart, the Sole Survivor. Triple H got a big entrance with the DX band there to perform his theme song. Chyna accompanied Triple H to ringside, but was then handcuffed to WWE Commissioner Sgt Slaughter. Triple H and Owen have a nice little match, before Chyna interfered causing a low blow on Hart which leads to Triple H retaining the title. Good match, could have been great had it gone slightly longer.<br /><br />But of course we wouldn\\'t want to take time away from our next match which saw real life husband and wife Marc Mero and Sable defeat Goldust and Luna Vachon in the first mixed tag match at Wrestlemania in 8 years. And, in all honesty, it wasn\\'t worth the wait. While not terrible, the match was in no way memorable either. This was the nearing the end of Mero\\'s only run in the WWE and the main purpose was to continue the disintegration of his relationship with Sable.<br /><br />Next up we saw Ken Shamrock flip out and cost himself the Intercontinental Championship as he destroyed IC Champion The Rock, but then refused to let go of his ankle lock submission hold, resulting in the referee reversing his decision. This was a short match, but decent for what it was.<br /><br />Next saw the first good match of the night as WWE Tag Team Champions the New Age Outlaws lost their titles to Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie in a fun dumpster match. The decision was overturned the following night as Cactus and chainsaw had thrown the Outlaws into a dumpster backstage, rather than the one being used in the match, but this was still a fun match.<br /><br />NOw it was time for the highly anticipated first ever meeting between Kane and his brother the Undertaker. Kane had cost Undertaker the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble and then \"killed\" him when he helped Shawn Michaels lock Undertaker in a casket and set him on fire as revenge for the Undertaker burning down their parents house and leaving him horribly disfigured years before. This was a decent match and told a nice story as the Underataker absorbed everything Kane could throw at him and then knocked him out with three tombstones to end the match.<br /><br />This left only the main event which saw WWE Champion face Steve Austin with Mike Tyson as the guest enforcer. Michaels had suffered a debilitating back injury in his match with the Undertaker at the Royal Rumble and was remarkable in this match despite his physical limitations. Triple H and Chyna were banished to the back in the early going after interfering from the outside. The match ended with Austin ducking an attempt at Sweet Chin Music and hitting the Stone Cold Stunner with the ref down. TYson then came into the ring to count the three, celebrating the win with Austin and then knocking out Michaels after the match. It turned out Tyson and Austin were together and the cat had been playing with the mouse all along.<br /><br />That was the final PPV match for Shawn Michaels for four and a half years. It helped establish Austin as the biggest star in the wrestling business and the mainstream publicity garnered by Tyson\\'s appearance proved a crucial turning point in the WWE\\'s battle with WCW. Austin would go on to become the biggest star in WWE History, and along with the Rock, Mick Foley, the Undertaker and Triple H lead the WWE through the period where they would gain their highest level of cultural relevance.

We are also shown how absurd and paradoxical it is for women not to be allowed to such a nationally important event, meanwhile forgetting the pasts of our respective \"advanced\" nations. I write from Japan, where women merely got the right to vote 60 years ago, and female technical engineers are a recent phenomenon. Pubs in England were once all-male, the business world was totally off-limits for women in America until rather recently, and women in China had their feet bound so they couldn\\'t develop feet strong enough to escape their husbands. Iran is conveniently going through this stage in our time, and we get a good look at how ridiculous we have all looked at one time or another. Back to the issue of sexuality, we are made to wonder what it may be intrinsically about women that make them unfit for a soccer game (the official reason is that the men are bad). Especially such boyish girls, a couple so much so that you even get the feeling that lesbianism is on the agenda as well. I think one point is that not all women are the same, and the women the police are trying to \"protect\" are not the ones who would try to get in in the first place. The opening scenes of the approach to the stadium makes you appreciate the valor of the young women trying to get in -- and each one separately -- at all. It is a brutish man\\'s world. Any woman brave enough to try to go should be allowed! The world of sexuality is not one-size-fits-all.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the apprehended criminal girls bond inside the makeshift pen awaiting their deportation to who-knows-where, and in a much more subtle way, begin to bond with the guards keeping watch over them. These had definite ideas about women and femininity, which were being challenged head-on. The change in attitude is glacial, but visible.<br /><br />Since the movie is pure Iran from the first moment, it takes a little easing-into for the foreigner, but the characters have a special way of endearing themselves to you, and you end up getting the whole picture, and even understanding the men\\'s misunderstandings and give them slack. The supposed villain is the unseen patriarchy of the Ayatollahs, which remain unseen and unnamed, and likely unremembered.<br /><br />Knowing that this movie was filmed during the actual event of the Iran-Bahrain match gives me a feeling of awe for all involved.',\n"," 'This is the first of these \"8 Films To Die For\" collection that I\\'ve seen and it\\'s certainly not made me want to see any of the rest...although I\\'ve heard at least a couple of them are decent.

Your basic dysfunctional cannibal family in suburbia kind of thing, mom & dad died, the family sold the farm & moved to San Francisco (?) where they continued to bring home stray food sources whenever possible.

But, I digress.',\n"," 'Ever since (at least) the eighteenth century, with its cult of the \"noble savage\", tropical islands have frequently been seen in Western culture as the nearest that it is possible to come to Paradise on earth. This view is often reflected in the cinema, in films such as \"The Blue Lagoon\" or the various versions of \"Mutiny on the Bounty\", in which the idyll of Tahiti is contrasted with the rigours of life on board a British warship. The two versions of \"Lord of the Flies\", like the William Golding novel on which they are based, offer an ironic twist on this theme; a tropical island is used as the setting for an anti-Utopian story in which an attempt to found a new society ends in a relapse into barbarism.<br /><br />\"The Beach\" has certain similarities to \"Lord of the Flies\". The main character is Richard, an American backpacker travelling round Thailand, who has heard tales of a co-operative multi-national community of idealistic young people living on a beach on an island off the coast. Richard has dismissed these tales as mere urban legends, but changes his mind when another backpacker, Daffy, gives him a map showing where the mysterious beach can be found. Undeterred by the fact that Daffy commits suicide shortly afterwards, Richard sets out to go there accompanied by Etienne and Francoise, a young French couple whom he has befriended.<br /><br />After a number of adventures, the three succeed in reaching the island and discover that the fabled community is no urban myth but a reality. At first they are welcomed into the group and spend their days leading a seemingly idyllic lifestyle, consisting of a small amount of time spent in fishing and large amounts of time spent in playing volleyball or beach cricket, lazing about smoking pot, or (for some obscure reason) translating various English phrases into Serbo-Croat. As with all films of this type, however, we quickly realise that this life is less perfect than it seems. Sexual tensions arise when Richard finds himself increasingly attracted to Francoise and she deserts her boyfriend Etienne for him. More seriously, there are flaws in the basic concept of the community.<br /><br />The main flaw is that travel narrows the mind wonderfully. The community, mostly Westerners, have dropped out of their own societies and travelled halfway around the world to Thailand, but find Thai society no more congenial than those they have left behind. Their solution is to drop out of that too and to set up a \"beach resort for people who don\\'t like beach resorts\" where they can live their own hedonistic idea of the hippie life. The community is not, however self-sufficient; they produce little for themselves, apart from fish, and have to import many of their supplies from the mainland, which they pay for by growing and selling cannabis. The island, in fact, is owned by a group of Thai farmers, themselves involved in a much larger cannabis-producing operation, who are happy to tolerate the newcomers provided they keep their community a secret and do not try to attract new recruits.<br /><br />As in many anti-Utopian parables, the community is dominated by a sinister dictator-figure. \"Lord of the Flies\" had the choirboy Jack, \"Animal Farm\" had Napoleon and \"The Beach\" has Sal, an upper-class Englishwoman who is accepted as the leader of the community (although it is never clear how she attained this position). Sal is obsessed with protecting the community\\'s privacy and secrecy, and in order to achieve this end she is prepared to resort to violence, even murderous violence. (She is deeply suspicious of Richard, who she suspects may have distributed further copies of Daffy\\'s map). One of the film\\'s most chilling incidents comes after Christo, one of the group, is seriously injured after being attack by a shark. He can only be saved if he is taken back to the mainland for immediate medical treatment, but because this might result in the community\\'s existence being revealed to outsiders, Sal refuses to permit this and Christo is left to die.<br /><br />There is some good acting in the film, especially from Tilda Swinton who gives a nicely judged performance as Sal, a woman with steely eyes and a cut-glass accent who for most of the movie can seem threatening without ever issuing any direct threats or even raising her voice. This increases the impact of the scene at the end where Sal finally does lose her cool. The beautiful Virginie Ledoyen makes a charming and unaffected Francoise, and I also liked Guillaume Canet as Etienne. Originally seen as a loser, the man who loses his girlfriend to Richard, Etienne later emerges as the community\\'s voice of conscience, the one man who refuses to abandon the dying Christo.<br /><br />It was, however, unfortunate that the director Danny Boyle, who wanted Ewan McGregor to play Richard, was overruled by the studio, as Leonardo di Caprio, although he is better here than he was in \"Titanic\", tends to overact. The film tends to deteriorate in the second half, with the plot becoming difficult to follow as Richard, alienated from his fellow-members of the group, starts to become mentally unstable. The style of direction was excessively hectic for my tastes, and the sequence where Richard imagines he is a character in a video game was particularly eccentric. Despite its potentially interesting themes, \"The Beach\" falls just short of being a very good film. 7/10',\n"," \"Night Watch is a low budget Russian vampire movie that depicts the eternal battle of good and evil in modern day Moscow. Centuries after a truce between two opposing forces there is a risk that an 'Other' or gifted human (anyone seen Neo?) will tip the balance of power. As with the vampire movie Underworld there are forces that prevent the battle from spilling over into the real world. The Day Watch are vampires assigned to police their brethren who disguise themselves as Adidas tracksuit wearing chavs who drive Audi TTs and aspire to be pop stars (the UK is full of Vampires!). The Night Watch must step in to prevent evil forces from doing harm to innocent humans. The special effects in the movie are decent and one would be forgiven for mistaking the movie as a Hollywood title at times. However, there are other instances when it looks as though the movie is being acted out by a bunch of friends in a warehouse or derelict flat. The cheap grainy feel is likely to be part of the desired Gothic, art house effect so many will however enjoy its raw non glossy appeal. Whilst most sci fi/ horror fans will be instantly attracted to the story there is not a great deal of depth to the plot or characters and there is the strong feeling that you are being set up for sequel. The movie also moves very slowly at times and the surreal action can be confusing. Whilst some would argue that this adds complexity and intrigue it cant really mask the lack of depth in the story line or characters and will not somehow make it more interesting than it really is. The special effects also often seem to be on display rather than interwoven with plot. There is an interesting end to the movie but the film has been dragged out for too long by its conclusion for you to care. Overall an interesting movie that is likely to herald the start of a potentially significant contribution from Russia to the international action genre but as a stand alone entity it is average at best.\",\n"," 'This movie was highly recommended by some folks. i saw it in cinema with my brother and his 2 friends. At the end we were in disgust and regretting our decision to pay extra money and losing one weekend over this. From the start we did not understand what s going on , there was only killing with bullets firing in an unrealistic fashion. Quite a few action sequences were unbelievable carrying no weight. In one final battle cars were coming directly straight Antonio and his 2 buddies they spray bullets over bullets , not a single one hits the while his shot just inside from his guitar case is far more accurate. The whole film was lost during the process of mindless gun fights. I think its successor was way better than it. such movies can only be enjoyed very much teenage and some immature minds who only want to see violence with no proper plot.',\n"," '\"Gespenster\" (2005) forms, together with \"Yella\" (2007), and \"Jerichow\" (2008), the Gespenster-trilogy of director Christian Petzold, doubtless one of the creme-De-la-creme German movie directors of our time.<br /><br />Roughly, \"Gespenster\" tells the story of a French woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a 3 years old child while the mother turned around her head for 1 minute in Berlin - and has never been seen ever. Since then, the mother keeps traveling to Berlin whenever there is a possibility and searches, by aid of time-dilated photography, for girls of the age of approximately the present age of her age. As we hear later in the movie, the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter Marie. However, this time, when she meets Nina, everything comes quite different.<br /><br />The movie does not bring solutions, not even part-solutions, and insofar, it is rather disappointing. We are not getting equipped either in order to decide if the mother is really insane or not, if her actual daughter is still alive or not. Most disappointing is the end. After what we have witnessed in the movie, it is an imposition for the watcher that he is let alone as the auteur leaves Nina alone. The simple walking away symbolizing that nothing has changed, can be a strong effect of dramaturgy (f.ex. in \"Umberto D.\"), but in \"Gespenster\", it is displaced.<br /><br />Since critics have been suggesting Freudian motives in this movie, let me give my own attempt: Why is it that similar persons do not know one another, especially not the persons that another similar person knows? This is quite an insane question, agreed, from the standpoint of Aristotelian logic, according to which the notion of the individual holds. The individual is such a person that does not share any of its defining characteristics with anyone else. So, the Aristotelian answer to my question is: They do not know one another because their similarity is by pure change. Everybody who is not insane, believes that. However, what about the case if these similar persons share other similarities which can hardly be by change, e.g. scarfs on their left under ankle or a heart-shaped birthmark under their right shoulder-blade? This is the metaphysical context out of which this movie is made, although I am not sure whether even the director has realized that. Despite our modern, Aristotelian world, the superstition, conserved in the mythologies of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their individuality, and that individuality, therefore, is not something erratic, but rather diffusional, so that the borders between persons are open, such and similar believes build a strong backbone of irrational-ism despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking - a source of Gespenster of the most interesting kind.',\n"," 'A bit of a preview to The Sixth Sense, the theme treats childhood conflicts with a respectful interest. Not only does the director get virtuoso performances from his juvenile leads, but his pacing, lighting, visuals, humorous one-liners is simply overwhelming in a neophyte. Rewatch the scene where Joseph Cross and his Grandfather are walking outside and the kid eventually cries on Grandfather\\'s chest. Long, complicated scene with changes in emotion, relationships, timing etc...and done in a single cut. Amazing. I appreciate the Oriental Philosophy touch (as in Eastern). While I heard that M. is an Episcopalian, he retains at his core some mysticism which is evident in both movies. Once Cole Seer understands his \"gift\" he stops being a psychotic outcast and starts a new direction in his life. Once Joshua wakes up and accepts his surroundings, he gets his sign and his answers...what is this, Zen/Hindu/Catholic??',\n"," \"I have not read the novel, though I understand that this is somewhat different from it; the fact that I rather enjoyed this, coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre, leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book. Having not read a single word of Austen's writing, I really can't compare this to any of her work. What I can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is clever, witty, and well-delivered, as well as the biggest source of comedy in this. This made me laugh out loud a lot, with perfect British and verbal material. Every acting performance is spot-on, and Paltrow completely nails the role of a kind matchmaker. The characters are well-written, credible and consistent. I did find a couple of them extremely irritating, however, and while I think that at least some of that was meant to be funny, it tended to get repeated excessively, and it honestly wasn't amusing the first time they appeared. The editing and cinematography are marvelous, and everything looks utterly gorgeous. Plot and pacing are great, you're never bored. It does end in a *really* obvious manner, but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer. I can't claim that this did not entertain me, it did from start to finish, and I'd watch it again. There is brief language in this. I recommend this to any fan of romance stories. 7/10\",\n"," 'I first saw this film when I was about seven years old and was completely enchanted by it then but for years was unable to find out what the film was called. now i am twenty one and stumbled upon the film by accident about two weeks ago and bought a copy. although my memory of the film was a little hazy I was in no way disappointed by what I saw. the animation in this film is superb conjuring up an entire world that is so believable and so well animated that you are drawn in to the film by that alone.

Tracey Ullman hammed it up pretty badly, probably to make clear that nobody should take her role seriously. This gets quite annoying after a while.

We feel Golgo's loneliness and Leonard Dawson's hate and his daughter in law's pain.<br /><br />It is the art of the film that really is portrayed amazingly throughout. The scene in which Duke's car speeds along the beach, or when Gold and Silver (Two of the hired mercenaries) attack him in Dawson's office building near the climax of the film are genius. It is the simplicity of the art that shows what needs to be shown and keeps the story linear, instead of making a muzzled storyline as in other action films.<br /><br />This film doesn't try to make itself more than what it is. It knows that it is an action film and uses this as the foundation to work with, instead of making out it is some sort of psychological examination of killers like so many Hollywood films.

But a quick synopsis of what the film does have should dissuade anyone wishing to view a real horror film from watching this wet sock of a movie.<br /><br />Let\\'s start with Ernest Borgnine. Yes, that lovable, teddy-bear of a man who has charmed us in TV\\'s McChale\\'s Navy, and Peckinpah\\'s The Wild Bunch. When we first meet Borgnine\\'s character, he\\'s standing alone on the streets of a ghost town looking every bit the part of a western rancher. But before the film\\'s over we see him dressed in the dark robes of a satanic priest, and in an unflattering spandex costume that makes him come off as an obese hermaphroditic version of Wonder Woman. Several times in the film, roused into a charismatic fever by his Satan-sermons, Ernie ads the final touch: he turns into a goat.<br /><br />Then there\\'s William Shatner. Dressed like an itinerant farm laborer in the most Hee-Hawish straw hat you ever saw, he shows up with a .45 in one hand and a sacred amulet in another, projecting a \"get behind me, Satan\" attitude. He lasts about five minutes. But in that time he manages to shoot a few of Ernest\\'s goons (which apparently causes them to leak rainbow sherbet), get tied to a cross, branded like a cow, share a passionate kiss -tongue included- with his own mother, and get stuffed into a what looks like an old watermelon full of lost souls.<br /><br />Then Tom Skerrit comes in with his girlfriend and Eddy \\'GGGgrrrreeeeennnn Acres Is The Place To Be!\\' Albert. Together, they cause some more sherbet leaks, then break the watermelon. This does two things. It causes Borgnine to to yell, \"SEIZE THEM!\", which a high priest of Satan has to say at least once in such a movie. It also causes a cold front to inexplicably appear in that little Arizona ghost-town. It rains, and all the Satan-goons melt. Whether they melted because they are Goons-of-Hell deprived of their holy watermelon, or just because they live in Arizona and are unused to precipitation is not explained.<br /><br />The movie ends with Tom Skerrit lovingly embracing, and crying on the shoulder of, Earnest Borgnine. If only Borgnine had been a goat in that scene, the movie would be priceless.',\n"," \"This was a great show about a deeply insecure woman with intense emotional problems.

Watching \"CJ7\" was extremely painful. This film surprisingly evoked nationalistic pride in being an American and having different values. This is not the \"E.T.\" feel good movie nor is it an interesting and beautiful, gut-wrenching movie like the Swedish movie \"My Life as a Dog\", although it had tried many attempts to redeem itself. The characters are mean and self-serving, promoting the value of \"being useful\" over common sense logic such as \"self reliance\". <br /><br />***WARNING!!!***SPOILER ALERT***DETAILS OF MOVIE BELOW*** CJ7 starts out with a very sad tale of a mother-less child who lives in a dump with his father who is a construction worker. The father spends his hard earned money on a private school that he can\\'t afford and forgoes basic necessities such as food, shelter, and clothing so his son can go to this school and have the opportunity to learn. The father never studied in school and constantly reminds his son that they are poor because he is uneducated and can\\'t get a better job.<br /><br />The son, Dickey, is ridiculed at school because he comes to school dirty, his shoes and school uniform is from the dumpster, and it is obvious that he is poor. Nonetheless, like all humans, we all yearn to be accepted.<br /><br />One day, the child who bullies Dickey, comes to school with a very cool toy, a robotic dog named \"CJ\" and evokes jealous from Dickey. Later while Dickey and his father are watching cartoons in a storefront window, Dickey runs off inside to the toy store and screams for the \"CJ\" toy. The father feels awful for spanking the boy to let go of the toy and shame that he cannot buy the toy.<br /><br />Cut to a scene where the father is in the dump looking for better shoes for the boy. In his discoveries, the father runs into a UFO that leaves a nice green ball that the father brings back to Dickie. He claims it\\'s a better toy than CJ.<br /><br />The best scene of this movie is the scene where the green ball is about to hatch and Dickey witnesses the ball hatching and has hallucinations throughout the process. After the hatching, Dickey then dreams that the friendly, magical alien (who he thinks is a toy with batteries) will create additional magical electronic devices to make him smarter, stronger, better, etc...at school.<br /><br />The reality is that the green alien dog like character cannot do that..instead the dog takes a dump in his hands (is this suppose to be funny?) and then also has exploding diarrhea\\'s out of fear (is this suppose to be funny as well?). Dickey abuses the dog, throws it away in a trash can at school, and then has regrets.<br /><br />The dog only wants to please its master.<br /><br />This is where the senses of culture clashes. As an Asian-American that understands Confucian philosophy, I do no value the class hierarchy that animal must obey men and that the younger generation of men must always blindly obey the older generation without question and without doubt.<br /><br />It is painful to watch the dog (alien or not) to be abused by everyone until the end, when the dog sacrifices it\\'s own life to the elder of the family (the father). In death, the dog revered and respected.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, it is even more painful to watch the son suffer for his father\\'s pride. The father\\'s boss states that his own son goes to public school, why shouldn\\'t Dickey? Dickey is failing and \"cheating\" in school and his father stubbornly wastes his money on the expensive school where Dickey is not learning.

I came in thinking that this was probably going to be the worst movie I had ever seen, and, to my dismay, I was right. Some bad movies, in spite of themselves, actually entertain to a certain extent, and others, like Primitif, make you wonder why you wasted five seconds of your life watching it, let alone the entire 90 minute running time. While watching this movie, I was amazed at how poor every aspect was. The acting, dubbing, and dialogue were all horrible, the camera-work was inept, and the picture quality looked like they shot it in 8MM. The only thing that might have it save face are the extremely limited scenes of action and gore, and the genuine Indonesian rain forest where they filmed. Other than that, it\\'s the usual bad adventure movie with bad actors and prolonged sequences of characters walking through the jungle doing nothing (Jess Franco, anyone?). Ever ready to take advantage of the Italian cannibal craze, Indonesia\\'s lone shot at the genre is a swing and a miss.<br /><br />The whole ordeal opens with meeting our hapless \"heros,\" Tommy, Bobby, and Rita. They want to research primitive tribes, but the one tribe their guide takes them to isn\\'t primitive enough (pff), so they pay him to go deeper in the jungle. They then proceed to get into a raft accident. Rita and Tommy are lost in the woods with another one of their idiot guides, and their \"good\" guide and Tommy meet up later. Rita and Bobby\\'s guide is killed in the usual bad spike trap, and they\\'re then captured by the same cannibal tribe they were looking for and face various \"tortures,\" including the most pathetic attempted rape ever committed to film (although there was one noteworthy scene of a cannibal gets his testicles smashed with a mallet). Cut to following Tommy, who is as pathetic as he looks. He eats hallucinatory apples and watches a cannibal give birth and follows her to the tribe. Rita and Bobby escape by being quiet and tip-toeing out of the village, and then find Tommy. They escape, and are confronted again by the cannibals. Robert fights them off single-handedly with lame kung-foo while the other two high-tale it out of there. Poor Tommy is killed, and I cried at that part not because it was so sad, but it was the most unrealistic and sappiest moment in movie history. The other two make it out on a raft with his body, and escape because the river\\'s the cannibals\\' territory boundary.<br /><br />All the characteristics of a bad adventure movie are present, but instead of being an entertaining bad movie (so bad it\\'s good), it\\'s just flat out boring. From the opening, any horror enthusiast will know the outcome from the get go, and as minorities and non-central characters die off, you realize that you were right. Almost every scene in this movie is taken from Last Cannibal World, but they copy them poorly. The biggest problems are probably the most laughable displays and scenes shown throughout the movie. Such displays include rubber snakes attacks, pointless animal combat scenes (only put in to add a cannibal genre legitimacy to it), poor special effects, and the most ridiculous turn of events, such as sawing through the cage with a rock and tip-toeing around the entire tribe to escape. Horrible! All of this helps add to the bland movie atmosphere, and it\\'s not helped by the Flintstones-like music playing all the while. The most annoying thing though was the cannibal tribe. Every cannibal in the tribe all chant the same noise constantly (as if making that noise and bouncing is a ritual). Miraculously, though they all say the same thing all the time, they all understand each other. After watching ten minutes where the only thing on the soundtrack is that chanting and the screechy, whiny screams of the \"victims\" gets old really fast. The wardrobe and makeup was terrible, and the only gore effects that are good are the real animal killings (horribly out of line, with an orangutan having its head broken open), which are only there to make the movie seem as hardcore as the Italians\\' movies. To add to that, the infamous tomahawk-boomerang scene has to be the most hilariously stupid scene in movie history. <br /><br />The only thing I can note about Primitif is that the cannibal tribe at the very least looked realistic, dirty, and gritty, unlike several other cannibal obscurities. However, everything else in the picture tears that positive note apart. Why anyone would pool their money to make this is beyond me. The acting would come better from a kindergarten music class, which doesn\\'t help the ridiculous events, and the audio and visual elements are scratchy and inept. Yes, controversial animal killings are present, mainly to add shock to an incredibly shockless film, thinly disguised as rituals by the tribe. If there are any \"good\" parts to the movie, it was probably taken from other movies. Even cannibal completionists would be hard pressed to consider wasting the money for this movie, especially that there is almost no single feature release still in existence. If you can sit through it, even though I don\\'t even recommend putting it in the player, feel free to experience the most boring 90 minutes or so of your life, and hate yourself for never being able to have them back.',\n"," 'SO THIS IS where Columbia\\'s head of their Short Subjects Unit got his Directorial start, eh? Yeah,it\\'s none other than Mr. Jules White who is credited (or is it rather, \"exposed\") as the Director of this entry into MGM\\'s DOGVILLE Series. Given co-credit as co-Director is one Zion Myers; whose name is heretofore unknown to us. Mr. Meyers was, no doubt, the guy who controlled the four-legged thespians and was responsible for training and \"acting\". In short, he must have been the Dog Trainer on the set.<br /><br />THE TITLE OF this comedy short is no doubt a play on the MGM feature of the same year, THE BIG HOUSE; which starred Chester Morris, Wallace Beery, Robert Montgomery and a stellar cast in support. We must plead ignorance in regards to this title; not having seen it up to this point. (Sorry,Schultz!) But there are many of the doggie gags that relate to what we\\'ve read about the movie*; not to mention some particular character specific gags. For example, we observed a canine convict who st-st-stuttered and deduced,correctly, that the bow-wow actor was mimicking character comedian, Roscoe Ates. We later cross-checked with the cast of THE BIG HOUSE and presto, his name is there! (Brilliant deduction, one fit for Holmes & Watson!) <br /><br />THE PRACTICE OF lampooning popular features was already a tried and true practice in the realm of the comedy short. It was one that seemed to draw no objections from the producers and copyright owners of the major films; but rather quite contrarily received heaps of tassive approval. After all, imitation is said to be the sincerest form of flattery; besides, any producer would welcome even some seemingly irreverent parodying.** AS FOR THE movie, itself, we found it to be interesting in a sort of perverse manner. Seeing so many of \"Man\\'s Best Friends\" being so artificially animated into one, long and boring sort of anthropomorphic gag seemed very tiring to we, who make up the audience. I mean just how many pooches were made to bark, needlessly, in order to achieve the illusion of \\'talking\\'? <br /><br />WHEN IT COMES to pets, or \"Animal Companions\" as the Politically Correct crowd prefers, we are quite eclectic; favoring not only dogs; but also cats, hamsters and parakeets. We don\\'t enjoy seeing any animal exploited in such a non-funny,extended play format.<br /><br />AS INCREDIBLE AS it may seem, the step that Mr. Jules White made from MGM\\'s Shorts to heading up Columbia\\'s 2 Reeler production would seem to have been not only a $tep up in the area of finance$; but al$o in the Arti$tic Content. We never thought that being Producer-Director for the likes of such luminaries as the 3 Stooges, Andy Clyde and Hugh Herbert, as well as some who certainly had seen better days, such as Charley Chase, Buster Keaton and Harry Langdon; would be a step up cinematically.<br /><br />IN CASE WE haven\\'t made our point yet; we\\'re officially panning this one. So, view it at your own risk. We warned you! <br /><br />NOTE * We read excellent accounts of both THE BIG HOUSE and the Laurel & Hardy send-up, PARDON US (Hal Roach/MGM, 1931) in both MR. LAUREL & MR. HARDY by John McCabe (1962) and THE FILMS OF LAUREL & HARDY by William K. Everson (1967). Both books have our most enthusiastic endorsement.<br /><br />NOTE ** The Prison Picture became a Genre of its own; all owing a debt to THE BIG HOUSE.

He ends up ruining the film. Honestly, it's not that great of a script (big fat slob who has good looking girlfriend who wants him to get a real job, etc., etc..), but with a halfway decent actor, it might have been OK. But with Lange, it's complete garbage.<br /><br />I had only heard of Artie Lange after a friend of mine sent me a clip of him at a Comedy Central roast of William Shatner. Artie Lange said at the roast that Lisa Lampinelli was seven bad movies away from being Janeane Garofalo (he also called Ms. Garofalo a f***ing c***, which shows you his maturity level). Well, Janeane has made some bad films, but nothing she's made compares to this garbage, and Janeane has tons of screen presence and is usually the best thing in the films she does.

The problem with it is that it intentionally castigates two of director Richard Fleisher\\'s favorite enemies: Arabs and Germans.

If you read the plot outline, \"a psychotherapist journeys inside a comatose serial killer in the hopes of saving his latest victim\", you might think it\\'s a thriller with a touch of science fiction. But that doesn\\'t really do this movie justice. There is a fantasy aspect within the sub-conscious minds that is stunning, with lavish visuals and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. There is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing. And there is most definitely a horror facet due to the sickening actions of the serial killer\\'s evil persona. The movie attempts to function on many different levels and crosses genre boundaries at will. While I feel it ends up being a reasonably bizarre experience, I find it to be completely fascinating.<br /><br />Right from the opening credits, with Lopez riding a horse through the desert stunningly clothed in a white dress, you will know that you are in for a visual treat. Every time the audience leaves reality and follows her into the sub conscious depths of her \"patients\", they are guaranteed a feast of visual and aural delight. The costumes are wonderful creations of angles and colour. The camera leaves regularities at the door and traverses a world where up and down are the same. The characters become rulers of their own domains and transform into creatures worthy of such stature. If you don\\'t enjoy anything else about \"The Cell\", you will surely be impressed with the work put into these scenes.<br /><br />The casting is top notch also. Jennifer Lopez is in her element here, utilizing her natural, compassionate and almost maternal sensibilities, while combining her own striking looks with the lush surroundings, makeup and costumes. She is incredibly sexy and I personally wish someone would find another role for her outside of the rom-com world she has been typecast into that would allow her to experiment further. Vince Vaughn is fairly convincing as an FBI agent that will do anything to save the life of a young woman. But it is without a doubt Vincent D\\'Onofrio that has the biggest impression here. It\\'s an extremely difficult role as he is required to bring out multiple emotions within the viewer. We are disgusted at his actions, yet sympathetic towards him due to the trauma he has experienced during his life. He looks magnificently powerful within his realm, yet insecure and vulnerable within the real world. It\\'s a great performance from an underrated actor.<br /><br />While \"The Cell\" doesn\\'t work as well on every level it ambitiously attempts (some of the actions of the characters are not believable) and while it is all based on some fairly flimsy scientific logic, it is an occasionally shocking, visually astounding head trip that rewards multiple viewings.',\n"," \"Haines is excellent as the brash cadet who thinks West Point will really amount to something now that he has arrived.

He bemoans this by scolding the portrait he had apparently painted of the man earlier on and then getting drunk and angry in a bar, tossing out patrons. Then he supposedly runs into his girl later on, unrecognized by her, with her and her growing family. This film is notable for a couple of reasons. The first is it's one of Chaplin's first films where he plays a relatively straight role throughout the film, and the second reason is it contains perhaps his first real attempt at pathos in his films: He draws a smiley face on the bar room floor of the girl who left him. However, the print I saw had the scene of Chaplin bumping into his girl's family reversed with his scene in the bar. This is the second Chaplin film I've seen where restoration has failed by changing the editing, like this, or reversing the images. *1/2 of 4 stars.\",\n"," \"This film, as a whole, is poor. Things begin well enough, though, with two brothers meandering through life. They like to steal cars, get high, and ask each other pointless questions, some of which are actually funny. Their world is in shambles. They have no friends, their hometown is a dump, and their family is a rather pathetic lot, even if they're presented in a positive light. All of this makes the brothers' oblivion to the world somehow attractive. The other characters in the film are equally ridiculous - corrupt cops, karaoke nuts, and vulgar nouveau riche types. It's fun to laugh when the brothers' pranks catch these folks off guard.<br /><br />However, the film takes an ugly, brutal, and somewhat sadistic turn. Jokes develop into murder, and comedic situations into depictions of suffering. In principle, I don't have anything against murder or violence in films, but these elements spoiled this particular film. In addition, only a small percentage of the jokes are funny to begin with, and you must have a very discerning ear to sift through the strong Welsh accent. The box cover bragged of a tie to Trainspotting (I can't remember how).

It\\'s hard to believe that stardom beckoned Joan Crawford less than a year after this film was made, as she looks rather awkward at times. <br /><br />I would apply the comment made by another concerning Ramon Novarro\\'s \"Huddle\" (1932) to this film as well. There is a great film waiting to be made here, but there is something lacking. The backdrop and integration of the Corps was well utilized, but I was less involved than I thought that I would be. Perhaps Haines\\' character went too far, or got away with too much. His \"repentance\" did not seem genuine enough; and what kind of message did it send for him to run every play in the last minutes of the Army-Navy game? Where\\'s \"the Corps\" in that? Might as well have taken out the other ten men and let him do it all himself. Also, I doubt very much that William Bakewell\\'s weak, puny character would ever have a real-life counterpart at West Point.<br /><br />All this aside, the film is sometimes very moving and inspiring. It is a fine look into the daily practices of an honorable institution. Thank goodness that tradition still means something at West Point too, unlike the vapid \"traditions\" of Ivy League schools, only half-heartedly engaged in these days.<br /><br />As to the score: it was appropriately martial. But, there was a distinct over-use of snare drums. Using them for knocks on the door, scene transitions, et ALU as well as in well over half the scenes got to be rather tedious. It rather lessened the viewing experience. I was ready to say \"I GET THE POINT ALREADY.\" <br /><br />With that, enjoy the film, but don\\'t expect too much emotional involvement.',\n"," \"Even for sci-fi this movie is movie is a little out there. Alright, more than a little... My first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind.<br /><br />Don't watch this movie expecting another Darko. Darko fans are never going to like another Richard Kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards. Donnie Darko is a thing of the past, get over it.<br /><br />Richard Kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the 'Deeper meaning' the first time you watch them. To be honest I had to watch The Box twice before I liked it. <br /><br />The deeper meaning- (to spare you a bunch of sociological psycho babble) Humans are self serving, we make decisions that can destroy our lives and don't open mail without a return address.<br /><br />Summary: Creepy old man tells Cammeron Diaz if you push the button i will kill someone you don't know and give you a million bucks. Of course she pushes it and as promised by the creepy old gets a case of money. Then the movie takes a dive into the unusual. To spare my fingers the typing... For pushing the button, Diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural alien beings, in an elaborate experiment to gage the morality of the human race.<br /><br />I liked: The willingness of the movie to ignore the generic movie guidelines. Its different. Its intense. It has a deeper meaning (although its philosophy 101 material). It leaves you guessing. NOT A Hollywood ENDING!<br /><br />I disliked: Why would any being with the technology to inhibit another life form devise such a ridiculous scheme? What god like alien has the patience for that? Diaz was good, but was there a need for the country accent? They live in Virginia. <br /><br />I give it a 7 because Kelly didn't put as much attention to detail as with his other movies. Overall good flick.\",\n"," \"This is one of may all-time favourite films.

It absolutely inundates the emotions through a very broad spectrum. Jonathan Safran Foer is played with candor by Elijah Wood. He is in search of his paternal heritage in the Ukraine. His travels bring him in contact with Alex, played very well and with extreme humor by Eugene Hutz. His grandfather is the most emotional tie to this film and he is aptly portrayed by Boris Leskin. If one finds little humor in the human characters in this cinema, then one has only to turn to Mikke, a real dog who is called Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. by Alex and his grandfather.

It is a film worth the time and emotional investment.',\n"," \"This documentary film is based on incomplete considerations of the evidence, in which Brian Flemming, perhaps purposely, fails to mention important evidence to the contrary. Perhaps his most crucial mistake is one of the earliest: His claims concerning the invalidity of Paul's testimony about Jesus Christ disregard key facts, like: **The existence of some formulated creeds within Paul's letters. These creeds suggest that most of the central claims about Jesus were already formulated into statements of faith possibly within a few years of Christ's death and resurrection. **The testimonies of the early Christians can't just be tossed out as mere fantasy. There were indeed many people claiming to be the Messiah during that period, but only ONE of them has remained: Jesus. Why? Because it would have been preposterous for anyone to have actually believed Christ was the messiah, and go on to die for those beliefs, if they knew that he had not been resurrected. **Even if the Gospels are dated more liberally, we are still talking about accounts of Jesus written within the lifetimes of other eyewitnesses that would have pointed out inaccuracies in these Gospels. And there is evidence that the Gospels were written much earlier. <br /><br />What I am saying is that Flemming's documentary is an incredibly biased and self-serving piece of work that hodge podges different arguments and evidence to serve his anti-Christian view. Don't be fooled by poor investigation.\",\n"," 'The movie was well filmed, on a great location, with fantastic backdrops, and is Mel Gibson accurate on all accounts? No, but directors and cinematographers must make changes and put in their montages what they see as a visual story.<br /><br />A small tribe being abducted to be sacrificed did indeed happen in the time of the film 1517 & 1518 the Post Classical Maya period. Even though it was the Aztecs who were the strongest in the time portrayed by the film, \"they \\'the Mayas\\' were close allies of the Aztecs, they shared ideas and religion; and there were trade routes throughout Mesoamerica.\\' (Adams,1998)<br /><br />Were there all kinds of sacrifices going on? Yes, the Mesoamericans were going through all kinds of bad prophecies, such as the hundred year drought and there had been very little rain for the crops. People were starving, the moon ate the sun, and wild animals were attacking the villagers more and more. Since the Europeans had already landed in the Antilles and had already ventured into the Yucatan coast; there was an epidemic of measles and chicken pox that were heavily affecting the American Indigenous, who had no resistance for such diseases (the little girl in the movie). These were all signs that the gods were displeased.<br /><br />For the Aztecs, Mayas and Incas blood was life. It was the flow of life, the liquid that provided life for them, and for the gods as well; and if the gods did not get enough blood the gods were unhappy. So the Aztecs and Mayas were sacrificing at an alarming rate trying to please the gods. This was unfortunate for the villages and tribes in and around the Aztec and Mayan major cities. Since the sacrifices had depleted the population in the larger cities (they could only sacrifice so many of their city people without creating chaos within the city) and most of the citizens and families had already donated a child or an adult male or female to the gods. Worriers were ordered to go outside the larger cities and abduct by force several individuals (young, old, women, and children) from the surrounding villages and tribes. The Spaniards were very much astonished when they witnessed their first human sacrifice, talk about cultural clash.<br /><br />Most of the surrounding villagers did not want to partake in the sacrifices and several of the small villages had already donated a number of their kinfolks to the city leaders for sacrifices. Hence the bloody mess at the temples throughout Mexico in those times was horrendous, \"approximately 40,000 individuals had been sacrificed in one year in Teotihuacan alone\" (Adams, 1998). Imagine about 100 sacrifices per day.<br /><br />This is why Cortés had no problem recruiting 50,000 to 100,000 Indigenous fighters to help his 400 Spaniard eventually defeat the Aztecs.<br /><br />The thrill of seeing a young father and proud tribesmen going to save his wife and children is what movies are made of. The setting in the jungle, the animals, the danger, the trill of victory are all in this film, and even better because of the Mayan background.<br /><br />See it, let the true or untrue facts rest (were the Mayans savages or not?), and the movie is no more gory or graphic than the video games our children here in the USA play.',\n"," 'An excellent movie where everything is beautiful - from the crumbling, claustrophobic backdrops of the antagonists\\' hiding places, the actors and the background music.<br /><br />Besides showing an unusual homosexual relationship, the film also questions the relationship between sex, love and violence - even when the main characters turn \"straight\" violence and death hang in the air, with scenes sex often interspliced with those of death and agony.<br /><br />More importantly, you can\\'t help but feel sorry - and yet almost envious - for the doomed (and did I mention beautiful?) lovers as they slide towards their inevitable end, just for the incredible passion they have for each other.',\n"," \"Not really sure what to say about this one, aside from I didn't like it much.

they ate three square meals a day? why were the germans portrayed as if they came from an episode of 'hogans hero's'? on and on.. if anyone noticed, this film relied on two major sets where at least 80% of action occured. the first half was set around the town square. then to make an allegory of the second half, we have the concentration camp square. forget other smart semiotics such as analogy

site only after seeing the credits at the end. i had flipped-on the record button, and so was able to count the number of stunt performers in this picture -- count\\'em -- sixty-five (65)! frankly, i had not heard of gary daniels until this flick. part of the fun of doing these comments (for me it is great relaxation therapy), is sometimes reading the other comments as you are doing yours. i see several from obvious daniels aficionados, and some with criticism of the acting. \"sol\" from brooklyn had an enjoyable comment to read (and i\\'d guess someone named sol, from brooklyn, ought to have some degree of affinity and familiarity with this genre), and others noted daniels\\' less-than-di nero- or -pacino- level of acting talent -- but these do not diminish the superior action elements of the story. daniels\\' obviously prodigious abilities in the martial arts make his level of activity in dispatching the bad guys very believable (even though the extent, circumstances and numbers of adversaries involved may stretch this believability a tad). i got into the film just as the several policeman, who were involved in the bust where the don\\'s son was killed, were being debriefed. so i missed the initial car chase referenced by others, but there were certainly more to come, in quantity, in this presentation. regarding references to daniels\\' acting - i have commented about patrick swayze, referencing leonard maltin\\'s depicting swayze\\'s acting range as \"from a to b.\" it\\'s possible daniels\\' range could be considered \"from a to a-minus.\" also, the histrionics of the don\\'s wife were on the \"spears\" or \"madonna\" level, as described elsewhere here. even sollozzo, the drug dealer who had the nerve to attempt to whack don corleone in \"the godfather,\" or the always rash bugsy siegel, would hesitate to initiate the extreme level of carnage the crime boss revengefully ordered in this picture. but that was what set the tone, and this still was fun to view. and the car chase scenes obviously were either bereft of a lot of computerized enhancements, or were so artfully-added as to be undetectable. they were on a level of those in big-budget films we remember, involving gene hackman, steve mcqueen, clint eastwood, etc.',\n"," 'spoiler alert! this is one of the finest satiric cartoons ever made. i am convinced that south park is the best show on tv (and the only excuse to turn on that disgusting comedy central [aka the beer and sex channel,]) but some people wonder if the movie is as good as the show. take my word for it, it is not. it\\'s ten times better. in the movie, stan, kyle, cartman, and kenny see an r-rated film starring their favorite canadian actors, terrance and philip. the movie is entitled asses of fire, and if i may quote arthur taussig, the title is the least offensive thing about it. in the opening scene of asses of fire, we discover why it was rated r. i will not give away one of the funniest parts of the movie, but i\\'ll just say that i did not know you could use that many obscenities in only three minutes. when the movie ends, the boys leave the theatre repeating all the words they have heard in the film. not knowing what the words mean, they continue this behavior the next day at school. their teacher sends them to the guidance counselor who subsequently calls their mothers. as those who watch the show may have guessed, sheila brosfloski, kyle\\'s mother, is outraged and begins a campaign to have the film banned. it\\'s general pop-culture knowledge that kenny mccormick is killed in nearly every episode of south park. one can naturally assume that his death in the movie would be the kenny-death-to-end-all-kenny-deaths. it is, but unlike his frequent deaths in the show, his death in the movie is a huge contributing factor to the plot. this may be a slight spoiler (if you can call the way in which kenny dies a spoiler.) the boys end up seeing the movie again, and kenny is killed while imitating something he saw in the film that may be too inappropriate say in this review. he is banished to hell for skipping church to see the film, and we discover that satan and saddam hussein are in a homosexual love affair. in this relationship, satan is surprisingly warm and caring and wants to communicate with saddam, but saddam just wants sex. the conversations between these two characters throughout the film are hilarious. meanwhile, back on earth, sheila brosfloski\\'s movement to have terrance and philip banned has spun out of control. canada is blamed for all of the problems of america\\'s youth, america is preparing to literally wage war against canada, all canadian-american citizens are sent to death-camps, and terrance and philip are scheduled to be executed. back in hell, kenny listens to a conversation between satan and saddam. bible readers know the seven signs of the end of the world. the fall of an empire, the coming of a comet, etc. we discover that when the blood of terrance and philip touches american soil, satan and saddam hussein will ascend from hell and rule the earth. it is now up to stan, kyle, and cartman to save humanity from the horrors of every christian\\'s worst nightmare, and his boyfriend, george w. bush\\'s worst nightmare. this film is more than hilarious. i am convinced that matt stone and trey parker are the funniest individuals in america. this film is an animated musical, but parents beware, it does not bare the disney family-friendly stamp of approval. the best songs in the film are \"up there,\" \"i am super,\" \"what would brian boitano do?,\" and the infamous \"blame canada,\" which was nominated for an oscar. the best voice jobs by the creators were saddam hussein (matt stone,) and satan (trey parker.) i could watch this film twenty times every day and never tire of it. caution: while this film is animated, it is certainly not for the kiddies. it is filled with vulgar language, but it is not gratuitous. the language used is the purpose of the film. the moral of the film is that no matter what words your children learn from a film, it is not the filmmaker\\'s job to raise your child. it\\'s an anti-censorship film. it is the up to the parent to put it into context and punish accordingly. i would recommend this film to everyone who is not easily offended or an extreme christian, you will be offended. if you are into satirical cartoons, or just want to see canadians drop bombs on alec baldwin, south park: bigger, longer, and uncut is a must-see.',\n"," 'its a shame that this sitcom gem was lost to us due to constant preempting. i have never thought the rating system was all that fair. they should not include moments when prime time shows fall victim to breaking world newscasts, presidential addresses, special mini-series broadcasts, and holiday specials... its just not an accurate assessment of a show\\'s viewer base. that said, maybe some reviewers are right that the audience was not \\'there\\' yet, as the d&d gaming crowd was still mostly a little young to fall into the demographic they were shooting for... but i certainly loved it! and pay no heed to the comments of \\'oh dear, oh dear\\'... that person obviously had no idea that the show was not there as a serious attempt to promote d&d to the masses... it was a comedy... a silly, camped-up comedy

of role as stephanie on the \\'newhart\\', for the first season she was on that show i just saw her as the princess... and that alone kept me watching \\'newhart\\'! i was never much a jeff conway fan, but the show gave me a better appreciation for him. and the villain stole the scene (or at least what part of it he could pry away from duffy) every time he took the screen. i always thought his name was derek blackpool.. to me that seems funnier somehow than dirk (maybe because it rhymes with eric?). perhaps after a couple of decades of having seen it, its like dark shadows... you remember it as scarier (or in this case, funnier) than it actually was (and we\\'ll sadly never know now how good it could have been), but i would love to go back and watch it again. i do not recall if it had a laugh track, but i do not think it would have needed one if it is indeed as funny as i recall. i was sad to see it go, and like another poster, did not realize it was gone until it did not come

assignation; his youngest, daughter christina (hayden panettiere, currently on nbc\\'s hit series \"heroes\" as the cheerleader impervious to pain), whose blossoming into young womanhood is proving to be a painful event; and his wife julia (isabella rossellini), a homemaker whose anal retentive disposition is masquerading some still waters running deep. to add further complication, enter tonya

elicits leo\\'s help by forcing him to sign her petition, figuring his name will get the civic wheels in motion. leo naturally declines, since his ego in check will not recognize that this is the blame for the building\\'s plague of problems (i.e. drug dealing on the premises and general vandalism). but that will not stop tonya\\'s quest for closure. based on a play by david greig, a scottish playwright, novice director matt tauber (a fellow american playwright and film producer making his debut here), adapts with a leaden storyline that mars a genuine plot point: how does housing truly affect its populace. he instead sets up one unlikely premise (martin suddenly having a gay encounter; christina lamely seducing a truck driver; julia going off her nut, et al) that serves no real pay off and loses interest in tonya\\'s plight (it is apparent that she lost one child, while her surviving off- spring are so disparate they may as well be strangers), which should have been the central focus. while the storytelling misses its mark however the acting is on-target. lapaglia, one of my favorite actors, gives a complex yet sublime turn as the slightly arrogant and apparently clueless

rabid cow, so it is fun to have fun, yet the filmmakers did not know how. this film, in short is atrocious. the acting was bad, the plot was tweaked too much, and the humor was surprisingly very crude. it starts with conrad and sally, a rule breaker and a future sheriff. when their mother has to go to work, she gets mrs. kwan to babysit. possibly the lone funny part in the movie is when mrs. kwan is watching a taiwanese court room, a `la c-span. she soon falls asleep, and here comes the cat. the film starts to spiral out of control. the cat came to try to let the kids have some fun. he\\'s got thing 1 and thing 2, who suddenly start trashing the house. he improvises a tv infomercial, and accidentally slices his tail off. and when the cat goes full carmen miranda, it\\'s not

things like \"you dirty ho\" and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after a whack in the testicles while posing as a pinata. spencer breslin is great as the trouble-making conrad,

bonus and charming as usual. the story centers around rufus excalibur (moore); a heavy drinking, confident, cocky and intelligent specialist. he is like the equivalent of an ex-navy seal of some sort. he leads a team that focuses on water dives, stealth and ship recovery tactics. rufus is the best, of course, and expects a lot from his men. he is never satisfied but that is some of the humor as well. rufus also dislikes women, is crazy for cats and has a lot of money. basically a hijack team overtakes a boat and its crew and holds 2 large oil rigs, ruth and jennifer, for ransom via bombs attached to them. rufus is called in to lead the recovery and the story fluctuates between the hijackers and the crew and rufus\\' life, preparation and style. the rest is primarily climactic and the adventure, action and humor all fall into place the last hour of the movie. if you are a roger moore fan, see this movie solely for that. you will be pleasantly surprised. also, see it because it is still a solid movie after 22 years and i still am entertained after 20+ viewings. unfortunately there is no dvd version, but it is for sale and possibly for rent. give it a shot! 10 of 10 mainly

willey, kenneth hunter... directors michael curtiz, william keighley... screenplay norman reilly raine, seton i. miller. released in 1938 in the new technicolor of the time, \"the adventures of robin hood\" was the one film that not only launched the career of actor errol flynn but that of his co-star olivia de havilland as well as director michael curtiz and even elevated warner bros studios to a new level of greatness, simply because this film boasts a strong cast and oozes with grand old hollywood spectacle. the popular folk legend of the heroic outlaw robin hood is an old one, dating back to the time of the medieval crusades and the reign of king richard the lion-hearted. errol flynn brought the familiar character to brilliant life in every detail of his performance; from the physicality of his acting (he did all his own stunts!) to the accurate \"robin hood\" mannerisms, language, accent and even laugh. he was exactly what audiences felt robin hood should be. it\\'s even likely he inspired the later disney animated version of robin hood in the 60\\'s, in which the characters were animals. the story of robin hood has endured over the years because it\\'s at heart a classic tale of heroism. the social outcast robin hood and his band of merry men,despite lacking the comforts of home and titles, save a then feudal england from the corruption of the sheriff of nottingham and the usurper prince john. while righting wrongs, robin hood falls for the noblewoman maid marion. can he defeat the evil prince john and restore the rightful king richard to the throne ? a notable cast heads up the film. rising star olivia de havilland is pretty, elegant, charming and yet very resourceful as maid marian, and her chemistry with robin hood is electrifying. she would later become far more than just errol flynn\\'s leading lady and win two oscars for strong dramatic performances in the 40\\'s for \"to each his own\" and \"the heiress\" and her acting career lasted over 30 years. what we see in her as maid marian is a young olivia de havilland, a new arrival in hollywood. but the rest of the principals were established stars. actor basil rathbone, who plays sir guy of gisbourne, had been a silent film star of swashbuckling adventure films. claude rains (prince john) was popular at this time and would continue to enthrall audiences with great performances over the years, including his memorable films \"the invisable man\" and the \"talkie\" \"phantom of the opera\". claude rains as prince john is a nasty piece of work, blinded by ambition and ruthless in his pursuit of power, hoping to rule england in the absence of king richard (ian hunter) who is portrayed as a lost adventurer himself. having fought in the crusades, he comes home to an england he hardly recognizes and one that does not recognize him. melville cooper portrays the corrupt sheriff of nottingham. the merry men of sherwood forest, including patrick knowles as the dashing will scarlett, alan hale as the burly little john and eugene palette as the godly friar tuck are also what audiences imagined they would be. when the characters are not fighting, plotting or saving the day, there is a considerable amount of humor, especially in such characters as bess, portrayed by una o\\'connor, who serves as lady-in-waiting to maid marion. this film had two directors, michael curtiz and william keighley because during this time in hollywood, the more ambitious, expensive or difficult-to-produce films normally needed extra direction. but it is michael curtiz who garnered fame and he would later direct errol flynn in other successful films such as the elizabethan adventure \"the sea hawk\" and the pre-civil war epic \"santa fe trail\" in which flynn was once again paired with olivia de havilland. this film is a winner and a classic slice of old hollywood.',\n"," 'an absorbing exploration of virtual reality, although it is not yet clear how much the director

confusion for the viewer to ponder. also can be seen as a satire of video games-- the whole movie though may fall into the fallacy of imitative form here. it seems unable to escape from the video game genre which it imitates; thus the satire becomes problematic. a number of interesting ideas crisscross throughout though: the biological mutant is one; the interface of technology and biology, the cyborg urge to transcend reality-- and philosophical allusions such as the title\\'s to heidegger, along with existential questions: i.e., the game characters are partly scripted or determined and yet partly free to alter their fate, and they wonder at how strange that feels in the game. one character then notes that this existential confusion is just like real life, thereby erasing again the distinction between the virtual and the real. likewise with the observation that it is unpleasant to stumble around in a world where you do not know what will happen next and you are not sure how to play since you have to stumble around just to find out the goal and the unknown rules. a virtual game within the game is titled \"transcendenz\". also a critique of how virtual violence makes us unable to feel the effects of real violence. even the heroes at every level of ontological existence find themselves confused about violence. they do not like it but it is thrilling and part of the \"game\", which then they fear is real. the game creator, the god of the system, is assassinated in the end; yet that very scenario is played out in direct parallel to a video game we have just witnessed-- and the onlookers believe that it is still just part of the virtual reality. in the end, the film does not resolve the doubt about whether or not this is \"real\" but the point is clear (to me anyway). existenz means da-sein: you are there. you are thrown into a set of rules and mysteries at every level. ontologically, virtual reality recapitulates reality. and its common game motifs express, like a royal road to the unconscious, our own fascination with violence. nevertheless, while cronenberg affirms these philosophical allusions in an interview about the film, he claims that he is very much against the \"reality... {underground name of terrorist group} portrayed in the film both in the game and in the \\'real\\' level.\" seems that cronenberg himself did not put that much thought into the film, though his impressive education comes through. the interview in cineaste gives the impression of a middle brow intellectual who\\'s trying to be avant-garde by inclination. cronenberg is simply on the side of free imagination -- the clichéd bourgeois modernist credo-- despite the acknowledged ambivalence there. (my impression here might be due to one limited interview.) still, cronenburg seems to miss the point that his film betrays the fallacy of imitative form (here imitating computer games while doing a satirical critique of them, but a critique that is unable to \"transcend\" the same form) probably because he actually thinks that it is \"imaginative\" and radical. yet the film\\'s imaginative world is less bearable, and more jejune, than our own all-too-real world. it remains trapped in the computer game worldview.',\n"," 'i have loved this movie ever since the first time i saw it years ago when i was a preteen. although it is an old movie, it is still quite enjoyable. it was made in 1959 so of course it lacks the newer features which todays movies emit. however, i think the simple, sweet story of first love is a nice escape from the harsh realities of todays world. i always choose movies that provide something i cannot find in real life. i prefer escaping the norm. if i want to see sex and violence all i have to do is watch the news. gidget takes us all back to a simpler time and place where we can relive the memories of our youth or imagine how it might have been. i not only own the video but i also watch it on television whenever it airs. having just finished watching again, i have to say that the idea that bl was a lesbian never entered my mind. they speak about how she has it made cause she wears her boyfriends pin. i always took that to mean that she was involved in a relationship with a guy who just happened to be away at college or working a lot. just cause someone has short hair does not make them a lesbian in my mind and i think the person who made that comment was way off base and did not really follow the conversations of the movie closely. i love

of medical dope but instead of dope there is nothing but sand in the crate. the purser has stolen it, with the complicity of one of the passengers, a miss toni cardell. two treasury agents, scott brady and richard rober, latch on to the case and track the dope through a network of heavies and murderers led by yul brynner. they succeed with the help of the u. s. coast guard and at the cost of brady\\'s life. right away, though, i had a slight problem in that nobody anywhere is named miss toni cardell. it\\'s the kind of echt-schiksa name that somebody might dream up because it sounded right, like \"ellie arroway\" in carl sagan\\'s novel, \"contact.\" but just try to find a name like toni cardell in a phone book, especially in shanghai. i dare you. secondly, the crate carrying the dope is opened by customs agents. it\\'s a big crate, the size of a wardrobe, and it\\'s filled entirely with sand. a reasonable inference is that a lot of dope is missing, yet when the box of narcotics is finally discovered in a locker at grand central station, it\\'s only big enough to contain, say, three dictionaries. those, of course, are minor things. yet this is a minor movie. it\\'s a routine track-\\'em-down mystery with t-men putting themselves in danger by posing as somebody else. scott brady is okay. he\\'s an irishman with burt lancaster\\'s habit of sticking out his jaw in a defiant scowl when he\\'s angry. it\\'s rather likable. his partner, richard rober, on the other hand, has practically nothing to offer, a bland, acceptably handsome contract player. he\\'s the one who should have been knocked off early on, allowing scott brady to continue the chase. best performance, hands down -- yul brynner with hair as the vladimir putin look-alike who heads the whole operation. what a background the guy had. a jew from sakhalin island off the siberian coast, a stint at the sorbonne in paris, a trapeze artist. \"the king and i\" brought him fame but left him socked into a domineering and unsubtle persona. here, he gives his most earnest performance. he\\'s suave, handsome, delicate even. and -- this being 1949, the year when the cold war became an undeniable fact -- his russian accent fits the temporal template. he\\'s better here than he ever was later. but, taken as a whole, what we have here is an inexpensive eagle lion crime drama with self-sacrificing heroes and ruthless villains. nice to see the coast guard in action. even if, to pump up the action, the writers and lazlo benedict, the director, have brynner shooting his snub-nosed

quentin tarantino said once in an interview about personal experience in being a creator of art or acting. he referred to an example of, say, if he ran over a dog while on his way to act in a play that it would not be the end of his life but that it would affect him, and that, without a doubt, he would have to bring that experience with him on stage even if it was a light comedy. \"otherwise,\" as he said, \"what am i doing?\" i could not help but think of his words when watching gena rowland\\'s character, myrtle gordon, who for almost a whole week or so goes through a very similar scenario. there is more to this in cassavetes\\' film, of course, since it\\'s about how the theater works around a star actress, what emotion and human nature mean when looking at playing a character, and how one lives when all one has (like myrtle gordon) is the theater. near the beginning of the film, after exiting a performance, myrtle is signing autographs and one such fan named nancy comes up to her favorite star and pours her heart out to myrtle. it\\'s a touching little moment, but it does not last as she has to get in the car (pouring rain and all). she then watches in horror as the girl, who stood right next to the car as it drove off, gets hit by another car in an auto accident. she\\'s not sure really what happened, but then finds out the next day that in fact the girl did die from the hit. from then on she\\'s sort of stunned by this even after she thinks it\\'s out of her system. at first this shows in small ways, like when she rehearses a scene with her fellow actor (played by cassavetes) and can not seem to stand being hit - she blames it on the lack of depth in the character (the writer: \"what do you think the play lacks?\" \"hope,\" says myrtle)- but then nancy starts to show up to her, an apparition that to myrtle is all to real, until she\\'s suddenly gone. cassavetes, as in the past films, is after a search for what it means to have emotion, to really feel about something and feel it, or the lack thereof, and how it affects others around the person. this is not exactly new ground for rowlands, who previously played a woman on the edge of herself in woman under the influence (in that case because of alcohol), nor would it be alien territory for costar ben gazzara, who just came off starring in killing of a chinese bookie. but the actors express everything essential to their characters in every scene; cassavetes does not tell them how to get from a to b in a scene, and he does not need to. there\\'s a mood in a cassavetes film that trumps the sometimes grungy camera-work. you know myrtle, for example, should be content somehow, even if it is not with the plot. but she\\'s haunted, and is unsatisfied with her character\\'s lack of depth and the tone of the play (\"aging, who goes to see that?\" she asks the playwright), and it starts to affect those around her too. the question soon becomes though not what is the usual. a conventional dramatist would make the conflict \\'will she be able to go on stage, will the show go on?\\' this is not important for cassavetes, even if it\\'s there, as is the question \\'will she be alright?\\' perhaps going through such a grueling play as \"the second woman\" could help her work out her personal demons and her losing her grip on reality (seeing sara and attacking her in front of total strangers, who wonder what the hell is going on)? or will the play\\'s lack of hope strain everything else wrong with her? the depths rowlands makes with her character are intense and harrowing, and that it\\'s expected does not mean it\\'s any duller than woman under the influence- if anything, it\\'s just as good as that film at being honest about a person in this profession, and consequently the other performances are just as true, from gazarra to nancy played by a subtle laura johnson. cassavetes answers to his own posed questions are not easy. one of the real thrills of opening night, along with seeing great actors performing an amazing script, is to see cassavetes take on the theater the way he does. we see the play performed- and it\\'s apparently a real play- and we only know slightly what it\\'s about. when we see the actors on the stage performing it, we wax and wane between being involved in what melodrama is going on (relationship scuffling and affairs and the occasional slap and domestic violence) and the improvisation of the actors. i wondered watching how much really was improvised, how much cassavetes allowed for the other actors to do in the scenes where myrtle starts to go loopy or, in the climax, is completely smashed. he\\'s on the stage, too, so it must have been something for them to work it out beforehand and let what would happen happen. it\\'s funny, startling, chilling, and edge-of-your-seat stuff, some of the best theater-on-film scenes ever put in a movie, and we see the lines between actor on stage, actor on film, actor with actor, blur together wonderfully. opening night is a potent drama that is full of frank talk about death and madness, reality and fiction, where the love is between people, and really, finally, what does \\'acting\\' mean?',\n"," 'apartmente\\'l is one of the most interesting movies that i have ever seen. i experienced extreme frustration while watching this movie as i was gunning for the two leads to reunite. that never happened in the end which disappointed me to no end. but the ending lends an even more cynical touch to a generally cynical movie. it is not a movie which people are likely to rewatch but one watch itself will have a deep impact on people. as of now i have not rewatched the movie and i do not think i will. the story follows the experiences of a man, max, who is engaged to be married to muriel. he remembers his old girlfriend lisa(he considers this the love of his life) as he listens, by accident, to lisa talking on the telephone. thus he tries to find lisa. here starts his extremely frustrating search for lisa. there are many layers to this movie. there are undercurrents of jealousy, vouyeurism and so on. there is also another character called alice who is involved in the whole confusion. the movie then moves through a whole range of twists and finally leads to an ending which could be interpreted in many ways. it is fascinating how this movie has only four main characters but the clever writing makes it interesting and unique. what i love about the fact is that a movie about obsession, jealousy is done in such a light hearted manner. it has a very fast pace which is probably the reason why it can appeal to a large audience. the main character, max, has shades of grey and i felt the ending was perfect. i do not think he is supposed to be a clean character considering the fact he is searching for his long lost love while he is engaged and he also has a fling with alice. the character of alice is even worse. her manipulation and her compulsive lying can really irritate viewers(that is the point, i guess). the scene where she breaks down in front of lucien really shows another facet of her character. it shows a side of her that wants to be accepted and that she is tired of all the lying and the games and she wants to lead a normal life. in the end, she understands that she needs to get away from it all. the ending lends a cynical touch. because it seems as if max\\'s love for alice is temporary and fake. it is as if to say that love in general is a temporary emotion and it is better to choose the safe option(i.e muriel) than to pursue something that is so fleeting(i.e lisa or alice). in many ways this is not really a romantic movie but a satire about romance(in a way). the performances deserve high praise. vincent cassel as max gives a great performance. he perfectly portrays the confusion of a man who is not really sure about his engagement. his geeky looks are an added advantage as it fits the character perfectly. but the real star of the movie is romane bohringer as alice. her nuanced portrayal of a woman who is jealous of alice and is in love with max. the scene where she screams \"i am a nutcase too\" really shows her desperation and her yearning to live a normal life with a man who loves her. btw i also thought lesbianism is another interpretation that can be drawn from this movie. alice\\'s actions can be explained in many ways. and her unreasonable obsession with lisa may also be explained as a manifestation of a lesbian desire. it may be far-fetched considering she encourages lisa to forgive her current boyfriend. but i got the feeling that she was a lesbian for a long time. she also avoids questions from lisa regarding a boyfriend. she spends a whole lot of time with lisa and she is happy during that time. that may lead many to question her sexual orientation. overall i would give it a 9/10. i think it deserves it but i subtracted one because of the rewatchability factor. i think it is a perfect movie otherwise.',\n"," 'by the end of the movie, chad donella is forced to choose between an ex-model with a innocent

titillation, sometimes even missing filmmakers\\' or actors\\' intent. even from footage that reasonable people may argue should never have existed, i always imagine there\\'s something to learn. i wonder more at how a film does than about what it does. maybe that\\'s wrong of me. wiser but harder than deconstructing unpleasant cinema, might be to see cuts, pans, etc., at one with and

sound in order to alter perception and mood. how different are their goals? how different are the goals of those who film real atrocities for use as propaganda? when the original all night long (anl)

sublime horror of kairo, cure, angel dust, lain, the rawer but still traditionally framed horror of the first evil dead trap, the overtly political work of koji wakamatsu, or even the brilliant crudity of early cronenberg. maybe that word \"attack\" is key. matsumura attacks not his characters, but his viewers. i can not watch these at this point in history without thinking of both abu garib (some of which i think i recall was evidenced on video) and the hostage videos, but also about godard\\'s torturers (in le petit soldat?) to whom atrocity is just a job, a fraction of a person\\'s workday. and then there\\'s the prolonged northern california news story whose details i barely remember but can not entirely forget because it too entails \"cinema,\" a duo of serial killers notorious, if suggestion is not playing games with my memory, for having videotaped themselves torturing victims. all three anl entries are revenge cinema, vigilante exercises, but i am attaching these notes anl3 because it\\'s the most ambitious and may constitute a turning point for director matsumura. (i have not seen the entries that followed anl3.) through the first two offerings, i imagined a camera fallen into the hands of one of those fringe kids from middle or grammar school who obsessively draw war scenes or other atrocities. (or as if one of matsumura\\'s revenge-crazed characters had turned writer-director. anyone watching these who has not seen michael powell\\'s peeping tom would do well to see it.) but anl3 seems to aspire to mainstream. matsumura\\'s protagonist grows carnivorous plants, allowing for some typically japanese cool close-up nature shots. there\\'s also, for the first time a matsumura film, a traditionally erotic sequence: kikuo\\'s female boss sneaks up and begins to caress him while he\\'s peeping at the love hotel\\'s customers. kikou finds himself unhappily sandwiched between. he\\'s a middleman voyeur. the brief thrill comes from the layers of voyeurism. there\\'s even a philosophical/poetic garbage sifter, a garbage voyeur who somehow makes me think of the poem repeated in wakamatsu\\'s not-at-all-what-it-sounds-like go, go, secondtime virgin. i am getting nowhere with this, and it\\'s getting in the way of my commenting other films. can not escape the suspicion that a few years on i\\'ll walk into a matsumura retrospective at my local film archive, maybe hosted by some learned character who\\'s caught onto something i am missing. how much does it matter whether the director is or simply \"gets\" his lethally muddled protagonists? does he even have to understand them? maybe a director\\'s job is just to spew it out, then let critics, sociologists, and the rest of

wise versa, which \"aristocats\" certainly shows. the characters make the film; they are all likable, fun, have great lines and have a great interaction with each other. the voice actors are also a part for making the characters so compelling (eva gabor as duchess, phil harris as thomas o\\'malley and etc). a misconception could have been the dogs napoleon and lafayette, since they are showstoppers and have not so much to do with the actual story, but fortunately they are fun and amusing characters and the scenes with them are pure gold. \"aristocats\" is both entertaining and cute, but it\\'s also a very funny cartoon. the animation style and look fits perfectly for the film\\'s french surroundings (especially the city of paris looks greats). the character animation and design is great. and the songs are really catchy too. my favorite is \"scale and arpeggios\", but the title song is a cute song, along with \"thomas o\\'malley cat\" and the memorable show-stopper \"everybody want\\'s to be a cat\". and the score by george burns is a perfect fit for the film funny and emotional situations. overall, \"aristocats\" is in my opinion the best disney cartoon from the 70\\'s and it\\'s a film that deserves to both be seen and remembered. so what you are waiting for? do your self a favor and share this disney classic with your kids. it deserves to be in their

offers an insightful look into the political situation of el salvador during the 1970\\'s. like many countries of latin america at the time, the nation was ruled by a brutal regime run largely by the military. political assassinations and repression of all kinds were common place. the working people of el salvador were also forced to endure the hardships of poverty and economic instability. the film is interesting to watch because it shows the controversy over the difficult roles that many in the catholic church felt compelled to play in the midst of the situation. according to the film, many in the catholic church, including many priests and eventually the archbishop himself, saw the political and economic situation in el salvador as terribly unjust. several priests began to speak out publicly on behalf of the people suffering in their congregations. this kind of political activism agitated the military regime and resulted in a crackdown on elements within the church including the assassination and repression of activist priests. as a result of this persecution, the newly appointed archbishop of san salvador was forced to become more involved in the situation. as the political repression and injustice continued, the reluctant oscar romero began to speak more publicly on his opposition to the government and its policies. the film offers a remarkable insight into the political and cultural situation of the country. at the same time, the film documents the life and struggles of oscar romero during his tenure as archbishop of san salvador. much of the film\\'s drama is centered on romero\\'s reluctance to get involved in the political debate that was engulfing his country. in fact, the film focuses as much on the character\\'s personal transformation as it does on his politics. according to the film, when romero was instated as archbishop it was only because he was viewed as an intellectual moderate who would keep the church from getting too involved in the political affairs of the country. as the film progresses, however, the political repression becomes increasingly violent. with the assassination of a priest and the military\\'s desecration of the eucharist in a catholic church, oscar romero was shaken into action. he frequently began to speak publicly against the injustices of the political regime. it was interesting to watch romero increasingly identify himself with the suffering of the people of el salvador. at the beginning of the film, romero was shown to have a close relationship with several of the wealthy elites that were controlling the country. many of the military and political leaders attended his inauguration. he received gifts from them and enjoyed a close relationship with several powerful figures in san salvador. as the film progressed, however, these relationships quickly began to deteriorate. as romero increasingly identified with the suffering and persecuted people of el salvador, his relationship with the ruling elites also began to suffer. in a particular scene, romero declined to perform a private baptism for the child of a wealthy family. instead, romero told the family that they must baptize their child alongside all the other children at a regular sunday mass. the wealthy mother was horrified at the thought. it was this way that romero increasingly began to identify himself with the lower-class people. in another scene, romero is seen speaking on the radio about the church\\'s need to defend the needs of the poor and underprivileged in society. it was this kind of \"radical\" thinking that earned romero enemies within the government. eventually romero\\'s \"agitations\" became too much for the military-backed government to bear. the film does not say if it was the government or simply an overzealous supporter of the military-regime, but romero was eventually assassinated for speaking out in support of the poverty-stricken masses of his country. regarded as supporting communist subversives, the military leaders began to view the archbishop as a threat to their grip on power. the film ends with the dramatic assassination in which romero was gunned down in the church while performing the communion ceremony for his congregation. at the end of the film, the text stated that in the nine years following the assassination or archbishop romero, more than sixty-thousand salvadorians were killed under the military regime. to me, this film demonstrates the tragic brutality of many of the latin american military regimes that emerged in the late 20th century. after viewing this film, i have a newfound respect for the person and philosophy of oscar romero.',\n"," \"i have not read the novel this film was based on, but i did recently watch the 1980 version. while the modern version has better production values, sets, costumes, etc. i have to say that i favor the 1980 version. both films are less than forthcoming with what is going on, but at least the 1980 version attempted to tell a complete story. (spoilers follow.) where were the aliens? where was the mention that there was nuclear war in april 1998? where was the confrontation between haber and orr? having read a bit about the novel and having watched the interview with leguin, i know that the 1980 version was more faithful to the source material, and for that (as well as better performances from the two male leads) i have to recommend that version over a&e's reader's digest version.\",\n"," 'the first home alone was a decent enough film... the sequel was pretty much the same, at a new setting. this one tries to be original, and succeeds to some degree... of course, the formula is basically the same, so it\\'s like watching the same movie for a third time with slightly altered plot. the new score is quite bad(though the new \"setting traps\" piece was, if nothing else, interesting and different), especially compared to the grand score of the first, and the almost-but-not-quite-as-good score of the second. it (almost) makes up for it by using some pretty good non-original music, but it\\'s just not the same. the plot is fair, and somewhat original to the franchise, but it\\'s still basically the same movie as the first two, with worse acting and a less impressive example of the \\'scary character turning out to be good\\'. the acting is mostly unimpressive. the characters are mostly caricatures. the new thieves are less entertaining than the old ones(and they make fun of spy-stuff, which is almost criminal, given the limited amount of good spy flicks there are, and how precious few of them are cool). the fact that there are more of them(and thereby more traps) is just a weak attempt at trying to go one higher than the first two films... and it does not work. the idea behind the thieves and their mission is a tad too... adult and serious for a children\\'s film(and there was a sexual joke or two, though that is not the first time in the series). it\\'s also unnecessarily complex, as is the plot in general. i could follow it, but i doubt a kid could. some of the exposition are delivered so obviously that even children may find it stupid. the animal stuff is generally not amusing. there are fewer siblings, which should mean that those there are get developed more, but they have less personality than the least featured of those of the first two films. all in all, just not particularly good, or worth watching, unless you *really* love watching criminals getting hurt in cartoon-y violence. i recommend this to huge fans of the series only. 3/10',\n"," 'i would not say this is a bad movie; in fact it\\'s pretty typical of the type of film that the \"poverty row\" studios were releasing at the time. filmed for monogram, bela lugosi is very effective in his role as the somewhat demented doctor-scientist, masquerading as a respected member of the community. in this movie, bela and his henchmen have the nasty habit of stealing young brides, and, after their demise, injecting bela\\'s wife with a serum taken from their bodies in order to keep her young. lugosi is more than up to the task in making this an enjoyable film, however, the movie suffers from the ultra-wooden acting of co stars luana walters and tristram coffin. coffin (nice name for a guy in a horror flick) is especially bad in this case. i have seen him in numerous movies and tv shows and he is always the same; stiff, wooden and utterly unconvincing. miss walters is only slightly better, but she too lacks the acting talent to make her role believable. still, the viewer can enjoy the great lugosi act out yet another dastardly scheme only to be foiled in the end!

(it ought to be overblown in a movie like this.) see george hamilton do a better job with better lines in his dracula parody, \"love at first bite\". it\\'s not a total waste and there are some funny moments. it\\'s just that there are not enough of them.',\n"," 'man with the screaming brain is a story of greed, betrayal and revenge in the a small bulgarian town. william cole, wealthy industrialist, winds up with part of his brain replaced by that of a russian cab driver yegor. the two could not be more different, but they share one thing - both were killed by the same woman. brought back to life by a mad scientist, william and yegor form an unlikely partnership to track down their common nemesis. bruce campbell returns to the b horror movie genre that gave him his cult status, this time not only in front of the screen, but behind the lens. unfortunately for this time around, the laughs do not deliver and campbell has to resort to what he does best to try and fill the gap in this film. as a fan of campbell, who has the movies, the books and the action figures, i was hoping for another hit to add to my collection. although, after seeing this film before the purchase, i am glad that i do not have the \"pleasure\" of adding it. the film first goes wrong in the story, which at first sight, seems like harmless fun but turns out to be boring drawn out dribble. which is a sad thing to say because it was written by mr. campbell himself. the comedy never really hits, it only makes us scratch our heads. it seems that campbell ran out of things that are funny and resulted in giving the audience what we have already seen... him fighting himself. ted raimi, the brother of evil dead director sam raimi, is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. he brings a freshness to it and an entertaining time when the film really needs it. it helps if you are a fan and have been following these stooges from evil dead to xena, which is why i felt compelled to like this film. campbell\\'s experience as a director, from directing episodes of the tv series hercules is apparent. campbell makes the film work well enough, even with the low-budget. in the end, there are not as many things going for this as one would hope for, but the fans of campbell will stick behind it no matter what, unfortunately for this fan... i will not.',\n"," 'i am not someone who insists that a movie adhere strictly to the book on which it is based. moreover, i recognize that a teleplay must omit some parts of the book in order to fit in an 80-minute timeframe. however, i expect the essential theme of the book to be maintained. this adaptation fails miserably in that respect. rather than paint a picture of the futility of playing god, writer alan sharp and director philip haas chose to give us a one-dimensional cliché of the self-aggrandizing scientist (james caan\\'s dr. haber) and us a shallow love story. haber\\'s desire to mold a better world through george orr\\'s power, his attempt to convince george to join him in the effort rather than resist, and his inability to see that the consequences of meddling with reality are unpredictable -- all of this is lost in haas\\' adaptation. instead, we see haber using george to obtain successively more magnificent office space and a progressively more fashionable secretary. george\\'s love interest, heather, is reduced to an odd obsession; heather\\'s own attempt (and failure) in leguin\\'s novel to use george\\'s power for public good never appears in haas\\' film. perhaps the pettiest departure from the book was sharp and haas\\' choice to have dr. haber say \"new york\" (instead of \"antwerp\") as the phrase that induces george orr\\'s dreams under hypnosis in their first session. interestingly, haber never uses the phrase again in any of the subsequent dream scenes. maybe haas was embarrassed by his own pettiness. even as a standalone movie, this film is a poor one. lisa bonet\\'s character, heather, was completely unbelievable. are we really supposed to accept that a successful and self-assertive lawyer will drive out to a remote location and jump into bed with a psychiatric patient about whom she knows very little and that she will remain there with him for days in the face of his increasingly obsessive behavior - simply because he says he feels he knew her from a previous life? in another scene, we are given hints that george\\'s friend, manny, may be more than he seems. he appears in each of george\\'s realities, and he seems to recall all of them. yet the film does nothing with this; it is simply a loose string left for us to puzzle on. the final scenes are rushed and confusing, leaving the viewer with the sense that haas simply ended the show in order to fit into the time he had available. philip haas has not made a decent movie since his 1995 `angels and insects.\\' this version of `the lathe of heaven\\' continues his streak of losers. if you want to see a good film adaptation of leguin\\'s book, buy the 1980 pbs version instead.',\n"," 'kevin smith made \"clerks\" on low budget with a little help from his friends. that movie became a hit, and smith earn a

unlikely for you to figure any of this out without reading a synopsis first, and it's not especially important to the film that you do, as it's more a surrealistic art-house imagery thing, all in inky, processed black and white. a sick, bleak atmosphere is created with the stark photography and minimal sounds (mostly water dripping, groans, scrapes, etc.) but each scene goes on a bit too long and so does the film as a whole. this could have been great as a short film, and the god killing himself scene was excellent and extremely creepy, especially being the first thing you see, but it's

have realated to anyone, the fighting was unrealistic and it sucked... along with the plot. if you really think about it's a wannabe buffy the vampire slayer, a girl who is the descendant of other warriors who were women, a girl wants to ignore her calling and wants to become homecoming queen, the watcher who bug's her to prepare for a big fight against some ancient evil. the idea just was not all that original, the movie is waste of time.\",\n"," \"subspecies is set in romania where two american college students michele (laura mae tate) & lillian (michelle mcbride) arrive to study local folklore with the aid of local friend mara (irina movila). there they rent rooms in a hotel & become curious about the mysterious ruins of a nearby castle, it turns out that a powerful & evil vampire named radu (anders hove) lives there who has stolen the bloodstone from his father king vladislav (angus scrimm). radu takes a fancy to the three girls & starts drinking the blood of mara & lillian, meanwhile michele falls for a guy named stefan (michael watson) who just so happens to be radu's brother. michele & stefan decide to team up & rid the world of the evil radu... directed by ted nicolaou this film seems to be quite highly regarded amongst genre fans & while it's not terrible i certainly would not call it very good & i could't really see anything much to get excited about. subspecies is a rather slow going film, not that much actually happens & while it does try to stay close to certain classic vampire lore there's all this nonsense about a bloodstone & some little monsters that grow from the tips of radu's severed fingers for some reason. subspecies could have been a half decent film if not for the fact that it's dull, i really can not remember that much about it, good or bad. the character's are alright but some f the dialogue is silly & there's a scene which bugged me near the start when the girls are at the castle ruins & one says they have to go because it's getting dark yet it's still clearly the middle of the day & very bright. there's also a scene where one of the american girls finds a coffin that hotel's attic & does not really seem that bothered by it, i am not being funny but is some bloke whose house i was staying at had a coffin in his attic i would be very, very worried if you know what i mean. i do not think i would ever want to watch it again, there's no real threat, the plot is weak that mixes classic vampire themes with silly subplots & i was distinctly unmoved by it all. not the worst film ever but hardly the best either. the film looks alright with nice locations & some local scenery although you feel the look is down to the budget rather than the makers attempt a authenticity. there's not much gore apart from a decapitation & some broken off finger tips. for no apparent reason the makers throw in some average looking stop-motion animated monsters that really do not do anything or have much significance to the story. filmed on the cheap by charles band's full moon entertainment production company in bucharest in romania, the production values are alright & better than many later day band productions. the acting is not great with many of the cast putting in below par performances while genre regular angus scrimm has a small cameo at the start. there's a little bit of style here on occasion with a few scene reminding heavily of the original nosferatu (1922) in particular the bit showing radu's shadow coming down the stair with his long claw like fingernails standing out. subspecies is a film that many seem to like for reasons i do not quite see, i thought it was throughly average at best & overall rather dull. followed by bloodstone: subspecies ii (1993), bloodlust: subspecies ii (1994), subspecies 4: bloodstorm (1998) & the spin0off film vampire journals (1997).\",\n"," 'i can not believe anyone could rate this above a 5. even sappy people will groan at this film. the characters all seem to be mentally retarded and have the emotional depth of 10 year olds. really, this is a painfully bad movie that i would have walked out on except that i was too lazy to reach for the remote control which had fallen on the floor. borderline soft-core porn is fine if you can actually believe it, but this movie was just a joke. the scene where morgan freeman wanders into the stadium to see two people getting it on actually made me laugh out loud, then i realized the only way to watch this film is to treat is as a joke, laugh and make mystery science theatre 3000 style comments and you will have a good time.',\n"," 'i was actually looking forward to seeing this movie because i have a step father who i often feud with. so naturally i was hopping this would cheer me up and get me to laugh. but boy did this movie depress me and boy did it make me angry. first let me go over what i did like about this film before i trash it. it had what could have been a really good and funny plot. our lead character discovers that the evil gym teacher that tormented him in middle school is now going to marry his mother. basically think of that teacher from high school or middle school who hated your guts. you did not do anything he/she just hated you and made it clear. now imagine if that teacher going to be your new stepfather/stepmother. what do you do? this sounded hysterical and in the films defenses there were a few funny moments. sadly however those funny moments were all given away in the trailer. this would be the first problem i had with this film. all the parts that come to mind as being the highlights were already spoiled and what\\'s left is okay but not great. however let\\'s talk about the story a little more. as i said before our star use to be stuck with an evil gym teacher who was out to make his life a living hell. now he\\'s all grown up and has used his experiences with \"mr. woodcock\" to write a self help book. this book becomes a best seller and he now teaches people how to let go of there past. things are going well until his past come back to hunt him! now that also could of bin funny. watching a mans message of letting go of the past get challenge by the bad things that happen to him long ago. sadly it does not play out well and i will explain later. this woodcock fellow dose not seem to regret any of the mean things he has done to him. in fact he\\'s very mean to everyone and everything. they made him such a jerk to the point you can not bring your self to like his character. the mom on the other hand seem really nice but one cant help but wonder what is she thinking, is she that desperate? the guy makes very rude and mean spirited comments to her son, even going far to make sex comments about his mother. he treats the people in the town like dirt and everything that comes out of his moth is negativity and insults. some time his abuse gets physical. so i was starting to think the story was about an evil step father who the son had to save his mother from marrying. after all for some reason he and us the viewer can only see what a bad guy woodcock really is. but no. by the end of the movie the son must learn to respect woodcock and his very abusive ways. so according to the movie women are better off pretending there abusive spouse is a good guy in spite of the fact he treats the world like dirt. for all women can not be happy unless they have a man, even if he is a creep. what kind of message is that to send out! okay, dose our hero at least manage to persevere his message he has become popular selling? no, by the end he turns back on all of that and decided to take after his mom. give into stock home syndrome and convinces himself that woodcock is a good guy. so he finds himself apologizing to an unapologetic abusive jerk. he even declares that all the abuses was good for him. what kind of message are they trying to send out? well did woodcock learn any lessons, become sorry for his actions and show off that there is a nice guy in there some ware? as i already said no. they make it very clear he is not sorry for any the things he dose. in the movies meet the parents and meet the fockers, our lead faced a similar problem with his father in law to be. however that worked out on screen much better. why? because by the end the character who was being a jerk learned his lesson and realizes he was in the wrong. something that never happens here. the best we get is when woodcock said \"i am \"basically\" sorry\" to the mom but after the entire movie one cant help but feel more mad then amused. to make things a little worse thing are never resolved. like there a little romance going on between our star and a girl he knew from his old school but it never went any ware. in fact in one moment our \"hero\" cames off as a bit of jerk to because it seems he did not care much for her at all. so now our lead character not that likable earthier. then when it gets to the end the movie feels as if it just stops. no laterally, it feels like it stop in mid-moment and then the credits start. leaving the movie feeling unfinished and made to quickly. over all what could of bin a good movie falls apart because things are never resolved, characters are unlikable, and sends out the message that abuse; verbal or physical is cool as long as your mom love him. that why mr. woodcock gets a 3 out of 10.',\n"," 'as betty sizemore (renee zellweger) secretly watches her tyrannical husband del (aaron eckhart) being murdered by the vengeful hitmen charlie and wesley (morgan freeman and chris rock), her bruised sense of reality becomes totally immersed in the fantasy world of her favorite soap opera. in a state of complete denial and delusion, betty escapes both physically and mentally from her unsatisfied, small town life to search for \"dr. david ravell\" (greg kinnear), the handsome and loving hero of \"a reason to love\", a soap opera set in a hospital and produced in los angeles. immune to reality, betty arrives in l.a. and becomes \"nurse betty\" as she tries to belong in the hospital world of her dream lover. meanwhile, the angered charlie and wesley track betty down, convinced she is a dangerous witness who also knows about their compromising dealings with del. nurse betty creates comedy and suspense by contrasting its main character\\'s extreme innocence and optimism with the evident hypocrisy and violence that surround her. by clearly defining the protagonist\\'s difficult life, nurse betty justifies its character\\'s tendency to turn away from reality. thus, while offering a comment about the popularity of the soap opera within the film, nurse betty also makes a comment regarding the widespread addiction to television and its celebrities. in addition, nurse betty benefits from the effective manipulation of its protagonist\\'s mental state, particularly in those scenes where she cannot distinguish between \"dr. david ravell\", the character, and george mccord (greg kinnear), the actor who plays him. betty\\'s incapacity to recognize george as an actor leads to funny misunderstandings, which stress the magnitude of her delusional state. however, in spite of these successes, nurse betty suffers from the troubling characterizations through which the narration evolves. for example, while charlie and wesley are consistently portrayed as a comical pair, the brutality of their actions undermines any sense of appreciation or acceptance the viewer might have initially experienced. similarly, although the initial scenes establish del as a detestable man, the humiliation and violence he experiences with his murderers surpass all the humiliation and violence he caused his wife betty. finally, toward the end of the film, charlie undergoes awkward transformations as he develops an obsession for betty; an obsession which results in noble feelings of love, and which ultimately destroys him. consequently, since the characters\\' roles as victims lack consistency, the story\\'s victimization processes seem random and unsubstantial. all in all, nurse betty\\'s indeterminacy --rather than creating suspense-- weakens its characters and pollutes its plot.',\n"," 'opera opens with a very close-up shot of a bird\\'s ever-watching eye and thus begins one of argento\\'s most bizarre, and enjoyable, features (my second favorite in fact, behind deep red). granted, at times, the movie is pretty absurd (the lack of real concern after murders, the bird attack, the burnt dummy, that ending ) but this is argento\\'s fantastical world and once you come to terms with that, you\\'ll find that it works. i do not mean to completely dismiss these faults though, rather that the artistry of the film more than makes up for them. for example, the aforementioned bird attack is completely over-the-top in theory, yet look at the wonderful execution of it; crows flying in chaos, adding their enraged squawking to the driving rock beat, the crowd in panic as seen through the circling, bird\\'s-eye view camera-work, and then the focused attack; aria of terror indeed. argento\\'s amazing, flowing cinematography is on full display in opera, and clearly one of the film\\'s highlights. i also enjoyed the soundtrack of operatic themes and rock music, a nice contrast of music with each used effectively (the rock kicks in with the murders in perfect timing and gives the scenes a very frenzied feel). the sound effects deserve a nod too, stabs, scissors, beaks, and all. inspector alan santini: \"i have seen a lot of your movies. yes, you are really an expert in this field. i\\'d be very interested to know your opinion.\" marco: \"i think it\\'s unwise to use movies as a guide for reality, do not you inspector?\" inspector alan santini: \"depends what you mean by reality.\" being that this is a giallo, stylish murders are a must and dario does not disappoint (the \"bullet through the door\" scene is quite possibly one of the greatest deaths ever shot, if you\\'ll forgive the pun). the black-gloved, deep-voiced, pulsating brained (cool shots!) killer is cold and brutal, and having him tape pins under our heroine\\'s eyes so that she was forced to watch the murders was a nice touch. that all said, as a giallo, opera does not quite have as good of a mystery as it should. the killer is kept secret from the audience well enough but there\\'s little effort in the film devoted to actually solving the murders. this, and the strange ending, could have used more work. despite these problems though, opera still manages to be a worthwhile and satisfying horror film. one final note: it was nice to see a movie, for once, show the correct view through binoculars (just a circle, not two circles together)! nice eye for detail, dario!',\n"," 'as bad movies go, this is pretty bad... which is pretty good if you are a bad-movie buff (like i am). but then what else would you expect when it stars dennis rodman? surprisingly enough, rodman is almost low-key, to the point where you could actually say he almost gives a decent performance. almost. still, it must be said his performance here is worlds better than in \"double team\", that classic of bad-moviedom. perhaps because he\\'s almost restrained, the makers of this have decided to bypass intelligent character or plot development (a fact given away by its grammar-savvy title) and packed it with common-denominator bits that are dime-store quality even by the action genre\\'s sorry standards. and then there\\'s the acting... dane clark, as rodman\\'s bumbling sidekick, pours it on thick with what is meant to be comic relief, but is neither comic nor relief; at no moment is he even barely amusing. if that were the very worst, it would be borderline tolerable, but oh no -- they have thrown in the comedy stylings of ricky harris & john pinette as two computer-geek-slash-ass-kicking-slash -jive-slinging monks (monks!) who help and/or guide rodman (it\\'s never really explained); john pinette is an embarassment not only to actors, but comedians, fat people, monks and especially himself: \\'fat\\' jokes are one thing but nearly every opportunity is taken -- with his blessing and help! -- to show him eating, or shaking his bountiful belly, or wanting to eat... until, of course, at the movie\\'s climax, when he (or, rather, a stunt double) suddenly turns kick-boxing action star. said scene provides the single most unintentionally funny moments: try holding back the laughs when it\\'s obvious pinette\\'s double is only about 6 inches taller and 100 pounds lighter (despite the padding), and watch as a baddie is kicked over a bridge and actually slows as he falls, thanks not to slow-mo but to the bungie cord. oh, and then there\\'s the, ahem, \"special effects\". can you say \"blue screen\"? the only member of this cast (designed to appeal to every possible international audience) that shows signs of real energy is emma sjosberg, who shares a thankfully-brief love scene with rodman (she kisses him on the lips and does not vomit. now that\\'s what i call \\'acting\\'!).',\n"," \"i was fairly lost throughout most of this film, and i am the one who usually understands the works of such enigmatic cinema greats as david lynch (twin peaks: fire walk with me) and darren aronofsky (pi). not to say that northfork does not make sense on some level, it just does not combine to form a wholly coherent film. as time passes from watching the film, its themes and intentions become clearer, but during my initial viewing, i was really confounded, and i find that this is the major fault of the film... its lack of direction. the plot centers on the town of northfork, montana in the year 1955. the town has been emptied and will soon be flooded to make way for the creation of a hydro-electric dam. the major problem is that not all of its inhabitants are willing to be evacuated and relocated. a group of men are hired to coerce the remaining residents out of the town before it will be drowned, and for the most part they succeed amidst some fairly odd situations and townspeople. simultaneously, the film tells the story of irwin, a very sick young boy (or is he a fallen angel?) whose adopted parents gave him back, due to his illness, to the northfork orphanage that they adopted him from. father harlan (nick nolte) cares for the dying irwin, but irwin imagines (or does he?!) that a group of angels (including daryl hannah and anthony edwards) have arrived in the desolate and empty town looking for a fallen angel. irwin has scars on his back and on his head, and he tries to convince the angels that his scars are where the humans amputated his wings and halo. oh yeah, and during all of this there is a strangely surreal walking animal on stilts that roams throughout the backdrop of the landscape. there are a lot of other small events that happen in the film, but none of them end up amounting to much more than momentary intrigue. one can appreciate the artistic quality of the film (it's obvious that the filmmakers cared deeply about this film) and its rich cinematography, but the film still tries too hard to be different and then gives up and whimpers to an end without making much of a statement. like i wrote earlier, it becomes clearer, long after viewing, what has possibly taken place in the film. irwin is dying, and so is northfork, and in coping with his own loss and death, irwin has most likely created characters, from ideas he gets from the objects that surround him at the orphanage, to console him as he is abandoned and his life nears its end. but then again, maybe he really is an angel, and he has found his kind and can now return home. i must emphasize that there are some truly beautiful moments in the film, heartbreaking, vivid and full of loneliness and sadness. unfortunately, the film as a whole just ends up feeling disconnected and somehow incomplete.\",\n"," \"what a plot. what nice parents. what a quickie. sex to die for. hum! this film started off confusing enough. she felt she had killed her parents so she sees the ghosts of them. would they have done this? the parents i mean. they loved their daughter and did not blame her for anything. so her guilt was her own and she runs from the cemetery leaving her car behind. sees her dead parents in the house and runs out of the house and into her car. where did that come from? she drives from home miles and miles (how interesting-not!) then she picks up a stranger and chats and forgets to drop him off and gives him a hug. he was a hitch-hiker when do hugs come into it. the then poor guy (oh how things change) had to walk home after all. oh and the rain that fell just in front of them without them getting wet (someone with a watering can in front of the camera?). so the story develops. this is deadsville with more corpses than you can poke a stick at. someone said that they reminded them of the '70's but then for me the whole film did. actually the film got a wee bit better and i did stay with it until the end. i guessed the dead bits (it was not hard) and i liked the idea of the sheriff being supportive (young though. and i like the idea of the drowned town and the death/hauntings. look i was generous giving this 3 but it did have some endearing qualities. naff lines like, killing people. marvelous! the little girl was quite creepy on her own. and why do all dead children of the female persuasion look like her? i loved the dead getting up in

abruptly solved, forms the substance of this \\'savior de f aire \\'. production values have substantial glitz and glamour. technically apt. cameraman harmeet singh seems to have been literally in a holidaying mood, so he has beautifully captured the new scenic locales of cine tirol region and salisberg - austria, where nothing else but only the songs have been canned. editor a.muthu has been hampered by the hackneyed story, screenplay, dialogues of rumi jaffery, ikram akhtar, yunus sajawal and even their constant take-off on senior actors like dilip kumar and amitabh bachchan was not in very good taste. musically the anand-milind - sameer combo leaves much to be desired, with only the title song sung by the principal actors,\\'chori chori sapno mein aata hai koi\\' and \\'meri neend jaane lagi hai\\' that are worth humming. performancewise sanjay dutt excellent as usual and exudes a tremendous screen presence. salman khan too matches his senior co-star especially in the comic sequences. karisma kapoor successfully displays her comic forte, apart from portraying all the nuances of her well defined role. on the other hand naghma, sonali bendre and twinkle khanna\\'s gutsy,

been repeated in many films, and recently in \"dillagi\" and \"pyar koi khel nahin.\" performance-wise, sanjay dutt impresses. salman khan is natural. karisma kapoor is lively. shakti kapoor, sushma seth, dalip tahil, himani shivpuri and asrani provide able support. as the director, david dhawan again shows competence as a maker of light comedy. the drawback is that david and his team of writers

argentina before i was born, i was used, kind of, to the heavy argentinian accent that the actors have, federico luppi especially. however, i agree it might be difficult for other spanish speaking people who are used to a more 'orthodox' spanish to understand parts of the dialogs, which is a shame. dialogues are what makes this film so interesting and touching. the things that are said contrast with the things that remained unsaid, and you can only imagine by reading the character's eyes. alicia, for example, is almost always laughing and having fun, but her eyes are dark, worried. her happiness is just a mask she wears to avoid realize how much she feels bad about what she is missing for, a real family, with children. she only tells hache about that, she wishes she were his mother. hache apparently is resigned to being a nuisance for his parents, but he wants to escape this situation by living alone, even though he's not ready yet. he uses drugs and only his father's best friend manages to keep him away from danger. the two main actors were great. federico luppi's portrayal of a father who is very disappointed for his son's way of life was so real i wanted to kick him! juan diego botto was perfect, too. you could think he was portraying himself. i wonder if it's a pity he lives in spain and his works are not known across the atlantic ocean, nor east of the pirineos.\",\n"," \"boris karloff's name is what brought me to this picture, and without him, i think, the film might have been just another b movie programmer from the forties. i have just learned a little about producer val lewton, and their collaboration here is what gives the picture some of it's momentum. while watching however, i never really got the impression that this was going to be much of a horror film. yes, there's mention of evil spirits and malignant forces, and even a word about the dreaded vorvolaka, an undead vampire-like creature that's part of greek folklore. but even with a mysterious madame kyra (helen thimig) professing such belief, and others in the story buying into it, the production makes it pretty plain that the reason folks are in danger is because of a plague that has infected the island. the attempt to link thea (ellen drew) to malevolent forces did not really work for me, she was just too wholesome and good looking to imply a serious threat. that role should probably have gone to madame kyra, perfect for someone warning about vorvolakas to actually be possessed by one. what works best i guess is the way general pherides (karloff) slowly unravels from a man of strong principal and belief in science to a mad man intent on eliminating a superstition come to life. it's that psychological aspect to the drama that holds more water than the implied horror component, even if mrs. st. aubyn escapes from her coffin. enough explanation revealed her bouts with cataleptic trances and fear of being buried alive to make that an expected part of the story, and one would presume that that was enough to put her over the edge with the old poseidon sword. nevertheless the film is enjoyable on a number of levels; for one, lovers of old films will delight in the great ambiance of an isolated, wind swept island and the dark, moody atmosphere of the albrecht home. the characters never wear out their welcome, and as others on this board have suggested, those that might have make an early exit. be prepared though for a karloff you have not seen before, all the while i just could not get used to seeing him in a military uniform with curly hair.\",\n"," '(spoilers?) i was not sure what to think of the movie. not too much of a kids film. definately should be watched with a parent because it includes death and dying. but i was surprised

now there is a classic. \"pariah\" is almost good compared to that one! a.c.a.b.',\n"," 'this show is about putting a person into a job that she does not have the basic requisite skills to perform properly. in particular, lauren jones, a former miss new york, is assigned to a job as an anchorman at a struggling texas television station. she has no training with television or production equipment, or with doing news broadcasts. such a concept may work in a scripted fiction show as there would typically be a reason why the person has to try to sustain the appearance of competence, and there would be humorous situations and dialog built in. however, it does not work with a reality show, as comments and situations as those that make the tv series \"the office\" or the movie \"anchorman\" amusing would (usually) never be made by real people in real jobs. the idiocy in anchorwoman is incredibly predictable and not at all entertaining. we all deal with inept people at work, and it is frustrating, not funny. as an analog, how amusing would it be to watch someone technologically illiterate be put in the job of a network administrator where he had to call the boss to bail him out for even basic tasks? this is absolutely the worst show i ever saw. the genre was listed as comedy and reality. comedy is supposed to be funny and reality is supposed to be riveting; this show was neither. very quickly i did not find it entertaining (the initial allure of lauren jones\\' looks wore off rather fast), but since it was the premier episode i decided i would give it a chance and stick with the show for the entire half hour. unfortunately, when 30 minutes was up, there were no final credits, and a quick info check on the tivo revealed the show was actually a full hour. i rarely do this, but with anchorwoman i decided i could not force myself to sit through another 30 minutes. i changed the channel and did not go back, and i never had any qualms about not finding out how the show ended. fox made a very wise decision to limit its damage and not air a second episode.',\n"," 'wow, what a fascinating movie and different kind of film. one really can not get the full impact of this through a review. anyone who has seen this, i think would agree with me on that. if i had skipped over the credits and someone had told me terrence malick (days of heaven, the new world, the thin red line and badlands) and directed this film, i would have believed it. visually, this is his kind of film. i wonder if this movie inspired parts of his latest effort, the new world? there are a number of similarities. black robe has the same kind of beautiful and haunting images malick\\'s films possess but the director in this case is bruce bereford, the man who directed driving miss daisy a couple of years before doing this film. dmd also is beautifully-filmed. black robe is not just a piece of art. as great as it is visually, this is a powerful story of a well-intentioned jesuit priest in the early 17th century who travels to \"new france\" (upstate new york/french canadian territory) attempting to convert a few area tribes to christianity. to unbelievers, that seems pushy but biblically-speaking it is not. jesus commanded his followers to do just that (matt. 28:18-20) , so the priest is only doing what missionaries have done for centuries. he also is a good man, stays strong in his beliefs regardless of his own well-being and is a gentle soul. kudos to the filmmakers for being fair to him. the algonquins and the hurons are also shown with their beliefs, too, and their cultures which obviously were in contrast to the white european-based priest. all sides are shown fairly in this movie, with both positive and negative traits of all. i was shocked at a few scenes in here, not expecting them as the film has such a gentle flow to it before anything dramatic happens. we see a few sexual scenes and then some brutal violence. the hurons, particularly, do not want any invasion of their privacy and culture and are openly hostile to the priest and the algonquins. the story transforms from a quiet malick-type \"new world\" poetic piece to a violent, suspenseful film and the question is, will the \"good guys\" make it out alive?

from providing the caffeine kick you'd expect from a film that shares its name with the most energy-boosting of warm beverages, coffy clunks about and never really rises above being just a ropey revenge tale. indeed, if the movie was a cup of coffee, it'd be rather weak and watery, littered with a few undesirable dregs and lacking in a lingering aftertaste. sporadically it hits the spot, but otherwise it is not the hot action-drama it hopes to be. plot-wise, coffy is a nurse who takes the law into her own hands and delivers hard justice to the drug-pushing, lady-pimpin', mob-suckers that hooked her younger sister into a depraved, sick state. socio-political commentary on the plight of urban black youths in america is prominent in coffy, and it makes for some thought-provoking stuff as coffy crusades against the political corruption and white establishment racism that profits and acts as a parasite off the targeted afro-american minorities. sadly, the timely messages are undermined by the film's poor quality and lack of focus. coffy's ideas are important, it's just that they are not well-aimed. one of the plus points of coffy is the presence of blaxploitation icon pam grier. grier goes at her role with gusto and makes for an appealing action heroine as she shotguns down the scum in her often spectacular acts of vigilante violence (how do you deal with a house full of hoods? drive the car right through the front door!). it's just a shame that the storyline wavers on occasions, wasting time squeezing as much sexual exploitation as possible. the low budget can not have helped, but neither does the fact that for a blaxploitation flick, coffy lacks groove. just as the issues are undermined by the lack of quality, consequently the entertainment and excitement are also skewered by moments of dullness and misdirection. the total result is workmanlike and wooden. we get a hip heroine but not a hip movie. it's a shame as coffy has its moments and should rightly be regarded as a key film in the blaxploitation craze; it just never ascends above being an average, lukewarm number.\",\n"," \"i just rented blackwater valley exorcism because the cover and pictures

sort of cowardly lion meets chewbacca meets uruk-hai warrior. a few of the non slave humans survive in the wild without any kind of technology, living as primitives. one of them, jonnie goodboy tyler (barry pepper, who looks like clint howard with an anorexic matthew lillard combined) is taken prisoner. (spoilers) in captivity he plans revolution and thanks of the sheer stupidity of the psychlos, the crappy script and a healthy diet of rats (do not ask) he gets away with it, a final battle is set, primitives humans who knew nothing about technology learn how to fly combat jets in a few days in flight simulators with only repeating \"piece of cake, piece of cake\" as a motto. then is psychlos v/s humans. who will win?... (end spoilers) according to john travolta this is a movie he wanted to make for more than 20 years in honor of his dear mentor mr. hubbard. it seems that the wait was in vain. apparently the filmmakers and producers were aiming high with this movie, they were dreaming another \"star wars\" trilogy in the making with thousand of millions wasted in merchandising, action figures and promotion, several spin off were planned before the premiere(including a sequel and even an animation series!) but after the box office and critical slaughter they wake up and realize they got \"robot monster\", \"plan 9 of outer space\", \"manos, the hands of fate\", \"santa claus conquers the martians\", \"terror from the year 5000\" and \"mommie dearest\" all rolled into one. this lifeless, cliche ridden waste of film is one of the worst movies ever made. no doubt about it. everything that made the cinema art great is wrong in this one. terrible script, inept direction, ugly photography and lighting, lame editing, overblown sound, obtrusive camera angles, run of the mill special effects and the acting my god! the acting is incredible bad. the entire cast is making fool of themselves but it seems they thought they were doing shakespeare in space. the urge of bursting into laughter after reading those lines must have being difficult to repress during the filming. and even under thousand of layers of bad make up you can still notice travolta hysterical overacting (who takes his character waay too seriously, channeling vincent vega by the way of danny suko with a little bit of tony manero on crack) and forest whitaker face of complete embarrassment. i felt sorry for barry pepper who must have signed the dotted line thinking this part would be his big break. i hope his career recovers. and why is richard tyson doing the role of tarzan in the future? or is deathstalker? or yor? my favorite is kim coates in the role of carlo, world\\'s biggest wimp and useless sidekick who spent the entire movie cowering in fear, arm waving, over reacting, and eye popping in extreme his green eyes, you\\'ll swear he is marty feldman in disguise. see it to believe it. and then exorcise your tv set. 1/10',\n"," 'no, it\\'s not citizen kane. but would you expect it to be with a name like \"meatballs\"? it\\'s the best damn summer camp movie of all the summer camp movies. does anyone quote \"little darlings\" line by line? or \"whitewater summer\"? this is just one of those movies that got into my brain when i was in junior high, and stayed with me all these years. every time i feel geeky, i mumble \"spaz. spaz. spaz. spaz.\" or when we are hiking in the brush in the forest, i tell my husband, \"i am wudy da wabbit.\" (he does not get it). \"it just does not matter. it just does not matter.\" i mean, this stuff is classic!

(not even you, gary, can dispute that claim) james gandolfini, who plays the lead-man, tony soprano, has become (in this viewer\\'s opinion) one of the \"hollywood elites\" as far as acting in a television series goes. i would not go ahead and compare him with robert deniro or al pacino, or at least, not just yet. he, however, does do a hell of a job playing the part of tony soprano. in the years since 1999, gandolfini has risen so much so as an actor (mainly thanks to his role in the sopranos) that today he is considered to be among the best in the business. and it\\'s not just him. \"the sopranos\" fields a great supporting cast including that of lorraine bracco, edie falco, michael imperioli, dominic chianese, and the late nancy marchand who played tony\\'s dreadful mother. at this point in the show\\'s existence, it\\'s being considered a cult-classic and rightfully so. the first two seasons were extraordinary. violent and quite gruesome in a pretty frequent manner, but without a doubt, extraordinarily done. the third season was great, but did not quite live up to the hype of seasons 1 and 2. season 4, which wrapped up right before new-years, was the weakest season yet (or at least, in my opinion it was). despite a dry-spell, i still found it (season 4 of \"the sopranos\") to be more entertaining than most of its competition and that\\'s saying a lot because lately i have been noticing a trend in good new television shows. examples of this: six feet under, the shield, curb your enthusiasm, and oz (which is not technically a new show but ended with an unforgettable final season this year). to get back to my point though, to consider a show better than all the competition during a particularly bad year, no less, is quite an accomplishment on the part of the writers. \"the sopranos\" ranks above and beyond all other television shows in its era and its writers deserve a lot of credit. to close, i\\'d like to say, \"the sopranos\" is the real deal folks. for the average mature viewer (17 and above) who enjoys drama and does not mind a mixing of a little violence and profanity, you might want to check out \"the sopranos\" if you get the chance. trust me in that it will be well worth the time.',\n"," \"saving grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon,when you are looking for something different than the regular scripts and wants to have some fun. i mean,the whole idea of this movie and all the marijuana in it is such a craziness! it was the first movie i watched with this theme(drugs/marijuana) that is not really criticizing it,only making jokes about it. grace trevethyn is a widow,who lives in a small town in u.k. and has many financial problems because of her dead husband, who committed suicide since he was full of debts. the problem is that grace, who imagined to have some money saved for her, discovers that she needs to pay all of her husband's pounds in debts to not lose all of her things, specially her house that she loves so much. she never worked before, and is in a tragic situation until matthew,her gardener who is very found of smoking pot, decides to make a partnership with her in selling marijuana in large scale.\",\n"," '\"what do you say to a naked lady?\" is a fascinating look at the sexual-social attitude changes in the united states during the transitional late 1960s. mr. funt, the power behind the popular entertainment programs \"candid microphone\" and \"candid camera\", may not have meant it to be, but this film brilliantly documents the generation gap between the 1950s post-ww ii parents/grandparents and their 1960s flower child progeny. dated to the extreme, it is a film of its time. (when a woman tries to sleep with a gay men, he\\'s tells her he can not because he\\'s \\'queer\\'. a white grandfather type tells of his opposition to his son marrying a mexican girl. the children,

with charles randolph hearst (of citizan kane fame) and they talked about their shared dislike of cannabis. now during this time, there was a real movement to make paper out of hemp. hearst did not like this notion because he owned so many timber yards and such, so he and anslinger agreed to work together to get hemp criminalized. first hearst started publishing false and sensational stories about the effects of marijuana. then anslinger hooked up with a film producer and the end result was reefer madness... crazy as it sounds, the scheme worked. the year after reefer madness was

nebraska), and if anyone disobeyed orders, and behaved irrationally (like some of the \"professionals\" depicted in this awful, awful, awful movie did), they\\'d have been shot on the spot. or, at least, we\\'d hope they would! my god, the bad acting in this movie, plus the bad writing, the bad production values (can you believe one reviewer on this board said, \"top notch production values\"? yeah, based on what, \"plan 9 from outer space\"?!), the bad special effects (on a level with the 60\\'s tv series, \"batman,\" actually!) and the bad direction, had me cringing in my seat! i quite literally had to watch this turkey to its unlikely conclusion, just to see how bad it could get! the absolute worst \"acting\" was perpetrated by the pilot, and co-pilot, of the b-52 crew (powers boothe and rebecca de mornay); do you think the writer of this schlock could have had them on the same page, for at least two minutes? i mean, one minute he (boothe) is at her throat, and the very next minute he wants to \"canoodle\" with her! he calls her the best co-pilot he\\'s ever had, and a heartbeat later, he\\'s giving her cyanide, and ordering her out of the cockpit! he (boothe)

wanted to call him \"aunt jemima!\" you want to take my advice, and the advice of a few other sane, rational and intelligent posters on this thread? skip this crud, and watch the vastly superior \"dr. strangelove,\" and \"fail-safe.\" even \"on the beach,\" with gregory peck, ava gardner and fred astaire, for end-of-the-world scenarios. bottom line: even the spoof, \"airplane,\" with leslie nielsen (!), made more sense than this bottom-feeder did.',\n"," \"featuring a few of hammer's all-stars, this highly effective slice of british horror revolves around a house and the fates of it's previous tenants, whose stories are all told to a scotland yard detective, in search of a missing actor. story number one, which is probably the least impressive of the four, deals with a writer and his wife who've just moved in the house and plan to stay just for a short time so that he may write one of his horror novels. he creates a demented character named dominic, who's a very creepy looking strangler, and soon finds himself going mad as he starts to seeing this beastly looking man everywhere he goes. after his wife convinces him to seek psychiatric help, a sub-plot is introduced which frankly, did not really work for me. i will not spoil it for you. the next story (the best in my opinion) stars the wonderful peter cushing as philip grayson, a man who's moved into the home for his retirement years and soon makes his way to a nearby wax museum(that deals in the macabre) where he's very startled to find a wax figure that looks exactly like a woman from his past. soon thereafter, an old friend(who also has a history with this woman) is in town for business and drops by to see him. the two men are in for a rude awakening as they soon discover that there was more to this woman than meets the eye. story three stars one of my very favorites... christopher lee, who plays john reid. after moving into the home with his peculiar daughter jane, the nanny that he hires becomes awfully suspicious as to the way reid suppresses his daughter. well come to find out... if she knew what lee did, she would have certainly understood. the final story is a rather light-hearted vampire tale that stars john pertwee and ingrid pitt. after buying a cloak from a mysterious merchant, actor paul henderson finds himself turning into the very creature that he's portrayed several times in his career. overall, the pacing and direction were very good, as was the most of the performances. there were nice gothic touches here and there and an effective score to complement the ambiance. this one's a keeper, and comes highly recommended.\",\n"," \"man with the gun is pretty much forgotten now, but caused a minor storm of media interest back in 1955 when robert mitchum turned down both jett rink in giant (which had actually been written for him and which was subsequently substantially reworked) and charles laughton's intended version of the naked and the dead to make it instead. despite some obvious production problems and some harsh lighting that occasionally renders both mitch and jan sterling in unflattering tones, it's a terrific dark western that more than stands comparison with his earlier blood on the moon as his 'town tamer' sets to work on a town that never had the chance to grow up before getting run down by the local badmen before turning out to possibly be almost as bad as the men he dispatches. certainly his way of dealing with news of a death in the family burning a saloon to the ground and goading its manager into trying to kill him does not inspire much confidence in his stability. as well as a good script and a surprisingly good supporting turn from the usually irritating but here well cast henry hull, it also boasts a strikingly good early alex north score, which even includes an early workout for one of his tormented emotional cues that would later turn up in spartacus.\",\n"," '10/10 plot discussion this is one of the best movies ever made and i am not saying that because i am being fooled by the seemingly nonsensical presentation. those who dislike the film because they do not understand the story often criticize those who are praising the film by saying that they are assuming its genius because they do not understand it. i do not view this movie as very allegorical. to me, it is a story with a beginning, middle and end. people become confused by the film because they expect it to have a deep, philosophical meaning that they are to interpret from the allegedly meaningless scenes. i feel they fail to realize that the crypticness comes from a chopped-up and rearranged plot combined with a very long and rather explanatory fantasy sequence and not from a chaos of visual allegory. because of the limitation of length, i will try to keep this short and to the point and touch on the major concepts. the general plot: diane moves to l.a. after jitterbug contest to get into acting. at an audition, she meets camilla with whom she falls in love. diane becomes enraged with jealousy since camilla sleeps with other men and women. diane discovers the other man (the director) at a film shoot and discovers the other woman (a random blond) at the engagement party for camilla and the director. motivated by her rage and possessiveness, diane hires a hit man to kill camilla. after that is done, she is overcome by loneliness and slips into an unconscious fantasy world where she lives the life she wants to. diane is then awakened. in her conscious state she is haunted by what she has done. the significance of the fantasy: the film starts out, after the credits, with a 1st person p.o.v. shot depicting somebody collapsing onto a bed and slipping into unconsciousness. this is where diane\\'s fantasy starts. the accident is there as an excuse for her to \"bring back\" her dead girlfriend and justify the fantasy life. she depicts her girlfriend as meek and innocent because that is what she wished she was. in the meantime, she acts like everything is \"like in the movies\" because she has an escapist personality. she also, in a sense, kills herself off and assumes the identity of a waitress named betty at a diner. the story revolving around the director is a direct result of her feeling that he was in someway victimized in reality just as she was and \"convinces\" herself that he was forced to choose camilla. it was also an unconscious expression of the lack of control she felt during the party. camilla rhoades in the fantasy is actually the random blond from the engagement party. she hated her so much that she turned her into camilla and made the ultimate antagonist. she then took the real camilla and turned her into a perfect, submissive out-of-the-movies girlfriend and used rita hayworth as an inspiration. she also paints the hit man as a very clumsy and incapable person to further justify the survival of camilla. her fantasy world, unfortunately for her, was a search for diane which ended up being herself and made the dreamworld die by taking her through a series of reminders of reality. the first reminder was club silencio which chanted that \"there is no band\" and the \"instruments\" you hear are not really there; this is a metaphor for the fantasy. she begins to shake violently because it shakes her perception of her surroundings. the other reminder is the blue box... actually, the blue box is not the reminder itself (more of a pandora\\'s box, really), but the blue key that opens the box. the blue key reminds her of the actual death of camilla because it is what the hit man said would show up when it was done. along with having love, this entire creation of hers is an escape from reality by living in the idealized hollywood that she expected to be part of when she arrived. this is a story showing the psychology of a very troubled woman who lost a dream. it is not series of random things specifically designed to disturb and it is not a cryptic philosophical message. it is an unfortunate chunk of the human condition that is presented beautifully. however, ultimately this is all my opinion. i may be way off. or it may not be intended to mean any one thing. there are many who disagree with me. great! afterall, why does it have to mean anything? why can not it just be a statement in itself? what if coherent, sensible narratives are shackles for artistic expression? peter greenaway, for example, has spent many words eloquently supporting that idea by such statements as \"i would argue that if you want to write narratives, be an author, be a novelist, do not be a film maker. because i believe film making is so much more exciting in areas which are not primarily to do with narrative.\" and where is the written rule that everything must be immediately understandable with only one possible interpretation? there is no such rule because the clarity of the movie is unrelated to the art of it. \"i did not understand it!\" so...? \"mulholland dr.,\" story or not, affects the viewers, harasses them, drags them, awes them, lulls them. the way it lends itself to interpretation is amazing. it never gets old. it never loses its luster. its visuals are always effective and beautiful. it is cinematic perfection no matter what. enjoy.',\n"," 'i am completely stunned by the amount of praise people seem to be lavishing on this

ex-low life (now nicknamed \"jimmy the saint\") andy garcia plans \\'one final job\\' for mobster christopher walken. for reasons that make absolutely no sense, he gets a bunch of idiotic misfits to

work with treat williams because he heard that treat was a \\'fecal eater\\' (a fact that does not exactly advance the plot) in prison. so for more minutes than we need, we see yelling and shouting about this. the job gets botched because... if it did not, there would be no movie. walken tells garcia that his crew will now be -- get this -- \"buckwheats.\" what are \\'buckwheats\\' you may ask? good question. as narrator jack warden (who inexplicably spends the entire movie telling us poor viewers what\\'s going on from inside the malt shop garcia is prone to visit)explains it,

locations. no one accepts these tickets because... well, if they did, the filmmakers would not be able to show us the various ways these people get tortured and killed by assassain steve (have they made a movie without me yet?) buscemi. lotsa wannabe hip dialogue is peppered throughout this movie in an obvious attempt to ape tarantino. the only problem is, the dialogue does not make a lot of sense without jack warden to explain it all. a complete waste of time. on scale of 1 to 10, give this one a 1... and that\\'s being generous.',\n"," 'pedro almodóvar changed the way of making cinema in spain; and doing it, he has impressed movie watchers around the world. you have seen his movies; they are a mix of cruelty that includes honesty and passion. not honesty in almodovar\\'s characters, but in the way they are written, showing a tough reality. about passion, well, it occupies a place in every person, but is not always shown; almodóvar takes care of that. he introduces you to the characters in the story, then he starts to develop a plot that you are going to see, even if it is predictable. víctor (liberto rabal) has lost, or not, his virginity with one woman (older than him). he\\'s not an expert when it comes to casual sex, but she wants to see this woman again, and does not understand why she acts like she did not care what happened. the thing is he does not know she does it every week. then we see david (javier bardem) and sancho (josé sancho) working in their car. they are cops. david is honest and professional, sancho is alcoholic and incontrollable; his wife, clara (ángela molina), cheats him with another man. sancho loves her, but beats her and keeps her locked in the house. the one who connects them all is elena. víctor fights with her, the police arrives, someone is shot and we see a frame that shows the movie some years later. the person who was shot is david, who walks (well, he does not walk) in a wheel-chair. david saved elena\\'s life; they are married. víctor is getting out of jail; he shot david. sancho is in the same situation with his wife. now víctor is angry, and plans his revenge; eventually he meets clara, and follows elena, and everything is connected again, until the end. javier bardem is excellent as david. he can cry while he talks and convince you that he is suffering. he is the finest spanish actor, and it was wonderful to see him fighting against his character\\'s decisions to do the things he has to. francesca neri did not seem spanish while i was watching the film. she is not, but she has the looks of a \"femme fatally\", and that was perfect for her role, which connected everything and had the strongest lines. josé sancho gives a good support as sancho, reaching the extremes with his face. his character is doomed, because what happens to him now is not going to stop, and the worst part is that he knows it. ángela molina does not have the chance to shine, but still does a decent work, with what she has got. she can not be having sex with one only man, and she shows it. liberto rabal does not show much acting talent, he\\'s not the mos experienced in the cast, but somehow, when he talks, he seems not right, but perfect, for his role. listen to him at the end and you\\'ll see. almovodar is gifted and he proves it in each frame of this tale. you need to look at every part of the shot to see the details he is giving to the piece. look at the sexual scenes; the balance he achieves: it\\'s not so strong, but not soft either. it\\'s subtle. his way of directing the actors is amazing. he writes the movie, and knows it more than anyone, so you know he is there to tell the cast what to do, and help them obtain their amazing performances. it\\'s a visual style with life of its own. i said it. there\\'s cruelty and honesty at the same time. there\\'s passion. there\\'s betrayal, lies, sex. you see it in the characters, in their words. when david arrives home and sees his wife elena in bed, and starts to touch her; she does not like it. \"what\\'s the matter?\", he asks. \"it hurts\", elena answers. \"why?\", he says. and with a face that involves everything i am talking about, she looks at him: \"because i have been having sex all night\"',\n"," \"this is the second poirot i have put back in the box before finishing. the first was sad cypress, and the reason is the same. both come across as overly melodramatic to me, with the romantic elements so pained that it seemed the character's heads would explode. i like my poirot in a lighter mode, and these to episodes seem to be spoken in a different language from the rest i have seen. i can imagine people liking this sort of thing, but i find it out of character for the series. as with someone above, i was bothered by the cuts between segments. a scene ends outside, and you are suddenly in a room and different people are talking already. i understand television breaks, but a few seconds to get you into a new setting would be appreciated. i certainly do not notice it in most poirots, but the last 2-3 i have seen have had the same problem. for all of you complaining about changes from the book - do you really want to know what happens next in every scene? how can you watch a mystery when there's no mystery? if i had read the books, i'd certainly want the dramatic version to have new elements to throw me off.\",\n"," 'i have to say, as a bsg fan i was not exactly sure what i\\'d think of this show. i saw it on the big screen at the arclight cinema tonight (as part of the paley center screenings), and the cast and film makers spoke after-wards. ron moore said they \\'wanted to make a clean break from battlestar, and do something different, and that yes they would lose some fans but hopefully they\\'d gain others\". even without their talk, i am now a fan of the new show. but here\\'s what i thought of the film. i loved it. it was really very good. i guess i am a true sci-fi (or \\'syfy\\' - do i really have to type that?) geek, because i\\'d totally watch this as a series. it has a strong and rich story, and kept my interest. it starts with a small group of teenagers plotting something, which to me was the weakest part and a bit confusing. the actor playing \"ben\" should have given us more of a glimpse into his intense beliefs. the actress playing \"zoe\" seemed a little posy, but she was playing a teenager (and i am sure i will not be the only one who thought \"zoe\" was a cylon at first, perils of being a bsg geek). if they are hoping these will be the new bamber/helfer/park, they may want to rethink it. surprisingly, it was the adults that captured the audiences attention. eric stoltz gives a stellar performance as daniel greystone, a man so haunted by his family tragedy that he jumps at the first chance of getting out of his grief and does not let go. he does a chilling and enthralling job of conveying his character\\'s sly knowledge of the inner world of computers and people, especially in a scene in which he spins a web for the young teenage friend of his daughters, traps her, then dismisses and releases her. no sign at all of the \\'serial killer\\' he played on gray\\'s anatomy, really impressive acting. equally as strong though not in it nearly as much is paula malcomson as his wife amanda greystone. she is just as smart and well written and beautifully played as stoltz\\'s part, and i completely believed that they are a couple, and a couple that have been together forever and have a strong relationship, something rarely seen these days. i look forward to seeing what happens with this family, and hope they give her as much to do as roslin in bsg- she is strong and smart and when she lashes out at her kid, you cringe, it\\'s really great. not to mention her eyes, which could hold magical powers, that\\'s how intense they are. the scene where she takes on the government agent- very short scene, but beautifully played- really gives you an idea of her power. the other part of the show that did not work 100% for me were the scenes with esai morales, and the mafia type clan of his. he does a good job overall, but i did not believe in this mobs power, nor intimidated by their threats. i found myself wishing that this whole story line was a bit more mysterious and hard to figure out; the way it is presented is almost an homage to the godfather, they kind of hit you over the head with it a bit. but given time, i can see how this will develop into an interesting \\'upstairs/downstairs\\' kind of thing, with the poor minorities (morales et al) versus the rich folk who rule the planet (stolz et al). and to be honest, i did enjoy it when he spoke to his son about the origin of their name- that was a very well played scene. note to bsg fans, the boy playing \\'willy adama\\' does not really look much like olmos, but he\\'s just a kid. whether or not he\\'ll be featured any more than he was in this film, who knows? i sure could not tell. but it did not bother me, because he was not as interesting as everything else going on around him. polly walker plays \\'sister clarice\\', and she\\'s chilling and odd in every scene she\\'s in. i am not sure where she\\'ll go or who she\\'ll end up with, but i was very impressed with her acting. in this film she was sort of on the side, but obviously being set up to play a very important part later on. she was nothing like her character in \"rome\", something i always find impressive in actors. one nice surprise- the music is actually better and less obvious than bsg, even though it\\'s the same guy doing it, bear mccreary. it has a haunting and unusual approach that took me by surprise, i\\'d buy this score if i had the chance. as to the \\'panel discussion\\' after the show, it was hosted by seth green. ron moore was very smart and articulate, david eick was cracking wise (much like his video diaries), esai morales told a long story about how he was cast, and eric stoltz was very funny and did not really answer the questions ( but i have always had a thing for him). paula malcomson was tough (she took seth green to task for mistakenly saying she was on \\'24\\'), and the girls who played zooey and lacey were both darling. grace park and tricia helfer were there as well, answering questions about how they did the scenes acting with themselves on bsg. overall a very interesting and wonderful evening. i am giving the show a 9 out of 10, and very much looking forward to watching it all unfold. note: i just watched this a second time and really hope they explore what the holoband was originally made for. i have no idea what that may be, but it holds a great deal of fascination to me.',\n"," 'the views of earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by nasa have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of apollo 11, and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the day. this would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the \"whole earth\" picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window. i am waiting for bart sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by nasa, though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map, and the ones in private hands would still be a problem. ah, a response: \"trying to discredit this movie by referring to nasa weather data i\\'d say

moon-missions were a success, and that man now are true masters of the universe. things are nearly never quite what they seem.. just watch the movie, and i dear say you\\'ll see things a bit different than before.\" first off, weather data does not come from nasa, it comes for met agencies around the world. second, the weather data undermines a major claim in the film. third, far from being \"packed with irrefutable evidence\", the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked. sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film, so he edited it and added his own interpretation. unfortunately for him, his source film is public domain, and the bits sibrel edited out contradict his claims.',\n"," \"given the opposite circumstance of 2009 where the reality is we do have a black president, this movie takes on quite a powerful historical significance. for entertainment value i found this movie to be both engaging and repugnant. i was quite taken back of course

is being consoled by his mammy. he is told 'why some day you could be president'. this was so ridiculous in 1933 that it was mocked and thought to be endearing, charming and funny. the bulk of the movie is a fantasy sequence of what the government would be like if it was run by a black man. they depict the seats of government as being like a revivalist baptist church. the fact was when i stumbled onto this movie one day it drew me in. it is really well done and very entertaining. i believe if we can look beyond the racism we can see this movie for all it brings us. in fact to realize that it is not only not ridiculous to have a black president, but that it is normal, just makes this movie that much more relevant. it clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness.\",\n"," 'this is a terrible movie, terrible script, bad direction and nonsensical ending. also, bad performances, except from clancy brown who is criminally underused here, and michael pollard. watching this movie was purgatory--you do it to unload enough bad movie karma to actually see a good one further down the line. the movie presents a father and son who look like they could not every possibly have been related. the part of the male lead is not well written and seems uncharismatic in this role. you can see the plot points a mile away. the actions of the female lead and that of her brother, the cop, also make no sense. so, a major action on her part at the end of the movie makes no sense script-wise.',\n"," 'this is one of the greatest love story movies i have ever seen. yes, i can agree that some parts may seem dated, but this does not distract from the film. one should try to observe, criticize and enjoy any art form from the perspective of the time. clearly by the \"sex in the city\" standards, charlie chaplin was horribly boring. however, when judged from the prospective of 1925 america, he was fantastic. likewise sayonara is a breakthrough film in its look into a mixed-race love affair, american \"manifest destiny\" arrogance and prejudice, and the complexity of different cultures. it is a natural next step to such films as gentleman\\'s agreement. its purpose, however, was not just social commentary, rather, it is entertaining and enjoyable, with innumerable lines that one just does not forget. however, even when taken only as a love story, it is terrific. although, some attack brando\\'s accent, he is at his near best in nuance and characterization. buttons and umeki (who both won oscars) and the rest of the supporting cast add much to the film. taka, the real star, does a fabulous job making you feel the passion she has for brando, while being torn by her sense of obligation and loyalty. her speech when she first meets and speaks with brando is a classic and something rarely if ever matched in cinema. the dialog between taka and brando in her dressing room in tokyo at the film\\'s end is equally good. of course, it does not have the mouth-sucking, spit-swapping and worse, that exemplifies love in today\\'s movies, but that makes it all the better. it portrays true love and passion, and not just \"heat.\" if this movie does not touch you, then you are just too young, too cynical or dead.',\n"," \"this movie is one of the best robert de niro films ever made. its endlessly quotable and has enough comedy and action to keep

joe pantoliano playing basically the same part he would play later on in bad boys. i would recommend this to anyone with a decent taste in movies. 7.5 is an abomination for such an excellent film. everybody needs to see it and then give it the rightful place it deserves 10/10. more laughs can be gotten from yaphat kotto's portrayal of alonzo mosely fbi. it has solid acting and a solid script.

movie together. i had heard that it was quite good. unfortunately who ever told me it was good never really watched it or had not seen it in years. the problem for me is that after a good opening segment of cartoons about birds the film becomes a music and dance fest. joe carioca and we get a song on baia. when panchito shows up we get surreal animation and some musical travels through mexico. its nice but any hope of it being anything more than \"music video\" is washed quickly away. perhaps its just a dislike for the images that have been married to some nice songs, but i really do not like this movie. the mixture of live action and animation does not really work. disney had been doing that sort of thing for twenty years prior to the release of this film and i expected more. mostly the problem is that once the animated characters leave the foreground they look like badly done rear screen projection with all the color washed out. if you must see this, rent it. actually rent it for the first half, but be prepared to dislike the second.',\n"," 'an intriguing, compelling script on mental illness keeps the audience guessing, with \"possessed\", starring joan crawford, van heflin, and raymond massey... not exactly a cast made up of sublimely beautiful people. :) i thought this film more realistic compared to \"the snake pit\" and other similar films exploring this topic, since the story builds so slowly here, and joan\\'s character appears normal in the beginning. a brief love affair with heflin\\'s character, who unceremoniously drops her when he gets bored with her, is the catalyst that puts her obsessive schizophrenia in gear. back and forth she goes between reality and fantasy, until a crime of murder is committed and she becomes catatonic. joan crawford stated she had to work harder on this film than on any other, but with what we know about her personal life today, we really have to wonder if she did have to work that hard at all. she did seem to me to be an obsessive, jealous personality in real life, so how was this part a big stretch for her? a word on heflin. what a cad he played in this film; joan\\'s character was almost justified in doing what she did to him, because it was obvious he was going to marry her step-daughter out of spite and greed. it does not matter that heflin was not the best looking fellow in the

multi-layered, memorable performance from the queen of the hangers.',\n"," 'what a great film! when ever i watch this movie, i sit with a big grin on my face. this was one of the first movies i saw at

many of doug mcclures movies, \"at the earths core\" and \"the land that time forgot\", made with a hint of tongue in cheek. made before the onset of cgi effects, this film has an innocent, non-cynical feel. it has monsters, the lost city of atlantis, guns, fight scenes and more monsters, what more can you ask for in a low budget sci-fi. films like this are often belittled by people who

lugosi is a real enigma. in the early 1930s, he was on top of the world after appearing in dracula. yet, again and again, he made lousy decisions regarding his career. perhaps he had a bad agent, perhaps his drinking and drug use had a part in it or maybe he was just crazy. regardless, he ruined his reputation by appearing in pretty much any film--ranging from excellent horror films (such as the raven) to big-budget flicks (like ninotchka) to grade-z flicks for the cheapest and shoddiest of studios. interestingly enough, although he agreed to do this terrible film, he actually turned down the role that later went to boris karloff in frankenstein! as for this movie, it is a very silly an horridly produced wwii propaganda film that featured a dumb plot and wretched editing. lugosi spends much of the movie murdering saboteurs--not a bad thing at all. but at the end, we find out that he is himself a nazi plastic surgeon and all the american-looking men he killed were actually japanese! the funniest part of this is during a flashback. you see lugosi talking to a group of japanese men before he changes them to american-like men. when the camera scans them, the men are clearly asian. but, on all the other non-close-up shots, they are all very western looking--many with bald heads! they looked absolutely nothing like japanese men. i suspect the plot must have undergone a re-write and this might account for the obvious mistake. or, it could just be shoddy production values and editing. in fact, early in the film, they show a street scene in the city and all the cars (circa 1942) are old model t fords--obviously from stock footage! the bottom line is that the film is bad but also very dull. unlike plan 9 from outer space, it's hard to laugh at the ineptitude--just be put to sleep by it.\",\n"," 'i own a copy of this film and have always loved it. i comment here, however, because i saw the pbs presentation of a concert version of sweeney todd earlier this week. that production was put on by the san francisco opera and starred george hearn and patti lupone. in the early \\'80s hearn replaced len cariou as sweeney (cariou had won the tony for his performance). i saw hearn and angela lansbury (who also won the tony for her performance as mrs. lovett) perform sweeney on broadway. they must have made the film at about the time i saw the show. to this day, the most moving moment i can ever remember in the theatre occurred when hearn sang \"these are my friends.\" (\"these are my friends, see how they glisten.\" \"my arm is complete again!\") hearn\\'s performance in the san francisco opera production convinced me that he has lost nothing in the nearly twenty years since i first saw him perform the piece on broadway and later in the film. what a

in the 80s, so i tried watching it again to see if my distaste for this film was down to my movie-going tastes in the 80s or was it that \"stripes\" is simply a bad movie. well, the verdict is in and \"stripes\" is a bad movie. now, \"stripes\" may have been innovative comedy in the early 80s, and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are bill murray fans, but its still a bad movie. why is it bad? mostly because \"stripes\" is supposed to be a comedy but it\\'s just not that funny. there are some laughs, but they are few and far between. most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting. this lack of comedy is especially noticeable if you are used to more contemporary comedies such as \"anchorman\" which strive for laughs in every part of the movie. \"stripes\" further suffers from bill murray and harold ramis\\'s lack of acting ability. bill murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career, and harold ramis is playing harold ramis. these two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the movie. lastly, most of the comedy that there is in \"stripes\" revolves around bill murray\\'s self-centered, smart-alec man-child character so if you do not find that character funny (like i did not) you are not going to find most of what little comedy there is in \"stripes\" funny either. \"stripes\" is very much a movie of its era, it has not aged well and is not worth watching. if you want to watch an early 80\\'s \"buddy\" comedy i would recommend \"stir crazy.\" like \"stripes\" the humor in \"stir crazy\" is not as fast-paced as in contemporary comedies, but unlike \"stripes\" it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable.',\n"," \"we saw a screening of arctic tale (or death of the polar bears) at the lloyd center cinema 10 here in pdx. i guess it is the finished cut, although the guy asking if we liked it did not seem to know or care. it seems as though it was shot in high-def and dv and maybe some vhs-c because there is zero consistency in the picture quality even within a given scene. this is no blue planet and it is now clear that national geographic has been completely deposed by the bbc as the reigning champ of these kind of films. we are reminded by the filmmakers who are doubtlessly evolutionary scientists that a jellyfish has not changed form for some 650 million years. this little factoid fits nowhere in the narrative, it is simply plugged in among the drowning bears. the jellyfish is perfect and has not needed to evolve since the seas were first poured out, the hapless bears, however, have come to rely on the ice that us selfish humans are now using to chill our budweiser. there is no doubt among any sentient beings that the earth is getting hotter--at the end of an ice age things tend to get a little toasty and barring any asteroid strikes it is likely that these warming trends will continue regardless of what mankind does to accelerate the process. it's going to get hotter and the polar bears will probably die when that happens. but if you are a pure darwinian evolutionist--who cares about the damn bears? the bears are simply unfit to survive in a warming climate created by us not-so-benevolent primates at our own imperative. people came from apes and we scratched some bones against some rocks and after a few years viola--chevrolet suburban! the bears had better learn to swim or grow some gills--really fast. tough luck bears! you are really cute in arctic tale, but frankly you have been known to eat people on occasion and your extinction, sad as it may be, will probably save a few wayward eskimos. there are also some walruses? walrii?--that are also going to croak because i spent and extra two minutes in the shower this morning. i now feel really bad that i have a water heater. i guess like gil says--all drains really do lead to the ocean. forget my shower--the cooling system at san onofre must really be screwing with the walruses. needless to say, we are going to kill all the creatures that rely on it being really cold or they are going to have to move somewhere colder or something just has to give. i do not know what to do about the bears but if they really require it to be 50 below all the time, how do these ones at the los angeles zoo even stand a chance? i mean it gets well into the 90's down there. i am really confused as to whether the kids finding out that everything is going to die is entertainment or info-tainment or guilt-trip-attainment. your kids will cry when they find out the bears are going to die. some bears die in the film and it is very, very sad--thankfully my youngest daughter and i were out taking a leak during the bear death sequence because it might have over-traumatized my little 4-year-old. i was not even sure whether or not to flush the toilet lest i kill yet another bear.

have these dire \" erotic \" soft core movies turning up late at night on bravo. this one follows a weird science type plot of a couple of college geeks building a virtual reality headset that makes you have sexual fantasies. when you`ve seen one of these movies you`ve seen them all with a bunch of bimbos looking like they`re advertising silicone implants. come on i`ve actually seen breasts in real life ( i`m sure some other of us have too ) and they wobble around unlike here where they defy the laws of , if not physics than at least gravity. the sex scenes are these tedious affairs where a well buffed geezer rubs himself against his co-star without any dialogue or sound apart from some muzak and when they climax it looks like they`re both having a bad attack of constipation. the girls

everything a chang cheh kung-fu movie should be, colorful, exciting, and full of fighting, fighting, fighting. they use all kinds of weapons in this one, from bamboo sticks to daggers, from swords to bladed disks... and there\\'s even one bad guy who has a magic sword that shoots bullets (or something like them) out of the end of the blade. so cool! if all that were not enough, this film has an evil femme fatale, who loves men\\'s guts... or stabbing them, anyway. unfortunately, my copy of the dvd is in chinese, with cantonese subtitles that will not change to english, so i guess that it\\'s

of a gritty punk-rock style. the documentary about the attempt to make the film and the subsequent betrayal of the film makers is very well detailed and easy to follow. the original film makers themselves become the main characters in the documentary version of the movie. the interviews of the film makers and the actors has been assembled in a highly entertaining story that illustrates the struggles involved in making the original film, the eventual failure of the original project and the phoenix-like rising from the ashes that evolved into this documentary film. in my mind the

why, when the marines figure out that armor-piercing bullets can hurt it, do they split up so the chupacabra can pick them off one by one? john rhys-davies gives a performance that rises above the bad

is as thin as clingfilm and is a rather poor homage to hitchcock's rear window (please note: regarded as something of a masterpiece by many). rear window works because we see everything from the main character's (jimmy stewart) perspective, namely the wheelchair, in his bedroom. everything the audience sees is from that vantage point. jimmy stewart's character is a helpless observer who plays no part in any activity outside his bedroom. this creates an atmosphere of claustrophobia and racks up the tension continuously. this reaches an unbearable point when he sees the murderer returning home to his apartment, which his girlfriend has just broken into, looking for evidence. this tension is created by the knowledge that stewart is powerless to warn or help her. the same scene is recreated in mimic: sentinel but is completely flat and offers us absolutely no tension whatsoever. there are various other nods to rear window which immediately tells us that the writers did not really have anything new or novel to say in this film. there are various plot elements that seem to do little other than fill in time (in a film which seems overly long at 78 minutes). for example when he attempts to report the danger to the police, his mother starts an intimate affair with the officer whom she had met briefly once before several years ago? then there is the kooky, doped up sister, who walks around flapping her arms all the time. the main character is too active to be the impotent character stewart plays but he's also too feeble to be a real hero character. leaving the rear window connection, there's very little rhyme or reason to the rest of the plot. no explanation is provided for many plot elements and very little motivation is given to any of the characters. it's all just an excuse for some atmospheric shots of not very scary giant insects dragging people off into the dark and some occasional shots of blood splatter. no attempt if made to create a feeling of impending dread as any real person would have in such a situation. none of the characters are in any way sympathetic and it's hard to get worked up enough to care about the film when we do not care about any of the characters. we are left with a film which lacks the substance of rear window and which fails to provide any substance of it's own. i would not bother spending money to rent it but if it's on tv

or perhaps reading the comments before watching made me expect much worse (that and i am not fat phobic). some scenes struck me as just right and way over done at the same time (the onanistic football watching scene is a perfect example, too much but there was something about it that i just loved). the comments here by spanish speakers that the acting was just atrocious made me realize how much can be forgiven when you do not speak the language of the film, but even i cringed at some of the performances. the scene in the countryside between marcos and his wife for example. ouch. during one scene we watch marcos walking, walking, walking through the countryside, with that dead look on his face. it would have been excruciatingly dull to watch but the landscape was breathtaking. like i said in the beginning, the photography saved this film for me. mexico city looks amazing in this film -

(i.e. from awkward glances at each other while waiting in line for movie tickets with their respective dates to a \"nervewrecking\" scene of dave struggling to call rafi after looking her up in the phone book.) the dates they go on seem unrealistic for a 37-year-old divorcée. (i.e. underground rap clubs.) all of the romance that is supposed to touch you and bring you closer to the characters really just pushes you away because the scenes presented are so hard to swallow. and you can not help but notice that their relationship is based on a large part on sex, which does not add any dimension to the characters or the story. perhaps this is why it is so hard to swallow anything when either rafi and dave claim that they love each other. because you can not help but think that they are merely infatuated with each other and this new experience and that it\\'s not really love at all. despite the fact that rafi insists to her therapist/dave\\'s mom that she is serious about this relationship, it is hard to believe because you see nothing that rafi and dave have in common besides art and even that link is iffy and seems tacked on just to draw some connection between them. younger never gives the characters real dimension or qualities that would make the audience draw towards them, so when the film ends, you do not feel the connection with the characters that is needed for the ending to be felt the way younger wants it to be felt. in other words, as you walk out of the theatre, you do not really care about rafi and dave just like the way you do not really care about two card-board cut outs. younger seems to focus too much on the topics that come to people easily when thinking about relationships with such a great age difference, such as one person who wants a baby while the other person wants the newest x-box game, etc.. the most cliché topics are touched on throughout the film, like being carded when buying liquor, playing video games instead of having sex, or being old enough to be his mother. if you add these topics and a few jewish jokes here and there, you have got yourself _prime_ wrapped neatly in a box. despite the film having its fair share of funny moments and tasteful humor, younger definitely could have explored this relationship on a deeper level and gave thurman and greenberg a little more to work with in terms of character development and dialogue. the failure to do this ultimately spoiled a perfectly good premise for a film. maybe better luck next time. and hopefully the next role uma picks will have a little more spice to it as it is always pleasant to see her on-screen, and she usually has better judgment.',\n"," \"demonic toys starts with two undercover cops judith gray (tracy scoggins) & matt cable (jeff weston) going undercover to arrest a couple of arms dealers lincoln (michael russo) &

script by david s. goyer who has since gone on to write massive hollywood films such as blade (1998), blade ii (2002), blade: trinity (2004), dark city (1998), batman begins (2005) & the upcoming ghost rider (2006) film was amongst his first & after this it's a wonder he was ever let near any of those films. the characters are extremely one dimensional, they have virtually no personality or background although having said that a one or two of them were sort of likable. demonic toys is about a demon trying to resurrect itself more than killer toys, this demon just uses them every once in a while to knock off one of the cast members. no explanation is given as to who this demon is or where he came from & goyer also throws in some of those annoying dream sequences & the demon taking the form of dead characters trying to trick those still alive, you know the sort of thing. i would also like to know how that killer teddy bear managed to grow to human sized proportions. demonic toys is clichéd & starts to become dull as it's easy to tell who's going to die & survive & it features no logic or sense whatsoever. technically demonic toys is cheap & nasty, the production design consists of placing lots of cardboard boxes with 'arcadia toys' written on them in each location & it becomes monotonous very quickly. there are various mistakes & errors & the special effects are generally poor except a rather good stop-motion animated toy soldier at the end. the music by richard band sounds like, but not as good, the theme from the far superior dolls (1987) which is not a surprise as band also scored that. the killer toys themselves lack imagination except the jack in the box who is the first toy to be killed anyway so do not expect to see a lot of him. the gore is tame & unconvincing apart from a reasonable decapitation, there are a few bites, a few gunshot wounds, a scene when someone pokes his own eyes out, someone is poked in the eye & someone has their fingers bitten off. the acting is ok for this sort of thing & both scoggins & the goofy mitchum make for pleasantly likable leads. overall the best thing thing i can about demonic toys is that i thought it

hindsight feminists seem intent on grabbing this movie as some sort of an anthem for the empowerment of women in a male - dominated society but i have serious doubts that either m.tourneur or miss

we? that is the core question behind this highly original and masterfully crafted examination of the illusionary nature of reality. blending eastern and buddhist philosophies with the visual chicanery of m.c. escher, this fascinating treatise manages to take on the rather cerebral question of `who are we and what is our place in the universe?', and turn it into a captivating and fun-filled 100 minutes. the film centers on bart, a writer struggling with his screenplay, `the sea that thinks.' as he sits at his computer, the work begins to unfold as nothing more than a description of his sitting at the computer, writing the screenplay. before long he is stuck in a whirling conundrum in which everything he writes becomes reality. director gert de graaff approaches his subject with an impish sense of humor and dazzles the viewer with a series of astounding visual tricks that confront the nature and validity of our perception. ultimately, de graaff's film challenges the audience at several levels to question whether anything we see or touch or taste is really what it appears to be, or whether our entire understanding of the universe and our place in it is merely a trick played on us by our senses. note: after you have seen the movie, check out the film's entertaining web site.

all the songs in the film are very satanic. the whole thing has a very dark feel about it. charlie spends a lot of time preaching or teaching as he would call it. he compares himself with richard nixon and discusses how \"everyone has lucifer inside of them\". the man really seems a mix of possessed and crazy to me. i did not really gain any understanding of why he did things that he did. i just got further proof that this person is exceptionally disturbed, not gifted as he thinks and as the film tries to persuade you. the film takes you to the famous spaun ranch and shows pictures of then and now. charlie tells stories of the ranch and explains how his \"world\" is still there. he goes on and on about how he does not live in our world, he is above and beyond us. our world and the united states is the devil, an evil machine. i have watched a lot of documentaries about killers and criminals, trying to figure out why someone would do the things that they do, how they must reason it in their mind. this is unlike anything i have ever seen. at times, it is very boring, at times unbelievable. i got a very creepy feeling while watching it and confess, i did not finish the whole film. i lost interest in listening to charlie rant and rave, he is clearly insane. all in all, you get a feeling of perhaps what his followers heard and saw from him. i bet that his story has not

think emilo did a wonderful job of directing this film. i agree with the previous comments from other views that this is the only movie that i have seen that has brought the war home and showed what a family had to go through, what a veteran went through. it is almost heart breaking to think that back then people just thought you could come home from a life changing experience and be the same person you were before you left. kathy bates reminded me of my mother in a way. i believe she really showed how women felt and acted back then. i am surprised that this film was not up for more

its location. the film is set in pensacola, florida, and does not try to avoid saying so. that's a bold move in the film world today, and a rare treat for fans of indy films. and indeed, it may not be the last. pensacola is world renowned as a navy town, an aviation town, a lumber town, and sometimes even as a hotbed for political controversy. rarely is it seen as a growing film town. but that's all changing now. more film companies are coming in to shoot. and more native pensacolians are discovering the power of cinema for themselves. this film is part of a growing trend of pensacola-based

prisoner of war camp of that name. the story cuts between past events, and the present day, when the aged veterans plan a reunion. this is a much publicised and controversial miniseries, here in australia. the budget ran over ($6.5 million aust. dollars); historians and veterans criticised it\\'s authenticity; and critics pilloried the uneasy mix of comedy and drama (shades of \"pearl harbor\"). series writer john doyle (half of the successful roy & h.g. comedy team), has tried to defend himself with comments about \"the characters are composites of actual people\"; \"the troops used comedy to cope with the situation\"; \"it\\'s only based on actual events\"; \"one of our actors was actually there\" etc. i do not have a problem with any of these points. many superb fictional and factual dramas have come out of the japanese p.o.w. camp experience: \"king rat\", \"tenko\", \"merry christmas mr. lawrence\", \"bridge on the river kwai\", \"paradise road\", \"empire of the sun\", \"blood oath\", and \"a town like alice\". black comedy has often been used successfully in p.o.w dramas: \"life is beautiful\", \"the great escape\", \"seven beauties\", \"stalag 17\", \"the colditz story\", and even \"hogan\\'s heroes\". so why is \"changi\" a monumental failure? - the acting in \"changi\" is uniformly excellent, the music and cinematography is good - it is the writing and direction that have let it down. every scene seemed to give me waves of deja vu. when anthony hayes is made to stand in the blazing sun, i thought \"did not i see alec guinness do this in \"bridge on the river kwai\"?\". the sudden flashes into surreal song & dance brought back dennis potter\\'s \"singing detective\", but without the finesse. this borrowing happened so often, it smacked of lazy writing by cut and paste, rather than homage. the constant intercutting between the past and present stories left me unable to concentrate on either. flash forward and flash back can be a useful tool - here it left me distanced from characters, where intensity was called for. the \"ausiness\" is overdone - every conversation seemed to include \"stone the bloody crows\" & such, that i was saying \"i get the point, i know they are aussies\". cultural stereotyping extended to the british and japanese too -sadistic young japanese officer; uptight british officer; wiser japanese commandant; fun-loving, rascally aussies etc. i thought i was watching \"hogan\\'s heroes on the river kwai\". after 3 episodes i am tuning out.',\n"," 'even without speaking a word, billy connely is wonderful as

we speak exactly the same language as in holland, so why should not we understand it?) is certainly not the most original movie, but it is great fun for a night out with some friends. if you are a fan of the french movies taxi, taxi 2 and taxi 3, than this is definitely another movie that you should see. in this movie we follow bennie, a fat, women hating snack bar owner who has been in jail for a failed robbery on a jeweler\\'s shop. when he gets out of jail he finds out that his foster father mast is dying and that there are only two options to save him. one is the liver of a person with the same blood type or even better a relative, the other option is an operation in bolivia, but that will cost an enormous amount of money. mast tells bennie that he has a son of his own called koen, who has to spend his time in a belgian jail. it is his last wish to see him once again before dying. this gives bennie an idea. he\\'ll get his half brother out of jail, kill him and bring his liver to the hospital so his foster dad can be helped with it. but when the time has come to kill koen, bennie can not do it anymore, because he started to like koen too much. so now they have only one option: commit some crimes to raise money and save for the trip to south america. the acting is ok. the belgian as well as the dutch actors all did a very good job, even though i never expected to see some of them in this kind of movie (for instance kurt rogiers an peter van den begin). the story is nice, although it sometimes fails a bit when it wants to offer \"too much story\". this kind of movies does not need as much story as it needs action and jokes and that\\'s where it sometimes went a bit wrong. and you better do not expect to see the most original movie either, because than this will be one big disappointment. this movie has been made with only one intention and that is to make as much fun as possible and to keep the audience laughing at regular times. and that\\'s exactly where this movie has succeeded. it does make you laugh, especially during the car chase (in my opinion that\\'s one of the most hilarious scenes in the movie). i really liked what i saw and i give it a 7.5/10.',\n"," 'according to this masterpiece of film-making\\'s script (pun intended), charles darwin was full of nonsense when he presented his evolution theory, because he made absolutely no

that chupacabras are a typically puerto rican phenomenon, so i do not really know where that fits in. are they saying all puerto ricans are aliens? whatever, it\\'s all pretty irrelevant anyway. the only thing you need to memorize is that \"el chupacabre\" is an utterly cheap and imbecilic amateur b-movie, lacking tension, character development and any form of style. several duos of people are chasing this goat-munching monster (remotely resembling the midget version of the pumpkinhead demon) through the streets and ghettos of an ugly city. we have an untalented dogcatcher and a nagging female novelist, a pair of obnoxious cops and the supposedly evil scientist with his dim-witted accomplice. since they all are extremely incompetent in what they do, the monster can carelessly carry on devouring all the latino immigrants of the neighborhood. the monster itself looks okay and the make-up effects on his victims\\' leftovers are acceptably gross and bloody. the acting performances are irredeemably awful and headache inducing. particularly eric alegria is pitiable in his first and only lead role as the overly ambitious employee of animal control. yes, it\\'s an incredibly stupid

the characters in nude for satan spend plenty of time nude. for satan. probably more than in any other film i have seen short of hardcore porn. and every time they do, you\\'ll probably want to shout out, \"nude for satan!\" \\'cause it\\'s just that much fun to say. try it, you\\'ll like it. \"nude for satan. nuude for satan. i am nude for satan!\" see? of course, there\\'s a bit more to it than that; there is a plot, kinda. our hero, dr. william benson, happens upon an unconscious woman who crashed her car on a lonely highway in the middle of the night. seeking medical attention for her, he is directed by a very odd man to an isolated castle, and from that point on, things start to get very strange. the two get separated, and william ends up getting distracted by evelyn, a dead ringer for the car-crash woman who dresses in period clothing (when she\\'s not nude for satan), calls him peter, and is hot for his bod. the crash victim, whose name is susan, ends up spending time with a variety of people including their enigmatic host, an unnamed female servant, the leering, gap-toothed butler (or should i say, handyman?), and william\\'s doppleganger, peter. both william and susan are fairly creeped out by the goings-on in the castle, but do not really start trying to figure things out or get away until they meet back up when susan is menaced by a giant, and apparently quite horny, spider. then our host explains to william that peter and evelyn are the repressed, dark sides of dr. will and susan, and then william witnesses a bizarre ritual where susan and evelyn merge and make out with peter while various nude and semi-nude people dance around, apparently (you guessed it) for satan. alas, will\\'s will proves too strong for the dark side to claim him as well, and he escapes, only to find himself back at the site of the original car accident. if you think it all sounds rather confusing so far, keep in mind that, for the sake of brevity and comprehension, i have left out most of the really weird aspects of the film in the above summary. no, really. but the most interesting thing about nude for satan is that it appears that this film was a major influence on the rocky horror picture show. we have got an innocent, upstanding couple, who find themselves stranded in a castle after experiencing car troubles, and are gradually seduced to a life of vice and debauchery by its bizarre inhabitants. there\\'s a bedroom scene that matches janet\\'s breakdown (\"but you did!\") right down to the heavily blue- and red-gelled lighting. and the clincher comes at the end, when peter and susalyn exactly mirror frank and columbia\\'s little frolic on the throne in rhps\\'s ballroom scene, immediately followed by what could certainly be called a \"floor show.\" all in all, pretty much a must-see for the serious cult-movie fan. say it with me again - \"nude for satan.\" hee. that never gets old.',\n"," 'think a darker version of one of those kid shows such as \"power rangers\" and you have this film from 1990, \"robot jox\". a movie where you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena and whoever comes out their country wins. the robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of the ones from said shows mainly because they are less colorful so while this movie is not good, it is not all bad to watch. there are as i recall two robot fights in this one, one that ends badly and the final showdown. there is a plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed, but in the end the plot is nothing that is going to stick with you for any amount of time after the picture is done. the fights themselves look like giant toys on the rampage, but still somewhat fun to watch. this movie would also spawn a couple of other films with similar plot devices such as the giant robots and the tournament. so it is worth checking out once, but probably not more than that.',\n"," 'this movie is widely acknowledged as being one of the worst sequels ever. it\\'s the same movie all over again, but without the intelligence, humour and charm that made the first film such a winner. eddie murphy returns as fish-out-of-water cop axel foley and he\\'s at his loudest and most annoying here, shouting at the top of his lungs and speaking so fast that it\\'s difficult to understand what he\\'s saying (nutty professor 2 had the same problem, with those two and \"another 48 hours\" eddie seems to make a mess of sequels). director tony scott was hired to direct the sequel. he was hot off \"top gun\" the year before, but he\\'s not a comedy director. he gives \"beverly hills cop ii\" his usual glossy look, but he mistimes all of the humour and it shows. you can tell a movie franchise is in trouble when it starts killing off its main characters and that\\'s what happens here when ronny cox is shot (foley\\'s foul-mouthed boss, inspector todd, would be killed off in the next movie). brigitte nielsen, for the 5 minutes she was on hollywood\\'s a-list, is in among the cast. she only got the part after sylvester stallone invited eddie murphy over for dinner (sly apparently fell under the table laughing at eddie\\'s rocky impression). the screenplay for \"beverly hills cop\" was nominated for an oscar and that just goes to show you how good the original movie was. this movie got no such recognition. actor and director mel smith once saw this movie at a royal premiere in london and he said: \"that is the biggest load of cr*p you will ever sit through in your life, i would have left, but you could not as there was royalty there.\" i could not agree more. you should only watch this film at gunpoint. otherwise, do not waste 2 hours of your life that you will not get back.',\n"," 'this film is so bad and gets worse in every imaginable fashion. its not just the poor acting and script nor is it the lame and perverse time one wastes on watching it. what really puts this film in my hall of shame is the apparent struggling that the writers and producers do with the film to try and make it funny. the actress replacing jean reno\\'s descendant is to old and learned her lesson in the first film so they add a new girl who is to be married. nearly all of the original extras and gags return however this time makes me want to ripe my eyes out of my sockets because it\\'s a waste of perfectly good film. the torture of the constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer into violent convolutions. this second film takes the successful original and drags it out of its coffin and parades the corpse out in the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its legacy but our intelligence as well. this film unlike the spruce goose could not fly for it had no plot in the principals returning for a \\'necklace\\'. no script since it was apparently written and added to daily. no attention to camera or shots in mind. poor lighting and special effects done for the sake of doing so. this film would not even pass for a student film in basic film 101. how this pile got through no one can tell. it was a big loosing investment and it appears that no one had the strength to put this unnatural cruel mistake out of our miseries. this movie has one good part... its end! this film is my #1 worst film of all time, finally \"howard the duck\" is no longer the goose.',\n"," 'for me the sequels to \"dirty harry\" never came close topping the original, but i thoroughly enjoyed and think highly of them anyway... well maybe with the exception of \"the dead pool\". each one seemed to add its own distinguishable touch to the typical formula. the third film (and probably the cheapest, as it looks like it) of the series \\'the enforcer\\' seemed to have that swinging and carefree vibe of the times, with the biting reality and stark realisations (heavily implemented in the first two) taking a backseat for forceful (if crass) humour. however the violence is still gritty, mean, explosive and openly displayed. director james fargo (\\'forced vengeance\\', \\'every which way but loose\\', \\'caravans\\' and \\'a game for vultures\\') has appeared in some of eastwood\\'s early films as assistant director, and here he paces it well-enough and let\\'s the foundation play out more like an expansive low-key action fling filled with the constant buddy routines (as harry is paired up with a young green-horn female detective fidgety played by tyne daly. who does bring an authentic and potent side to her role) that are credibly developed, long-winded build-ups finishing off with brute force and the quick-witted response. harry also has got a catch-phrase just \\'marvellous\\'. eastwood laconically pulls it off with dominant ease and certain authority of truly delving into this character (as now there\\'s more to that monomaniacal search for one\\'s own justice), as his hands out punishment (against a bunch of terrorists who call themselves \\'the people\\'s revolutionary\\') and has time to let fly what he really thinks. copping the cynical barbs are amusing support performances by harry guardino, john crawford and bradford dillman. the bad guys here are not overly memorable, but the deveren bookwalter bestows a steely glance and has a quietly dangerous psychotic air to him. showing up again, but in another different character is the wonderful albert popwell. i never tire of the san francisco locations (where most of the films are shot), and the camera superbly details the on-screen action and striking background features. what i like about the ending of these earlier \\'dirty harry\\' films, was how they were not afraid to end on such an powerful note involving something represented visually to express the mindset, as the camera slowly zooms out and the harrowing score cues in. on the point about the music. i would say i was a little put off by the racy and bouncy jazz score arrangement of composer jerry fielding (who by-the-way has done some magnificent scores for films of sam peckinpah, michael winner and clint eastwood) just did not have the stinging, sombre and self-reflecting quality of lalo schifrin\\'s efforts. that\\'s not to say it was bad or felt out of place, because it did not with the feel that this one opted for. but a darker or more subtle take could have done it wonders since fielding has chalked up some jarringly bold pieces in other films. the script has some political context (home-grown terrorism, political correctness and equal-gender opportunity), but always stays true to the story than trying to undermine or overdo it. while it should be predictable, it does keep one step ahead and offers a surprise or two. an up-to-par sequel.',\n"," 'i am a filmmaker and i was amazed at how they put this movie together with the chimps. i have done one very short short called \"giant mice from outer space\" (youtube and veoh) with cats, ducks, dogs and deer and it took forever. the cinematography is perfect. the performances were very good considering this was tongue in cheek. i particularly liked robbie benson\\'s performance. this is a great movie kids will love and i suspect the low score here may be due to animal activists who feel chimps should not snowboard. parents should just be warned that you kid(s) will probably say, \"can i get a snowboard momma? it can not be hard monkeys can do it.\"',\n"," \"the storyline of this movie is very ordinary and hard to believe in. also, while showing the time lapse the director has neither taken enough care to show the discoloration of or changes in the sets used on the location, nor has he changed the make-ups of different actors who have aged by at least 10 years. the songs have just been inserted to 'showcase' the acrobatic 'talent' of one of the lead actresses. a repetition of such showcasing has made the movie very boring. the acting and dialog delivery of many actors does not seem to come out naturally, but rather seems to be forced out. enough attention has not been given while writing the screenplay which has made it a very slow-moving storyline.\",\n"," 'i like this movie,

fiction stuff as well. this is the best of the series for me. the later editions just try to explain too much... i always thought it was best to leave it unexplained and mysterious. this movie definitely is both of those things... though the plot is a little hard to follow at times.',\n"," 'i have no words to really describe this series. the premise behind this concept (a highly hyperactive girl with a very eccentric personality which ends up whirling up a team of oddballs into her own rendering of the world, which after all was a creation of haruhi, since she wants a world with aliens, espers and time travelers) is a breath of fresh air in a world ridden with repetitive anime series and non innovative tv shows. characters are well developed, and you will end up loving them, some less than others. the word to describe the animation job does not exist, since \"excellent\" would really fall short to describe how was done. there are many funny situations which either will make you smile or put you into deep thoughts. do not fall for the impression of the first episode, since that\\'s only the tip of the iceberg, as the novels are yet to come. the only problem comes due to the lack of chronological order in the episodes, but you can solve that problem, no? conclusion: unquestionably, one of the best series of 2006.',\n"," 'there was a stylish approach to this film on the part of director vincenzo natali with interesting camera angles and effective close-ups. it was also refreshing to see jeremy northam and lucy liu given leading roles and expanding their range as performers. this film also included one of the most imaginative \"escape\" scenes in recent years. the efforts of the director and the actors combined in an effective thriller. although the plotting of the film was convoluted, the story progressed very clearly as the layers of corporate greed and skullduggery were revealed. in 1949, george orwell suggested in his famous novel \"1984\" that the future would be ruled by the totalitarian state, which would control minds and diminish human liberty. it was interesting that in this intriguing futuristic film, it was not the state, but rather the corporate world that controlled and devalued the human worker.',\n"," \"five deadly venoms is not as bloody and violent as story of ricky or super ninjas, but it features some of the best hand-to-hand

beautiful films directed by eytan fox. the movie presents the story of star-crossed lovers (one israeli, one palestinian)in modern tel aviv. the film's effectiveness comes not only from its depiction of cross-ethnic conflict, but of conflicts personal and political within ethnic groups as well. for example, there's a telling moment when one of the secondary characters, openly gay, is visited in the hospital by his boyfriend who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family, and suddenly we see a wave of awkward discomfort wash through the room. clearly the young man is not as open as he seems, and the family not as accepting as he might want them to be, while the boyfriend is confused and rejected. a good deal of complexity is packed into a fleeting moment. as we know from yossi & jagger, fox is a master at efficiently packing emotional and psychological complexity into brief sequences. the film is also effective for the even-handed way it presents the mutual brutalities that israelies and palestinians inflict on each other. if you are not heartless, you'll cry through the last third of the movie. though the plot is melodramatic, it's so

not what you could call something successful but this movie, that was shot at the same time as this previously mentioned movie, is even worse comedy-wise, story-wise and whatever more wise. this movie was obviously intended as an attempt to put new life into the pink panther series, after the death of peter sellers in 1980. the movie picks a new main character but keeps the same cast and crew of the previous more successful and better pink panther movies. so basically it\\'s made in the same way as those other successful earlier pink panther movies but never does this movie work out as good as any other pink panther movie and it also is definitely the worst out of the long running series of movies. problem is that this movie really does not follow a script. appereantly there is a main plot-line involving the pink panther again and clouseau who is presumed missing. a new york cop is brought in to try and find clouseau by picking up his trail he was on while investigation the disappearance of the pink panther. it basically starts off were \"trail of the pink panther\" had ended, making this a direct sequel. do not be fooled by this movie its cast list people. basically everywhere ted wass is listed somewhere like the 10th actor but he really actually plays the main lead within this movie. actors such as david niven, robert wagner, robert loggia and burt kwouk who are all listed higher are in it for like 10 minutes maximum. the reason they must have put david niven on top of the billing must be done for commercial reasons or perhaps they were just being kind for him, knowing already how terminally ill at the time of making this movie he was. they even had to dub his voice, since he was not able to speak up good enough anymore. this was also the last movie he appeared in before his death. so main lead is ted wass. who? exactly! he is one big nobody, without a real talent for acting or comedy. what was blake edwards when he casted him? was he seriously thinking this would be the man that would be able to make us forget peter sellers? he is the type of actor that needs screaming and big surprised eyes to come across as being funny. he\\'s too forced in his acting. also his character is supposed to be like the american version of clouseau but instead of being clumsy or stupid, he more comes across as a victim of unlikely circumstances. he never really gets himself into trouble because of his own stupidity like clouseau always did. it just is not a very funny or well made movie. it tries to follow a story but it just looks as if the movie simply does not bother sticking to it. appereantly it\\'s about the search for clouseau but really, does he ever seriously attempt looking for him? he just randomly questions people and travels around the world. to me the movie gets still somewhat saved by the roger moore cameo. he actually shows that he has a great talent for comedy and actually would had been a worthy new chief insp. jacques clouseau for future movies in my opinion. oh well, he probably was too expensive at the time to cast him for further pink panther, plus he of course at the time was still committed to playing james bond, so no way they would had allowed him to play a different \\'cop\\' in a different comedy movie series. also the presence of herbert lom and burt kwouk and other pink panther regulars, as well as

collaborator simonetti (through his various bands goblin, demonian and solo effort) compliments the screen action with zeal as his score touches from the classical (verdi) to metal musings (with a

interpreter at times does not seem to explain monsieur godard\\'s questions (ramblings) very well. there is a distinct sense of woody allen being vaguely bamboozled by it all. at one point, godard brings up a point, posited somewhat eccentrically, about cultural overload stifling original creativity: godard refers to it as \"cultural radioactivity\" disgorged upon us by tv. but because of the rambling nature of his question, the context regarding tv, and the bumblings of the interpreter, woody misunderstands and takes it as literally referring to cathode tube radiation from the television set. it\\'s all kind of embarrassing. and also unfortunate, because what would have been an interesting question is then quickly brushed over. perhaps this was all godard\\'s intention. perhaps he\\'s saying something about communication. perhaps that\\'s why some of his inter-titles do not seem to make much sense. i do not know. what i do know is, if you want to learn about woody allen and his

any further now. i already guess most readers are older than the two protagonists of this picture, so i should say ponyo is not so much a family film as a chance to remember the feeling of being a small child: discovering the world as you wanted to see it, making up your own rules and boasting an exuberant enthusiasm at doing things on your own for the first time. ponyo swerves away from many of the problems that all-age films tackle. it never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems. the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen. they are not simple minded, arrogant or naive, just curious, enthusiastic and learning the ways of the world. they are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with. many films regard children from the outside, as the adult looking into a world only a child could enter. ponyo brings everyone back to that world. in ponyo, there lies the first time to learn and choose what you care about most, which the film values with high esteem. it is worth it to remember, to feel it again.\",\n"," \"i did not know what to expect when i decided to watch this documentary.

in itself, but what sets this film apart from other biography-type docs is that dieter himself tells most of the story himself. dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. his personality really shines. he tells his story about his life growing up in germany during wwii and the hardships. we are there with him in that same small town as he describes his family, inspirations, and struggles. we follow him to america and his path to fulfilling his dream to be a pilot. then later dieter describes his story of capture, escape, and survival in the laotian jungle. we are again with him in that very jungle as he describes and re-enacts his imprisonment and path to freedom with great detail. we see the same primitive huts, villagers, and forms of detainment he dealt with that

played, was truly a magical combination, a high point with even more high points to come! just what was it that made this movie so funny and so enjoyable? was it the swash buckling washed out alan swann (played by peter o\"toole) as he moved from one situation after another? or was it benjy stone (mark linn-baker) as he tried unsuccessfully to keep swann out of trouble, only to wind up becoming an involuntary accomplice to swann\\'s wild schemes, and realizing that he was actually enjoying himself, having every bit as much fun as swann? maybe it was king kaiser (joseph bologna), with his outrageous outbursts and unreasonable demands. king kaiser\\'s writing staff with those connivers, ready to tell their boss off, only to turn into a team of cowardly \"yes-men\", the moment he showed up, is worth its weight in gold. maybe it was the performance of cameron mitchell as karl rojeck as he had that face off with king kaiser? come to think of it, the correct answer here is \"all of the above\"! it was sad, though, to see selma diamond, with that cigarette dangling out of her mouth, knowing that within 3 years, her smoking would turn her into the \"late selma diamoind\" as lung cancer would claim yet another life. the use of equipment used in the late 1950s as opposed to equipment used in 1954, is on little or no relevance unless you have been working in a television studio since the early 1950s. while a lot of work was put into the styles and fashions of the time, leaving no detail overlooked, i could not help noticing that some of the men wore their hair a little too

paris that is inhabited by first-generation jewish immigrants--most of them from north africa. the muslim-hebrew conflict has apparently been transported to france, where each group is suspicious of--and hostile towards--the other. two jewish sisters are trapped in conflicts. the older, mathilde (elsa zylberstein), is a wife and mother residing in a modern, developed country, but still living under marital rules and customs brought from her native tunisia. she realizes that there are problems in her marriage, but does not know where to turn for help. seeking formal therapy would be out of the question. instead, she receives counseling from the attendant at the mikva--the ritual bath. (this pivotal supporting role is portrayed beautifully by aurore clément. another brilliant supporting actor is sonia tahar, who plays the girls\\' mother.) the part of the younger sister, laura, is played by fanny valette. laura is a brilliant philosophy student who works at night as a cleaner at a school. she falls in love with a young co-worker from the muslim community, with predictably problematic results. this film could not be more timely--as i write this review, the immigrant communities in france (primarily muslim), have risen in revolt against what they perceive as discrimination and prejudice against them within french society. being an immigrant can never be easy. what makes it so hard is portrayed very well in this movie. la petite jérusalem offers a glimpse of a world most of us will never know. the district is not very attractive, and it\\'s certainly off the beaten path for tourists. the people who live in petite jérusalem have to cope as best they can. this film shows how they go about this precarious balancing act. it\\'s a wonderful movie, and is definitely worth seeking out.

the one specific scene that i am talking about is the near riot. the other problem i had with this movie was the overuse of latino terms. i understand that these terms are used in real life but every other word was \"essay\"(sp) or \"homes\". this would not have been such an issue if the movie at least had some action between long drawn out conversations. the action was few and far between and i found myself dozing off many times. the thing that bothered me with this movie was the lack of a score. there was little to no background music to set the tone of a scene. this left the movie with a ton of awkward silences with the actors standing just making a silly facial expression for minutes at a time. so if you are looking for an action filled drug movie i\\'d look elsewhere but if you are looking for a way to waste 2 hours of your day i\\'d recommend \"american me\".',\n"," \"actually i caught this movie on tv as i was about to go to bed, and it grabbed me immediately. sure, it's

disorientating, colder, more high pitched: its clashing colors dominated by the piercing fuschia red, but sometimes slanting off towards yellows, or sepias and soft blues. in european terms it's like seeing the paintings of pontormo and bronzino - a mannerist palette on film. there is, i imagine a lot of filtering and digital enhancement here. it's self-conscious but no more so than any consistent vision has to be. so the color comes first. immediately, you are pitched in an alternative reality of westerns (sergio leone mixed with zorro) and romances, but comic as the 'western' scenes are, these are not merely 'cool' parodies. the style everywhere refers to memory, of period, of genre: if it is irony it is a strange poignant irony in the service of poetry. the palette changes with the genre, as does the framing. parts of it are presented as scenes in theaters. the story is simple enough but acute in its balance of belief and distance. it makes sense as an adult take on the feel of childhood. i thought it marvelously original, funny and alarming. oh far far far better than the vastly cerebral greenaway whose work might make a reasonable aesthetic analogy.\",\n"," \"even though

actual film clips from the newsreels shown in theaters at that time together with contemporary filmed drama in script written by david w. rintels and crafted and directed by joseph sargent. this film allows us to revisit history the way it was - with more behind the scenes activity among the great powers than most other films offer. the roaring lions are very well portrayed by john lithgow as franklin delano roosevelt, bob hoskins as winston churchill and michael caine as stalin. each actor steps wholly into his role without resorting to mimicry or simply stage makeup. it is fascinating to see how the usa was a non-intervener at first (a refreshingly different stance form the current aggressor role we have adopted) and how the needs of the planet required global cooperation in the face of hitler et al. ed begley jr. offers a lot of information about the important figure harry hopkins about whom we hear little as does jan triska as vyacheslav molotav, stalin's key man. the

the complexity of the characters not fitting into obvious stereotypes. paul appears uneasy in the office environment, is it that he's just not cut out for work? this belief is dispelled when he gets a job in a bar and shines. the film has a certain amorality which i find refreshing and showed how easy is to act criminally, even if we think it is harmless or justified. finally, it is a film full of

a guy squeezing a rotten apple, and a \"mad hatter\\'s\" tea party. the lighting is non-existent... many \"scenes\" take place in semi or complete darkness, which is probably just as well. the

worth and equality (remember the episode where the tv announcer says \"just a housewife\") and donna stands up for all women do and represent, especially those that do not work outside the home? and when the women rebelled against something in the series, it was not something trivial... it was always something to show that women have the right to be treated with the same respect as men. remember, donna reed was married to the show\\'s producer, so she had much more input into making hers a more powerful character. the children were intelligent, but not precocious. they were normal kids. and they could act. something else that made donna reed show stand out was not only did the children look like their parents, but you could feel the chemistry between all the actors in the real life situation, which then came out in the characters. shelly fabares and paul peterson have often written and remarked that they were treated like the children of donna reed and carl betz, and that the adults were fiercely protective of the child actors, and treated them accordingly. donna and alex also had somewhat of a sexual chemistry that was not seen on the other family shows. and the characters could be flawed, and in major ways, and yet, accepted for the flaws and mistakes. these were not super parents that did no wrong and had no emotional highs and lows. they were normal people acting as normal people. women\\'s rights, drug abuse, child abuse, single fathers, poverty, children who need good health care but can not afford it... it was all shown on this show. pretty groundbreaking for the era. donna reed show did not last for eight years without a reason. and it could have possibly endured, had it not been for tony owens and donna reed divorcing. this show is highly underrated and should be shown so that other generations can appreciate quality. in summary, i agree with the original poster, who obviously cares for the show, but i think that the donna reed

re-read it, i can only give you my impressions from the past - but i am sure of one thing - the film is a paean to family life, whereas in the book, almost all traditional institutions - including, and perhaps especially, marriage - are shown to be strait-jackets that we would be well rid of. the only positive in the book is the wondrous nature of children... something that only the very beginning and ending of the film really captures (with that incredibly gorgeous baby floating in the air. too bad williams does not have a tenth of his charm!) my low mark is therefore from the fact that the film misrepresents the book. as a film on its own it fares better - but only for a few key performances. mary beth hurt is wonderful - i think anyone watching it would fall in love with her. and john lithgow as an ex football player who has had a sex-change operation is fantastic... he never once camped it up or made the character anything but commendable - and as such his performance had an incredibly integrity. i watched him closely during all of his scenes, and never once was he anything except womanly. nothing in his performance ever came near the performance of a drag queen... and that made all the difference. in fact, of all the people in the film, his is the only one which is irreproachable. it is worth seeing this film only for his performance.',\n"," 'i have to say this is

making a revolution. whatever, nowadays we need idealism more than ever, we need to believe in lost causes, we have to appeal to the dignity of the individual and to spit in the riches\\' faces. \"the edukators\" is one way of doing all those things from the cinema screen by telling the story of three rebel young guys that will not stay and look without doing a thing while the big corporations destroy this world and turn us into working-hard zombies. they have an idea: to assault mansions, mess everything up, to make trouble just to scare the owners... not to steal, not to break things. it is all about disconcerting. obviously their \"game\" will soon get out of hand, they\\'ll get involved in a kidnapping, and they will bump into something that\\'s more powerful than revolution or

slightly scary scene(for a squirrel)near the end,but everything was okay in a few minutes.of course,since the squirrels in the recent willy wonka movie attacked the little girl,he did not like that

\"eric\" set off the grenade, why did smoke come out of only the top floor window, when it was blown off ground level? 14.) bloody bill apparently did not have to do that much. he spent 95% of his time simply standing there. 15.) gwen sensed something was wrong with the \"eric\" in cowboy attire coming towards them, yet she continued to simply stand there, why? 16.) bloody bill can tele-transport from place to place- so why did not he locate himself into the little tiny room they were hold up in? 17.) the end was a total ripoff of the friday the 13th\\'s, when someone pretended

hyper-frenetic and luridly self-congratulatory, but then the \"come-down\" happens. and when it comes, it hits hard. i did some follow-up research. ironically, this documentary gave annabel chong the financial rewards that her gang-bang did not, and she earned enough to buy a house and return to college. she is currently completing a course in web-design/networking. she appears to be earning her living by operating a website that combines her discussions of windows 2000 installations with subscriber-only pornographic photos of herself and others. like the film itself, this historical footnote

have motion that tcm made this reconstruction that gives a loose idea of what the plot was like. this reconstruction gives us more or less a taste of what this picture might have looked like on the screen but i think tcm failed to understand the allure of london after midnight. most chaney fans accept the fact that london after midnight received poor to lukewarm reviews but chaney\\'s make-up and characterization through the photos we have left have left us fascinated. the chaney fan in me wants the much better film the miracle man to be found but the kid in me wants london after midnight. this make-up is some of the best in film history, i argue that the vampire in london after midnight is chaney\\'s finest make-up and the picture has not been seen by mainstream audiences in 80 years. i can tell that the best people were involved with this reconstruction of the picture and that they meant well but inevitably people will be disappointed. london after midnight without action is exactly what it has been all along, lifeless. the fact that all we have left are these still photographs does not quench our thirst in the least bit, it makes us even thirstier. i know lon chaney\\'s characterization and performance must have been fascinating and when we see that outstanding make-up in a narrative fashion we want to see it move with life. browning\\'s sense of the macabre and the atmosphere of terror are all too ingrained in what we have left. the finished product? it\\'s actually watchable, i know a lot of people complain about reconstructions but i thought this one was okay. the narrative is pretty much intact even when they have trouble finding images for scenes. the crew even gives us some seldom seen photos which show the supporting cast give some interesting interpretations of their characters. my favorite thing about this production was the score which is outstanding, very dark and foreboding and much like what this film probably was scored with in the 1920\\'s. as for the plot, i\\'ll put my money that many people would be disappointed if london after midnight was found because they did not grasp the plot. tod borwning\\'s 1935 remake mark of the vampire is in essence a faithful remake and it has been panned for it\\'s \"fake vampires\". chaney plays a scottland yard detective named burke who uses hypnosis and fear to try to find the murderer of roger balfour. burke is in fact the vampire who haunts the balfour mansion, he plans to scare the killer into a confession. not many people like the plot after reading it and seeing this reconstruction, i do. chaney is playing something he seldom got to play, a smart man and a hero at that. is the plot a little far fetched? undoubtedly so but this is tod browning we are talking about here with lon chaney in the lead role. with the atmosphere and a great performance by chaney i have no doubt that this film could have been good even great. the loss of london after midnight is all the more tragic because it is the crucial representation of how badly the studios took care of their films in the early days of motion pictures. lon chaney was without a doubt one of the best actors who ever lived and yet less than 50% of his filmography is left to judge him with. if you want london after midnight to be found donate to film preservation programs. i hope and pray that london after midnight is found in some dusty old attic one day but until then this is what we have and i applaud tcm for trying to satisfy the fans who mourn the loss of burnt nitrate from mgm;s vault 7.',\n"," 'i

arguably, his best film. i was also intrigued at the fact it was a talkie; my first one, chaplin-wise. the start is typical chaplin and blatant proof that when it comes to sound, chaplain can cut it whilst not solely relying on music to set mood and to do the talking; it's funny, well timed and the elements of slapstick such as falling off an anti-aircraft gun are well tied in with the jokes. it was good to draw the viewer in with this 'classic chaplin' opening and at the same time, kick start the narrative of characters getting to know one another. what was also well done was the way in which hitler is spoofed. any scene involving hitler or 'hynkel' in this film, was funny and even now; makes you think back as you know exactly who he's spoofing and does create an internal reaction of some kind. the way in which english in mixed in with the mock german during the dialogue scenes is further proof of the way chaplin managed to adapt to the talkie era. my favourite joke was the five minute speech hynkel gave, only for the english translator to translate it into a mere few words; making you think back to footage of hitler you may have seen giving a speech at some point in your life and, indeed, laugh at him. historically, the film got a few things right as well. hynkel is seen getting his photograph taken with children; something hitler did for recognition as he manipulated the media but here, hynkel is seen to yawn and act bored; stabbing at hitler's underhand technique of winning over the german public through sympathy (oh, he hugs and kisses children. he must be ok!). the film is also given a fantastic premise of a jewish civilian reinstalled into the ghetto amongst all the travesties going on but with the catch that he is oblivious. films such as 'the pianist' and 'come and see' are two good examples of nazi cruelty towards 'inferior' people which nowadays, we can all look back on and shake our heads at whereas back in the late 1930's when this was filmed, the fact he had the cruelty going on and was exploiting it makes it even more an astounding achievement. chaplin has managed to replace guns and truncheons for tomatoes and saucepans and still pulls it off. what i did not like about the film, however, was the fact it settled into an actual narrative after the opening. this slowed the film up and this is very noticeable as the foot was taken off the gas somewhat. the film started to hint at stories and sub-stories. these included the barber and the female neighbour falling in love and the supposed destruction of hynkel's palace whereas none of these were actually developed. the 'giving a woman a shave' and the 'whoever has the coin in their pudding does the deed' gags were hinting at these plot paths but in the end, just materialised into nothing but excuses for drawn out, unfunny gags which was disappointing. during the final straight, the great dictator gets a boost from the fact the italian dictator is introduced who adds some much needed life and excuse for comedy to the film. it works a treat as we see them argue and more underhand tactics are exploited when hynkel attempts to 'overpower' his italian counterpart through a series of dirty tricks (although, they are humorously foiled). despite a few weaknesses in pacing during the middle segment and the fact i felt the message at the end was a little forced down my throat, the great dictator holds up for viewing today but that's only because he took the gamble of exploiting things nobody else really knew were there.\",\n"," '**spoilers** a hot and sexy linda

made this conclusion after a whopping 15 minutes of watching). but i can truly say that fire is also one of the really beautiful and brilliant films i have seen. beautiful because of its imagery. the best example i can give is the parallelism between the 2 female leads(radha and sita) and the characters of the same name in hindu mythology. sita, for example, is the wife of the revered lord ram. as legend goes, ram subjugates his wife by making her walk through a fire to prove her `purity.' sita, in response, cries and leaves him, reuniting with her mother(the earth). this story has all sort of crazy links to the stories of the 2 indian women(nandita das and shabana azmi). the word `fire' all of a sudden has many meanings - marriage, tradition, religion, motherhood, and probably a few others i did not catch. brilliant because of its social overtones. many who were offended by the premise for this movie should in fact be first to see fire(e.g. my mom, who actually loved it). why? because although fire is an attack on tradition, it is also an attack on tradition. in other words, that is its strength, not its weakness. traditional conservative social mores(whether indian or canadian or american or whatever) are useless if they enslave you. gender roles and self-denial can both do this. these are the things i took with me after seeing fire. hats off to deepa mehta\",\n"," 'i have

have yet to see a movie of his that does not fully lives up to my expectations. from re-animator over dolls to castle freak... they all belong to my favorite horror movies. and i do believe gordon belongs to the most talented directors in the genre because he can handle all sort of horror topics. his debut - the brilliant re-animator - was a comedy splatter movie while the pit and the pendulum does not contain that much violence or gore. this movie contains an intelligent and even educational story and it has great settings and costumes of the 14th century. the pit and the pendulum is an adaptation of the famous short story by edgar allen poe. the master of low budget - roger corman - already used this story once to make a great horror classic starring vincent price. stuart gordon\\'s movie is not really a remake of that one. they just used the same plot. pit and the pendulum takes place during the spanish inquisition. lance henriksen plays one of the best roles of his entire career as torquemada. he decides whether \"witches\" are guilty or not and when they\\'ll be burned for the eyes of god. a young girl, maria ( played by ronna de ricci who never did anything else in her career )who resists against his way of working is being arrested. torquemada wants to accuse her of witchery but he\\'s fascinated by her looks and her body. meanwhile, maria\\'s husband entered the castle and he wants to free his wife. the atmosphere and the settings impress the most in this movie. the ancient castle and the torture chambers are really intriguing. the costumes are terrific

it\\'s always shot with a lot of style and class. even though lance henriksen is getting all the attention in this movie, there are a a few other great performances in this movie. i\\'d like to bring

lindfors) to give an opportunity in the court to rehabilitate don juan from the gossips and rumors about his love affairs, and he is hired as instructor of the art of fencing in the spanish academy. he secretly falls in love for queen margareth but becomes loyal to her and her irresponsible and weak husband, king phillip ii (romney brent). don juan discovers the plan of the machiavellian duke de lorca (robert douglas) that intends to declare war to england and rules spain. with the support of his friends, don juan defends the queen, the king and count de polan against duke de lorca and his men. \"the adventures of don juan\" is a charming, witty and delightful adventure full of romance and comedy. unfortunately the cinema industry forgot how to make awesome movies like this one without the need of sex scenes or gore and sadism. the athletic errol flynn is amazing, fighting with foil and seducing the women in the story and the audiences in the real world, using intelligent and witty lines. the gorgeous viveca lindfors performs a queen with stylish elegance and class. the traitor robert douglas is the perfect villain, with treachery, ambition and machiavellism. in the end, this movie is highly recommended for the whole family as a great entertainment. my vote is nine. title (brazil): \"as aventuras de don juan\" (\"the adventures of don juan\")',\n"," \"its a real shame that

a lonely rural woman who lives on a farm and faithfully attends church. a masked killer is terrorizing the small town and there are plenty of suspects: town bad boy frankie, ingrid\\'s mysterious uncle carl, and the new stranger guy in town. the sheriff, played by aldo ray, is perplexed. he finds out his daughter was knocked up by frankie, plus he must deal with having two barney fifes as deputies. ingrid is also having many visions/hallucinations involving her mother, who killed herself after a tryst with a strange man. ingrid, just five years old, walked in on them and mom fled into the bathroom. it is no mystery that the man in bed with mom was mom\\'s brother, uncle carl. ingrid is attacked by the masked killer but escapes. later, the killer murders the local town lush and dumps her body in ingrid\\'s chicken coop. ingrid is later raped by frankie, and uncle carl almost walks in on them. frankie threatens ingrid if she talks, and the murders in town continue. ingrid is a fixture at church, and is almost raped again after an attack in the cemetery. eventually, the masked killer turns out to be the mysterious stranger. frankie, however, shows up at ingrid\\'s house, bounds uncle carl, but is stabbed to death by ingrid. carl buries frankie, makes an incestuous pass at ingrid, then disappears after ingrid goes to the sheriff. the sheriff guards ingrid\\'s house until the morning, when the deputies can come and dig up frankie. instead, frankie pulls up very much alive, and the deputies find a grave with ingrid\\'s goat. ingrid is upstairs in the bathroom, dead from suicide. the sheriff also gets a surprise when uncle carl flies in from new york. he has not seen ingrid in years, despite ingrid\\'s claims to the contrary. uncle carl visits ingrid\\'s house, and remembers how he slept with his sister before he drowned her in the bathtub, she did not commit suicide. the final scene, the scariest in the film, has mitchell in the bathroom, running hot and steaming water, and turning around to see a misty figure standing in the bathtub- ingrid. this thumbnail sketch might make this sound very suspenseful, almost hitchcockian, but it is far from it. may britt, as ingrid, tries, but she is failed by the script. her scandinavian accent is explained away as she spent time in \"a european orphanage up the coast.\" huh? cameron mitchell, who has never been good in anything, is not good here. the film makers give him the world\\'s worst fake gray hair at the film\\'s conclusion: the chalk white goop looks like it was applied with a trowel. the rest of the cast plays their routine small town characters without adding anything new. the biggest mistake here is the convoluted script. there are at least six different places toward the end of the movie where the final credits should have started rolling. clocking in at 97 minutes, this is fifteen minutes too long. poor britt spends most of her screen time either taking off her clothes (careful not to show any nudity) or hysterically running away from men, real or imagined. all the men here come off as horny and stupid. ingrid is the repressed frigid queen who fantasizes about being attacked and raped. she is religious, and hollywood has been telling us for years how strange and sexually repressed churchgoers are. the script never takes any chances, beating the viewer over the head with heavy handed images from ingrid\\'s psychotic mind. while there is some suspense here and there, for a horror film, there is not much. the possibilities here were endless, and the film makers did not take advantage of them. this should have been very suspenseful, considering the game cast, but everyone loses to a silly script and terribly low budget. \"haunts\" does not haunt. this is rated (r) for physical violence, some gun violence, sexual violence, some profanity, some sexual content, and adult situations.',\n"," 'this movie is funny in more ways than one. it\\'s got action. it\\'s got

san francisco to new york. maybe it was the perspective of a few years away, but this movie seemed to capture the essence of the city and its people better than anything else i\\'d ever seen (still does). it concentrates on one particular community - the chinese - but that\\'s fine, because so much of the city\\'s soul is refracted through the settings, the faces, and the maybe above all the voices of the characters. this is not the tourists\\' san francisco. the settings are humble and everyday: a taxi cab, the kitchen of a chinese restaurant, richmond district row houses, little chinatown apartments and small-business offices, the piers, a philippine elder center. this is what the city looks and feels like day to day to the people who live there - even now, in the era of silicon gulch urban redevelopment. unlike, say, dirty harry (in its own way an excellent san francisco movie as well), everything is filmed at street level: we come to understand the characters\\' points of view from the perspective their surroundings give them, not from some fancy vertiginous shooting. wang apparently filmed in b&w because he did not have the money to do otherwise, yet one of the strongest visual elements of the movie is the natural light he achieves. the often harsh, pervasive quality of the sunlight is one of my closest associations with san francisco: it seems to expose everything, bringing the buildings, the hills, the other landmarks down in scale and, in a funny way, making the people you pass on the streets seem more individual and potentially closer to you than they might in another place. wang\\'s photography perfectly conveys this, and even helps the story along at points. wang captures the speech and conversational style of chinese and other san franciscans better than anyone ever has, i think. if there\\'s such thing as a true san francisco \"accent,\" it\\'s what you hear from the balding taxi medallion broker (i think) who appears talking on the phone in one scene (listen to the way he calls the person on the other end \"ya dingaling!\"). the story is poignant and, despite a few very small missteps, makes its points beautifully about the longings that pull at the hearts of people living in old immigrant communities - including the justified political and ethnic resentments, and little ironic amusements, that help to fuel them. all this is communicated delicately - perhaps why some respondents here think the film meanders. it does not - suffice it to say that the two cab drivers\\' quest for chan becomes a quest for something more personal. chan is missing finishes up with a chinatown travelogue sequence backed by a goofy novelty song from the 1930s (i guess) about san francisco and all its crazy diversity. an american caricature, yes, but somehow not entirely off the mark either.',\n"," \"the truth is that about 80% of the people who see (have seen) this movie will not like it. why? because it is not that original.

brought back nostalgic memories from when i was a kid. some people say this movie has bad acting. i do not agree at all. while the story might not be the best ever, there is definitely nothing wrong with the acting. and the supersonic maiden one plane looks absolutely stunning, even though it is 70's b-tv-movie material. i really recommend it to fans of disaster movies. it is hard to get a hold

good luck, maybe smuggle in an ipod or magazine. can not believe this film got made!',\n"," 'more people telling me their favourite film, have named excalibur, than have chosen any other film. people tend to feel strongly about this film. i can remember that when it came out, a film magazine reviewed it twice, feeling that it had to do so, since its two reviewers had such contrasting opinions. in short, people who do not adore it, tend to hate it. those who hate it have failed to understand something very important: that it is set in the land of dreams. excalibur makes no attempt to be realistic. it is the film of a legend, and it tries to create a world of legend, and it succeeds. once one has realised that this is not the real world, then the film is internally consistent and works splendidly. merlin, towards the end of the film, even says the line \"your love brought me back to where you are: in the land of dreams.\" if anything, this makes the film even more tragic, because all of arthur\\'s sufferings have been not for his world, but for ours. the arthurian legend is probably the world\\'s best legend. it has been told a thousand different ways, but is so strong, that no retelling can harm it. the story is familiar, but this telling of it is not. the screen starts blank, with the distant drums of seigfried\\'s funeral march playing, and after a few captions, the curtain lifts to reveal a stunning opening sequence with horses breathing fire-lit breath into the night air, as uther\\'s men do battle with those of the duke of cornwall. the armour is dark, and greenish, and the movements slow, making this seem like a scene of battling dinosaurs. it is brutal and bloody. these are the dark ages. this is the time of chaos from which arthur\\'s kingdom must come. into the scene, in a cloud of swirling fog, comes a figure who will be present throughout the film, ageless and mysterious, nicol williamson\\'s merlin, whose voice carries over the din. i remember how suddenly i found myself immersed in this world when i first saw the film, and even now the hairs stand up on the back of my neck thinking about it. allow yourself to become involved with the film, and you will be rewarded. the costumes are magnificent. special mention must go to the shining armour, and morgana\\'s (helen mirren) ever-increasingly impressive series of outfits. the music is stirring (it uses \"o fortuna\" from carima burana before this had become a cliche). the acting is theatrical and good. each of these characters is on a stage, to be examined. this is not a film of quiet intimate moments. it is a legend, and legends are public. excalibur distills the arthurian legends into one film of watchable length very cleverly. at several points during it, a clever cut tells the viewer that several years have passed. single characters represent many things. at one point sir percival represents all the questknights, at another morgana is all that is evil. in telling the story quickly, the film uses simple direct speeches. in one scene, arthur visits guinevere, the woman he loved deeply, whom he has not seen for many years. he spends just a minute in her company and leaves, and yet the speech he delivers to her is so complete and so moving, that you do not feel robbed. he says his piece and leaves, needing to say no more. it is true that the film has dated a little. some of the hair-styles and special effects are not quite what they would be today, and the quality of the dubbing is not first-rate, but this is still stunning. everything seems to have come together to help this film look and sound good. the skies over the castles are spectacular, the irish landscape (it was shot there) looks the part. the visual imagination and daring to have camelot as a castle literally made from silver, and to have arthur\\'s final battle fought in fog with a huge blood red sunset behind it, makes this a feast for the eye. i am writing about one of my all-time favourite films. i cry every time i see the land burst into blossom as a reborn arthur gallops through it, and i feel the heavy warmth of tragedy as he is carried off towards the sunset to the isle of avalon. i am spoiling nothing by telling you that arthur dies in the end. everyone knows that he dies in the end. the whole film is leading to that moment. when you reach the end of the film, ask yourself this: where did he go wrong? what was it he did to lose his wife, his son, his sister, his best friend, all his questknights, merlin, his kingdom, his life - everything he held dear? \"the one god of the many comes to drive out the many gods. the spirits of wood and stone grow silent. it is a time for men and their ways.\" that\\'s it.',\n"," '\"a damsel in distress\" is definitely not one of fred astaire\\'s better musicals. but even astaire\\'s bad films always had some good moments. in \"damsel,\" astaire is jerry halliday, an american musical star who is in london on a personal appearance tour. he meets lady alice marshmorton (19-year-old joan fontaine), a beautiful english heiress, who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers. jerry believes that alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt. he tries to rescue her from her family\\'s country manor house, but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor lady alice will marry. keggs (reginald gardiner) the conniving butler, and albert (harry watson), the bratty house boy, each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging lady alice\\'s romance with jerry to make sure they win the bet. this musical has numerous problems. first, there is the plot, based on a novel by p.g. wodehouse (who co-wrote the screenplay). the story is slow, painful, and nerve-grating. when fred is not dancing, we have to endure endless annoying scenes of (a) fred romancing joan fontaine or (b) keggs and albert conniving against them and each other. the butler and the house boy are especially irritating. they are one-dimensional stock villain characters, the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth. you wish they would get off the screen and let fred dance. astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, ginger rogers. joan fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film, and is miscast in a musical. she has little going for her, character-wise, other than her lovely face and beautiful smile. george burns and gracie allen are along for the ride, as jerry\\'s publicist and his ditzy secretary. the duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot, and gracie has some funny lines, but she is also very annoying at times. the direction of the movie by george stevens is not well done. at times, the cinematography is horrible and off-focus. there are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets, to try to convince the audience that we are in london, not hollywood. (they must have used tons of dry ice in this movie.) on the plus side, the songs by george and ira gershwin are terrific, and have become classic song standards. and of course, the dancing in the movie is exceptional, thanks to astaire and his choreographer, hermes pan. but the musical and dance numbers are ill-used and ill-staged. at times, the cast seems to start singing and dancing because, well, it\\'s time for them to start singing and dancing. the musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot. (at one point, the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason.) the numbers include: \"i am dancing and i can not be bothered now\" -- fred dances well on a foggy traffic-filled london street. he does some great \"cane-twirling\" with a rolled umbrella -- but the number ends too soon when fred jumps on a passing double-decker bus. (in the broadway musical, \"crazy for you,\" harry groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls.) \"put me to the test\" -- fred, george, and gracie do a trio tap dance in an english cottage. george and gracie match fred step for step, but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason. \"stiff upper lip\" (the fun house number) -- at an amusement park fun house, fred, george, and gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor, rotating barrel, and with the fun house mirrors. it\\'s the best number of the movie, but it gets a little repetitious at times. \"things are looking up\" -- fred and joan fontaine do their one dance number together in the film, prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate. fortunately, it\\'s a very simple dance number because joan is not a great dancer. \"a foggy day in london town\" -- fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night, crooning about the foggy day when he first met joan in london. at times, he looks as if he\\'s not sure which way he\\'s going in the fog -- much like the musical number itself. \"nice work if you can get it\" -- a great song that is misused in the movie. during a social event at the manor house, fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour-faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song. each time fred joins in, the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave. (again, harry groener did a better dance number with this song in \"crazy for you.\") \"drum dance number\" -- as fred and joan are eloping, fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums. as usual, it\\'s a great dance number. but there\\'s absolutely no need for it, except to prolong the movie. the most contrived moment in the film comes when fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for joan fontaine. as he leaps from the balcony, he finds a conveniently-placed trapeze -- that\\'s right, a *trapeze* -- hanging from a nearby tree. fred (or rather, a stuntman in fred\\'s clothes) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it. the movie is worth owning on dvd for the dance numbers alone, but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the fast forward button on your remote. the >>ff button allows you to skip through the other, boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers.',\n"," \"in the book of life, martin donovan plays jesus, who shows up at jfk airport on december 31 to usher in the new millennium by battling with thomas jay ryan (satan) and deciding the fate of the world. there is also david simonds (kurt the accountant from amateur) as a compulsive, homeless gambler. as usual, hartley creates a surreal world in which the beauty of the ordinary made strange and otherworldly flows through artfully-framed scenes and urban/industrial landscapes filled with dazzling light and shadow. as usual, he introduces seemingly incidental details early, then brings them back later in hilarious and unexpected contexts--the humor is simple, but giddy and irrepressible. hartley has an amazing ability to build toward small and rapturous moments of the simultaneously mundane and outrageous. as usual, he creates a tone that is jaded and world-weary but at the same time, vulnerable, open, and honest. he moves within minutes from uproarious humor into language that is metaphysical and poetic-the kind of writing that is so dead-on and perfect that it's difficult to hold back tears despite the lack of obvious emotion. another awesome and highly entertaining film. the book of life is shot (a digital camera?) with a blurry effect: a sense of the celestial hand-in-hand with impending doom and a hyper-awareness of the present as fragile and fleeting in it's last moments. all of hartley's films have a way of prioritizing the present, but this unique effect compounds it as the images wash across the screen in a way that is at first jarring, but becomes increasingly beautiful as you settle into it. the final shot is spectacular. all this may sound precious, but the film is a comedy and it makes fun of itself even as it makes fun of the concept of armageddon, judgment day, and `urbanity.' although it is actually quite profound, moving, and life-affirming, it is for the most part lighthearted and playful. the acting is flawless in terms of the kind of the subdued tone that hartley has developed in his films (a tone that some people do not get and that prompts them to judge such acting as hollow--the same people who have a negative response to peter greenaway). as always, there are bound to be people who respond to this film with cynicism and scorn-people put off by hartley's abrupt shifts and what they see to be pretentious or mannerist techniques, but who has time to consider the opinions of such dull and callous fools? anyone who is a hartley fan will love this film-if they can get a chance to see it, that is. it's hard to say what it would be like on video.\",\n"," 'not much of a thriller, juncture is a beautiful drama that also raises questions of moral importance. lead kristine blackport (as anna carter) sometimes gives you

glioblastoma (a type of brain cancer). tumors in the frontal lobe can cause changes in personality, thus the question whether her decision to kill child-molesters and other criminals is a matter of

it very much.',\n"," 'words can not begin to describe the admiration that i have for this movie. even to this day, six years after seeing it for the first time, i can not get over the freshness, originality, and overall boldness of alex proyas\\' visionary masterpiece. now that proyas is getting a larger budget for i, robot this year, i felt that it would be time to credit proyas\\' earlier science fiction masterpiece in anticipation that i, robot would only live up to this film. from the opening shots of this film, the viewer is instantly plummeted into a bold and grand setting of an indistinct city that seems that this is how noir films of the forties would look if they were in color. after a display of the bizarre occurrence that happens to the city around midnight, we are introduced to the film\\'s protagonist, a man named john murdoch, who awakens in a bathtub, with no memory of his life or how he got where he was. needless to say, what happened to the dead woman next to his bed. after a few clues that seem to trigger brief glimpses of his childhood, he is chased from his room by three odd looking figures, looking for him. as murdoch wanders the city, trying to find his identity, we learn that not only are the strange people (who are appropriately named the strangers) looking for mr. murdoch, but a police officer named bumstead is as well, searching for the killer of not just the woman in the apartment, but six other women who were murdered in the same manner as the woman from murdoch\\'s room. also is murdoch\\'s estranged wife, who is trying to make a reconciliation with him after a falling out. even a therapist that murdoch has been seeing because of his wife\\'s infidelity is searching for him as well. everyone seems to have their own reason to be searching for murdoch, and murdoch is trying to figure out why, since he has no clue as to who he is. in a sense, murdoch\\'s quest becomes a search for identity in a world that is trying to label him. is he a murderer, is he a jilted lover, is he psychologically damaged person, or is he a like the strangers who are pursuing him? but that becomes the center question of dark city itself, do we make up who we are or are we made up of experiences and memories? we realize this question when we realize the purpose of the strangers\\' inhabitance of the city. they are actually aliens, whose race is dying out and they need to observe the human race to see what has made us thrive so much. so, we enter their experiment, which revolves around making the inhabitants of the city fall asleep at midnight while the strangers give them new lives by implanting new memories in them and changing the environment around them. murdoch also discovers that the reason the strangers are coming after him is because he has developed an immunity to the experiment, not falling asleep when everyone else does. he has also begun to take on the traits of the strangers as well, gaining their power to \"tune\", which is the ability to alter their environment by will alone. this whole concept suggests two things, the first being that humanity has the ability to adapt and thrive in a new environment and the other is that as an individual, humans have the ability to shape their world to their own desire once they are fully aware of themselves and their desires. the movie in itself is a brilliant commentary on our society as a whole which is displayed in the beginning with dr. schreber\\'s rat experiment in the lab, which comes to symbolize a smaller scale version of the strangers\\' experiment for us, putting rats (humans) in a maze of a city (life) and seeing if they can find their way. which also seems to suggest that as a society, we are merely just rats in a maze, wandering around until we come to the end. the strangers\\' insistence on doing everything as a group also brings up another interesting point about the human race is that our ability to be individuals is what makes humans thrive rather than conformity and similarity. \"dark city\" takes such bold and brilliant concepts, suggesting so much about our society as a whole and even the importance of individuality over conformity. the themes, once read into, take on such a strong and complex turn, unheard of in most science fiction films of recent years. then there is the matter of the setting itself, for no science fiction film can be complete without a strong and symbolic setting. the setting is vast and detailed, and this is not just the city, which is a sight to behold in itself. the underground world of the strangers themselves is claustrophobic, atmospheric, and actually is the most alien in architecture, suggesting a twisted, surrealistic world, yet one that is dependent on the world above them. the city above ground displays a rich noir feel in which one feels that there is something sinister lurking underneath it\\'s surface. even the blending of the time periods, seeing 30s architecture around 60s cars driven by people in 50s suits is even a hint off that the city has been fabricated out of different eras and pasts as one of the strangers even seems to suggest. \"dark city\" is a film rich in ideas, concepts, visual splendor, and atmosphere. it\\'s the kind of film that one seems to enjoy being lost in, despite the danger that lurks in it\\'s atmosphere. it\\'s a film that reassures it\\'s viewers that a strong understanding of oneself and staying true to yourself that one can conquer any world they are placed in. and as i, robot approaches, one can only hope that lightning can strike twice with proyas and his unique blend of visual grandeur and his depth will emerge and be embraced by a larger audience, who might seek out this film.',\n"," 'just

not deal with the nature, horses, shootouts, etc., but instead deals with one rifle, the winchester \\'73, and how this one rifle effects others and how they effect it. a rifle is not a living, breathing, human being, right? you may be inclined to believe that it is not. but it seems to have a mind of its own, for two very similar reasons: it gets back to its rightful owner in the end, even though that throughout the rest of the picture, its unthoughtful \"owners\" do their best to make sure it does not, and it never seems to be content until it gets back to its original owner, so, coincidentally, the unthoughtful \"owners\" always seem to lose it somehow or get killed trying to protect and keep it, until it gets back to james stewart, then it is \"content\". but, not every one of the owners deserves to have it. stewart does, of course, since he won it. mcnally does not, since he had to be a dirty thief and steal it. drake definitely does not, because he would probably lose it in some poker game, and besides, drake is too cowardly to fight, so why should he have a one-of-a-kind rifle if he will not even use it? duryea does not, because he is just a chuckling maniac, and we all know that chuckling maniacs do not deserve guns. this film has a sort of noir edge that only westerns can have, such as the ox-bow incident. westerns have their own type of noir, much different than the 30\\'s and 40\\'s bogart films. it is, hands-down, the best one out of all five stewart-mann westerns, even though my personal favorite is \"bend of the river\". the other four became much different than this one. i do not think it a coincidence to see that the other four were color, and this is black and white. this is because of the noir edge. all five films had the revenge and the dark past on stewart\\'s part play into the film, to the point where this is not just stewart\\'s dark side, but also actually a sort of character, not one to be listed in the credits, but one that you can only recognize and know that it is there, always present. however, this one, not just on revenge and the dark past, but also in terms of supreme danger, and characters that were very different than stewart make it surpass the other four in all aspects. but stewart never crosses the line. he does, however, walk the line between light and dark. this is why black and white played such an integral part in the film. they could have all been black and white, or they could have all been color. but this one is in black and white, and the other four are in color, and there is a very good reason for that.',\n"," 'enhanced by the expressive cinematography of agnes godard (beau travail), golden door is a visually striking tone poem that follows the journey of a peasant family from their primitive home in sicily to ellis island in new york at the turn of the century. it is a surreal, enigmatic, often strange, but ultimately deeply rewarding experience. interweaving dreamlike and symbolic imagery with gritty realism, the latest film by emanuele crialese (respiro) is like an impressionistic painting - a cinematic artist\\'s rendering of what the immigration process may have been like for our parents and grandparents. crialese\\'s \"magical, mystery tour\" came about as a result of his visit to the museum on ellis island, the looks on the faces of the immigrants depicted in photographs he saw, and his research into the harsh policies and procedures used during the admission of immigrants. guided by letters he read of immigrants sent to relatives who remained at home, crialese identifies with those impoverished immigrants who were able to see the positive side of things beyond their ordeal. to salvatore mancuso (vincenzo amato) and his older son angelo (francesco casisa), america is a distant dream that they know nothing about. after climbing a rocky mountain to pray to the saints for a sign, they are rewarded when they are shown post cards by salvatore\\'s younger son, pietro (filippo pucillo), a deaf mute, that depict the new world as a land where they can bathe in rivers of milk, sit under a money tree, or harvest giant onions and carrots. after disposing of their animals in exchange for shoes and suits, salvatore, his two sons, and his elderly mother fortunata (aurora quattrocchi) set out on their adventure with more hope than trepidation but the equation soon shifts the other way. as they board the boat and settle into their crowded third-class steerage compartments, the most-talked about scene in the film takes place. using an overhead camera that shows masses of people standing, as the ship pulls away, the frame is divided into those aboard the ship and those waving goodbye from the dock and the way they are separated implies they are being torn asunder from everything familiar. aboard the ship is a mysterious english woman named lucy (charlotte gainsbourg). crialese does not reveal her past or the reason she is traveling to america but she seems to stand for the onset of the modern world they are entering. though they eye each other cautiously, lucy becomes interested in salvatore and asks him to marry her in order to allow her to enter the country. the voyage is treacherous with a violent storm buffeting the ship. shot in almost complete darkness, passengers in steerage are tossed against the side of the boat and, afterward, bodies lie tangled and twisted on the floor as if in a macabre totentanz. the rite of passage through immigration processing at ellis island does not become any easier and crialese attacks the way illiterate peasants, in the name of preserving \"civilized\" society, are forced to put puzzles together, perform mathematical tasks, and undergo humiliating medical examinations to prove they are \"fit\". a marriage brokering ceremony feels like an auction block and the young women look despondent when they are matched with overweight middle-aged men. this is the only way they can enter the \"golden door\", however, since single women are rejected unless they have partners, ostensibly to prevent the threat of prostitution. through the fog the immigrant\\'s can barely see the land of milk and honey and there is no statue of liberty asking for the tired and the poor, the humbled masses yearning to breathe free. in their imagination, however, the river is still flowing, waiting for them to jump in. though the ending is ambiguous and one door opens on to a blank wall, another door symbolizes a rebirth of the soul and the passage we must all take from the old world to the new.',\n"," 'of all the made for tv disney movies that came out recently, this is one of the best. keira knightley is fine as the daughter of robin hood, and malcolm mcdowell is

their grouchy landlord--not a goat like in angora love. this whole goat angle is the worst part of the film. while you could understand the boys wanting to keep a cute little dog (after all, it is snowy outside), why exactly they bring a goat home is just contrived and pointless. according to the plot, the goat followed them home and so they got tired of shooing it away and kept it. huh?! this just does not make any sense--if it had been a giraffe or a cow, would they have done the same thing?! apart from being an unconvincing plot, the movie itself is pure laurel and hardy, with a familiar

convincing the audience of her devout hatred for men. why else would she ask her only friend to pose as a prostitute just so she can arrest cops who try to pick up on them? this hatred is also the only reason why she relentlessly pursues a perverted photographer who gives women a consensual thrill and the driving force behind this crappy movie. watching young go from frigid to full-frontal nudity does little to raise interest, but the temper tantrum she throws standing next to a fire by a lake does. watching her rant and rave about her self-loathing and sexual frustration makes love

should not be put together. obviously again noting since that this camera \"captures the death of a moment\" that would make sense because the children should have a life instead of slowly dying like the old man. write something back to me if you want to discuss. also i liked how it was a sort of criticism on cinema itself, but at the same time honoring it. plus the idea that the old man is dying,

and disease equals crime) and just enjoy the chase. it is not always easy watching a film like this now that we are well into this new century, as it is of a particular style that was very short-lived (post wwii through the early 1950s) and will unlikely be of interest to the casual film watcher. for those who will be watching this for the first time, sit tight for the big chase at the end. it is

compromise his principles. although the lovely miss agutter has received all the accolades it is mr cribbins and miss sheridan whose performances dominate \"the railway children\".they both know how edwardian society works from opposite ends of the spectrum but there is an unspoken mutual respect and understanding between them. but this is basically a movie about family.in an era when a mother can kidnap her own daughter and hold her to ransom and be considered as \"socially inept\" rather than unfit to live in decent society,and when two \"human beings\" can beat and kick a baby to death without being charged with murder,\"family\" may be seen as an old - fashioned,elitist, racist even homophobic concept,but a century ago it was the glue that held society together at all levels.mr cribbins\\' and miss sheridan\\'s families are archetypal for the age.strong and loving,sticking together against outside influences,integral units with a moral certainty mocked in the 21st century. what might seem to be a dull,preachy political tract is turned by mr lionel jeffries into a delightful hymn to hope,faith,optimism and courage. that all those attributes were once considered the norm and are now too often the subject of scorn and cynicism is a reflection on our society rather than miss nesbit\\'s. no one with more than a passing concern for the human condition can fail to be considerably moved by this quite perfect movie.',\n"," 'when this picture came out in 1944, i saw the previews. i was about 12 at the time. the previews showed the three girls being spanked -- which

fortunately, the guy sent me one i could view. found out that there was much more to the flick than the triple-spanking (which, doggone it, did not last long enough.) for instance, one of my all-time

everyone and seem to get away with it, and all with equal emotion? the liberated french girl who will screw the 17 year old virgin boy because of her sexual generosity, the too much flesh guy who goes

of british soldiers as bad guys battling against crypto zombies , that long time dead may have got lost in the market place but after finally seeing it i doubt if the merits of dog soldiers and 28 days later had anything to do with its failure - the reason it bombed is that it's a rather poor horror movie first of all can we please stop seeing movies where horny , drug taking teenagers get stalked and slashed. i had become very fed up by this plot by the early 1980s and it stopped being a good premise 20 years ago. okay scream and final destination used the same plot but the producers at least tried to do something a little bit different with the plot where as in this movie it's just well worn cliché as is the set up with a ouija board okay i am in a generous mood so i will not put the boot into director because it's a debut and i imagine marcus adams had a lot of enjoyment shooting the picture and it is fairly stylish. i should also point out that there is a not unimpressive sequence where two characters enter a house only for them to come to a sticky end. unfortunately mr adams also wrote the screenplay and it's this that is the film's undoing i am not much of a horror

joan blondell, paul stewart, zohra lampert, laura johnson and there is a cameo by peter falk. the premise of the film: an aging stage and film actress (gena rowlands)re-evaluates her life after an obscessed fan dies in a car accident trying to get her autograph. the movie has a slow pace and a dark, moody, frightening quality. it has a 60's cinematic look and it even reminded me of polanski's rosemary's baby without the supernatural horror. the fears here are the ones every successful actress has- she is getting old and she will become useless in her career. furthermore, she feels she has lived a life that lacks any true spirituality, humanity and merit. she has lived only for her career- she has no children, does not do charitable deeds, etc. the gradual disintegration of her personality is the meat of this film. she is falling apart. she's in a crisis. gena rowlands really gets into the character's tormented psyche and acts the part quite well. she is a terrific actress and this 70's film is a refreshing contrast to the often violent films of the period and or the disaster movies or adventure thrillers. it's a movie with lots of deep-seated emotion but has a cold, cynical feeling, as if cassavetes is criticizing the mainstream movies and actors of the 70's generation. either that or this movie is a product of the 70's which was itself cynical in many aspects- nixon's deception, watergate, vietnam, etc. although the production values are not great, and this film is not well-known, it's a very haunting film with haunting moods. kudos to the underrated and late director cassavetes who died in the late 80's.\",\n"," \"i was in college when jane visited vietnam; i thought her actions were disloyal to the united states, and to the men & women fighting in

ioffer.com. before anyone gets excited, the dvd set i received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their tv 15 years ago. the resolution and quality are poor. the images look like you would expect old re-recorded video to look. although the commercials were edited out, the ending credits of each episode still have voice-over announcements for the segway into the abc news program \"nightline\", complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990\\'s. even with the poor image quality, the shows were watch-able and the sound quality was fine. to this show\\'s credit, the casting was nearly perfect. everyone was believable and really looked the part. their acting was also above average. the role of jeff metcalf is played particularly well by kyle chandler (most recently seen in the 2005 remake of king kong). the period costumes were very authentic as were the sets, especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and décor. the direction was also creative and different for a tv show at that time. for example, conversations between characters were sometimes inter-cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes. the dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations. that takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case. as i started watching this series again i suddenly remembered why i lost interest in it 15 years ago. despite all the ingredients for a fine show, the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start. for one thing, the name of the show itself is totally misleading. when wwii ended in 1945, there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a \"homefront\" either. curiously, the first episode of the show \"homefront\" begins in 1945 after the war had ended. that\\'s like shooting the first episode of \"gilligan\\'s island\" showing the castaways being rescued. the whole premise of the show\\'s namesake is completely lost. i still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no, the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948. additionally, this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940\\'s. by the third episode, it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left-wing political agenda. the show is set in river run ohio, near toledo. however, the show\\'s ongoing racism theme makes it look more like jackson mississippi than ohio. part of the ensemble cast are dick williams, hattie winston and sterling macer jr. who portray the davis family. much of the series shows the davis family being discriminated against by the evil \"whites\" to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable. the racism card has been played and over played by hollywood now for over 40 years. we get it. we are also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis. the subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show, as it was for \"homefront\". the acting talents of williams, winston and macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical \"frightened / angry black family\". the wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in ohio was a kk member or something. the racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist-fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing, and leave it at that. devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid. in yet another ridiculous plot line, the big boss of a local factory (ken jenkins) is portrayed as an ebenezer scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees. the workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro-communist propaganda message to the viewer. personally, i think this series had great potential. the writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941 1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories. of course the loss of brothers, sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama. the situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or uso personnel passing through their town during training or en-route to europe or the pacific. the possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless. but no, the writers of homefront (david assael and james grissom) completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots. instead, they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left-wing politics. it would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage.',\n"," 'the hills have eyes is not a great film by any stretch of the imagination.for one the

fortune as a ventriloquist act their late poor mother never did. the trip will not be easy & sacrifices need to be made along the way, cars need to be stolen & anyone who gets in their way must be killed. angelina also wants to continue the family bloodline so kidnaps a teenage girl (katie chonacas) for norbert to rape & impregnate. with the cops hot on their tail will they find the success & happiness they crave? retitled to simply dummy (which was apparently the films original working title) here in the uk this was written & directed by mark jones the man responsible for starting the leprechaun (1993) franchise (gee, thanks a million mate...) & i have to say that i thought triloquist was rubbish & there's not a lot else to add although i will attempt to try & explain why i am of that opinion. the first thing to say about triloquist is that it's a horror comedy with heavy emphasis on the comedy, unfortunately it's not funny in the slightest which is obviously a big problem. there's plenty of swearing & some may find the very innocent looking angelina talk dirty amusing but i am sure they will be in the minority. there are a few visual gags like the dummy dummy having a dream in which topless strippers caress & kiss him but these come across as childish, immature & quite frankly desperate. the one-liners suck & i seriously doubt many viewers will find anything in triloquist funny, i certainly did not. then there's the rubbish story which makes you feel like you did not even watch a proper film, there is one of the worst twist endings i have ever seen that makes absolutely zero sense & in context with the rest of the film does not work as there are clear contradictions & plot holes. it's never explained quite what dummy is or who is controlling him & the twist only adds to the confusing & some might say frustration. to be fair to triloquist the film moves along like a rocket & there are few dull moments but with such a bad story, such unfunny jokes & gags which miss by the proverbial mile & an extremely unlikable central character it's still an incredibly difficult film to either like or enjoy. basically a bad taste road film as we see angelina, norbert & dummy murder their way across america stealing whatever car they fancy along the way there's not even that much gore in it. there are a few severed fingers, a neck wound & a bit of blood splatter which amounts to just about nothing. there's some nudity as well as a few topless girls are seen. there are no scares, there's no atmosphere & a really flat visual style that grows old very quickly. i also have to mention the soundtrack which i found extremely annoying & some of the songs used gave me a headache. although triloquist is reasonably well made it has no style & looks both dull & bland. the editing is also poor on occasion with some scenes not making any sense & character's suddenly popping up from quite literally nowhere. the acting is not great although paydin lapachin is a real looker but not enough of a looker to make triloquist worth watching. triloquist, or dummy if you live here in the uk, is crap by any name & i think it's as simple & straight forward

novel during its circulation. so what happened when the novel became a made-for-television movie? perhaps it is the below mediocre screenplay (oops!, teleplay!) by john pielmeier that consistently galumphs along in an awkward pedestrian fashion removing all sense of credibility to the story. perhaps it is the cut and paste direction by mick jackson that misses the pacing and character delineation. perhaps it suffers from the cinematography of an uncredited source or the 'liquid tears' musical score by daniel licht. for whatever of these (or all of these) reasons, this novel-to-film survives because it does make a good case for educating the public about the capabilities of those born with down syndrome. and for that it is worthy of attention. dr. david henry (dermot mulroney), a successful orthopedic doctor, is married to the beautiful norah (gretchen mol) and their lives are becoming changed by their pregnancy. on a stormy winter night in kentucky norah goes into labor and the henry's rush to a nearby clinic where david delivers his wife (the doctor is caught in a snowstorm) with the assistance of his old friend, nurse caroline gill (emily watson). after the delivery of a perfect boy child (paul) norah continues to be in labor and (surprisingly...) delivers an unexpected (!) twin girl. david and caroline immediately recognize that the little girl (phoebe) is a 'mongoloid' (this is before the use of the term down syndrome) and david, having a history of losing a little sister because of a birth defect) decides to send phoebe to an asylum for the mentally challenged: caroline is to make the delivery and norah is told the second twin died at birth. caroline follows instructions, sees the conditions of the 'home' where phoebe is to be deposited, shrinks in horror, and decides to keep the child. aided by a friendly trucker, caroline changes her solitary existence and mothers phoebe, finding a new life in her trucker's pittsburgh. norah insists on a formal funeral for phoebe - a fact that deeply disturbs david's psyche, and the henry's life goes on with only the one child paul, leaving submerged pains about the lack of phoebe's presence. norah gifts david with a camera ('peoples lives are like a camera, that's where they live - in a room captured by a moment') and david becomes obsessed with photography. norah grieves, drinks, and loses david's attention, while david traces phoebe's existence with caroline - sending money and letters to pittsburgh. paul (tyler stentiford to jamie spilchuk) grows up, discovers his mother's infidelities and is angered about his father's lack of communication and understanding, and decides to fulfill his goal of becoming a musician, and off to juilliard he goes. meanwhile phoebe (krystal hope nausbaum) has matured into a very highly adapted young girl, and the manner in which the broken marriage of the henrys happens and the healing atmosphere of phoebe's and paul's lives coupled with the courage that has supported caroline gill's struggle to gain acceptance in the world for those born with down syndrome forms the conclusion of the film. the cast of well-known actors tries hard, but only emily watson is able to resurrect a credible character from this squishy script. jamie spilchuk gives evidence of a young actor with much promise. dermot mulroney and gretchen find it difficult to mold empathetic characters form the corny lines they are given to deliver. the film is a mess, but the message about acceptance of down syndrome children and adults is an important one.

would go into this expecting much more, but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying when you consider that it's also rather dull and none of the characters are interesting. as the title suggests, the film focuses on a 'rogue'; in this case one that steals, womanises and smuggles stuff. that's basically all the plot that this movie has. the film does have a real 'seventies style' to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well. it sometimes seems like directors boro draskovic and gregory simpson were trying to put across some sort of point, although whatever that point is does not come across very well. seeing barbara bouchet on screen is always a pleasure, and that is the case here too; she's definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film. overall, the rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love the seventies style, but unfortunately it does not have much else

the reviews at the time of me writing this were particularly positive. a strange situation and hopefully my positive review will point people towards this old and mostly forgotten anime movie. space cobra is the funky tale of a smuggler and rogue who becomes involved with the three sisters of an ancient and dead planet and an evil force who wants to harness the planets powers. this is an old movie and the animation shows, but what it lacks in modern sophistication it makes up with an abundance of charm. space cobra is very much geared to a western audience and very easy to watch. there are few if any references to specific japanese culture and great for anime novices to watch and enjoy. space cobra himself is witty and likable. i cannot say how much of this is due to the english dub or the intentions of the maker, but this is one of the few japanese comedy characters that i find truly funny. the style is very sixties barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by yello. the style is colourful and imaginative and there is constant action to move the story along. the strangest aspect of this movie is how it begins as a comedy and ends on a very downbeat dramatic note. i cannot think of another anime or general movie that has been able to do this so seamlessly and convincingly. you barely realise that it is happening, but it is done so subtly and seems perfectly natural. you also really feel the characters went on a journey and they are lives were changed by the whole experience. check out if you can.',\n"," 'i saw this movie many years ago,and it was plenty

base. it deals with the attempted cover-up by the local marine commander of unacceptable conduct by a marine major which resulted in his being shot to death by his former girl friend, a marine captain. the man and woman had been lovers, but the captain attempted to break off the relation when she discovered her boy friend was married. he continued to stalk her, going so far as to fire his side arm in her direction at one time. finally he broke into her home, attacked her with a knife, and was shot twice with her service pistol and killed. the civilian prosecutor ruled the killing self defense, but the marines decided to charge the captain with murder. the major, you see, was a decorated hero from vietnam, and an old friend of the commanding colonel at the marine base. the captain, too, had made some enemies in her motor pool command, rejecting some male advances in a very butch style. there is considerable psychological freight motivating and controlling the actions of the principal participants in this drama, which the very capable cast gets across nicely. the director and editor, however, seem determined to obscure the happenings as much as possible with frustrating flashbacks and shifting points of view. you are lucky if you know where you are at most of the time. bear with them, though; it\\'s a worthwhile story as the captain\\'s court martial trial unfolds, and it seems every man\\'s hand is against her, even her attorney at times. the verdict? well, after all, this is rather a suspense story, so you\\'ll have to see for yourself. there is a kind of

it all, not too bad acting and a nice music score form into a decent mystery thriller. i liked how the heroine actually investigates quite a bit throughout the movie instead of just getting the conclusions laid out for her in front of her eyes. additionally the film does not use too many flashy, cheap shock moments and successfully tries to depend more on the mystery itself. and, contrary to the cliché, the heroine does not behave exceptionally stupid all the time. on the downside you will not have many surprises coming in the story if you have seen at least a few mystery thrillers. the ending actually managed to satisfy me, a feat rarely achieved by that genre of movies. if you like mystery thrillers and always thought that those loud, noisy \"in your face\" shock moments are

of the film itself. and if the film looks not to be very good, then lowering personal expectations in order to continue to enjoy the film is in order. however, there are also times when one should not make the mistake of confusing the lowering of personal standards in order to enjoy what might not be a very good film, with just plain, out-and-out stupidity. i went mad with joy when i found that english actor richard bremmer was going to be in a movie that was actually going to be shown on american television. he is almost exclusively a stage performer. and unfortunately, very little of british television broadcasts or productions can be accessed in the united states, so that usually killed that option for me to be able to see him. i tripped over my feet, running to park myself in front of my tv. it served me right. i knew full well that there could not possibly be any \"version\" of \"crime and punishment\" that could be portrayed in two hours. even if every word of dialogue were cut and the characters used sandwich boards--it still could not be done. i knew that, so i smirkingly \"lowered my expectations.\" what i should have done was to put my eyes out, stick my fingers in my ears, and have run shrieking out into the night, because that would have at least made sense. more so than this movie. i did not expect a good job of work, far from it. not in two hours. i did not expect good writing (i was at least not disappointed) and i did not even expect good acting. not with the constraints. what i did not expect, however, was such an intentional and hideous distortion of character of the story\\'s protagonist, rodya raskolnikov. rodya\\'s character was forcibly twisted into a grotesque parody of \"good guy\" in the opening of the story, seemingly so that it could either serve as a vehicle for the young and painfully handsome patrick dempsey, or in the assumption that the american audience was too illiterate and stupid not to be able to understand the concept of \"tragedy\". or possible both. this was an insult both to the story itself and to a fine cast. a lack of direction for dempsey was apparent, also. he could not seem to understand the concept of \"hysteria\", which was the essence of rodya\\'s personality, and instead resorted to ridiculous movements and twitchings. this was sheer laziness on the part of director joseph sargent. he did not take out the time to teach the role to an actor who has a tendency towards being physically hyperactive in much of his work. the film makers took a character who was not a noble character in any way and turned him into nothing more than a clown. establishing the character of rodya is the first and foremost thing in any production of \"crime and punishment\", no matter how restrained the time or budget might be. he must be established. the book itself is heavily reliant on speech, and there never has been a way to trim it for either a lengthy theatrical film or a television series, neither of which this production was. the point of the novel\\'s story was that rodya caused unbearable and needless agony and suffering to himself. and that he went into it willingly and with a perverse pleasure. that was a part of the \"crime\" and also a part of the \"punishment.\" he wallowed in his own self-induced emotional pains, and he enjoyed it. he fed on his own agonies. the novel\\'s rodya was an emotional masochist. he was not the classical figure of greek tragedy. it is this spot alone where the writer and director failed majestically. if rodja\\'s character is not established in the beginning of a film, then the entire story collapses and the film can from then on only be a sequence of loosely-stitched together scenes. even richard bremmer and ben kingsly, whose incredible performances and clear understanding and interpretations of their respective characters, could not save this film. it was destroyed within the first five minutes. bremmer and kingsly

stalin, kruschev had his role inflated and zhukov, stalin and chuikov ignored. there is no sense of the battle in the film either at the unit level or overall. the red army used firegroups of 25 men armed with bags of grenades and sub machine guns to fight the germans house to house in the rubble. there was little of the human wave tactics portrayed in the film. building were fought over room by room and floor by floor. no one went in the open as this was certain death to either side. the battle consisted of the red army holding on to a tiny corner of the city while the german forces were ground down. when the germans were weakened, soviet reserves north and south of the city broke through the weakened flanks off the nazi forces and surrounded the entire 6th army and part of the 4th panzer army. the 6th army was germany's greatest strike force, the same one that conquered france so quickly. at least 330,000 german soldiers from its elite force were killed or captured. only about 10,000 survived to return to german after the war. germany never recovered from this loss and it marked to start of their defeat. please read the book enemy at the gates and forget this terrible

baseball, and you have to at least sort of like tom selleck, but if you meet those criteria you should thoroughly enjoy this movie. selleck plays former major league star who finds himself traded (?)

his girl friend takanashi, and his interpreter. the chemistry between selleck and takanashi works very very well, this is really a very nice romantic movie apart from the baseball. look for haysbert

the purpose of a biopic such as this one. watch it, you will appreciate it too!\",\n"," \"what a strange film. it begins as a crime thriller and ends up becoming an indictment against war in africa; in my opinion it is far more successful at the former. an asylum seeker fleeing the fighting in the congo, gets a job at a security guard in a bank in eire. he seems a trustworthy sorta fella, however, his wife and child have gone missing in london. when the authorities track them down and grant them all leave to stay, it's seems it will be a happy ending after all. but when an irish gang kidnap the guy's family in order to get him to cooperate in a little heist they have planned, they do not count on his resilience. as well as a few skeletons he has in the closet that could have them think twice.. no-one's behaviour in this film makes any sense! character's personalities change at the drop of a hat, and seemingly intelligent people make some stupid decisions for no other reason then to add some spice to the plot. unfortunately this shoddy scriptwriting cripples our interest in the second half of the film, with one 'outrageous' revelation after another resulting in a forced tragic ending. shame, because the opening scenes are very promising, with eriq ebouaney portraying a very sympathetic hero, and fatou n'diaye also impressive as his deceptively strong partner. perhaps the film have been better if the movie had been about their reintegration into a new culture after surviving a traumatic ordeal in a war-torn environment. but no, we get the classic stereotypical gang of chirpy irish hoodlums, a botched bank raid and then the bloody aftermath, which is where things really come off the rails. there is not a single event that occurs in the last half an hour that convinces, not one happening that does not feel tacked on and absolutely zero elements that are not stolen from better movies. just because a film has a humanistic social agenda it does not give it the right to be this lacklustre. someone should have taken the first twenty pages of this script, developed the plot from there are thrown the rest of it on the fire. in my opinion, anyway. what could have been, we'll never know.. 4/10\",\n"," 'do not rent this movie. i ended up buying the \"previously viewed\" tape of this for $4.00. that was close to the price of a rental, so thought, i might as

little out there but very entertaining to watch.\",\n"," \"there's an old premise that the best storytelling is shown, not told. in terms of the latest spike lee joint, 'she hate me,' no truer words have ever been uttered. jack armstrong (anthony mackie) is a young vice-president of a pharmaceutical company on the verge of unveiling a vaccine for hiv, pending fda approval. through the nefarious actions of greedy senior executives, jack finds himself pegged as the scapegoat for this drug that ultimately will not be approved and the subsequent tumble in company stock. think enron, worldcom, et al. but spike will not let you think for yourself, as he keeps their specific names prominently displayed throughout the movie with overt and pointed references. margo (ellen barkin) who looked eerily like martha stewart only further illustrates this point. in a scenario reminiscent of 'enemy of the state,' jack loses access to all of his finances and is 'forced' to consider alternative means of generating income. after an unexpected visit by his former fiancée he accepts her offer to become father of her child her child and her lesbian lover's child. $10,000 for 2 successful impregnations is the deal and jack 'reluctantly' accepts. the next thing you know, he has lesbian women knocking at his door daily, five at a time, offering $10,000 each per impregnation. if you have ever seen a 'spike lee joint,' you are aware of the common threads woven into all of his movies. you come to expect certain elements and even certain actors. the fact that the supporting cast included such venerable thespians as ossie davis (judge buchanon), john turturro (don angelo), lonette mckee (lottie) and joie lee (gloria), while featuring a fabulous soundtrack by terence blanchard should be a surprise to no one. the fact that those actors, combined with monica belucci (simona), brian dennehy (chairman church) and woody harrelson (powell) did not amount to a great movie should be tremendously surprising and disappointing. from the opening credits, spike lee's signature is everywhere. from the rich combination of jazz and orchestral sensibilities in the underlying music bed that set the tone and timbre of the movie, you know spike lee is here. from the blatant opening reference and disdain of president george bush; you knew the direction this vehicle headed and who was at the wheel. according to lee, 'the story of 'she hate me' is very simple. it's about sex, greed, money and politics.' yes and no. it's about all of those things, but it's far from being simple. the message to be delivered was loud and clear. unfortunately, this message was one of at least 75 different and varied lessons 'she hate me' would offer to its viewers. even more unfortunately, spike chose oration for each and every 'message' in sermonizing character dialogue. either spike no longer respects his viewers enough to allow them to 'figure it out on their own' or that verbally bludgeoning them with his viewpoints (all 75 of them) is now considered a more viable storytelling alternative. the story of 'she hate me' is ostensibly about jack armstrong and his attempt at getting out of one sticky situation by entering another. in fact, it's not. this movie is more about the relationships and realities of women in love with one-another. this movie is at its best when spike demonstrates that regardless of gender or orientation; insecurity and jealousy are universal. the desires of family and fidelity are also universal, irrespective of familial unit structure. most importantly, the need to be accepted unconditionally is a definitive trait in all of us. those arguably were the most important messages in this movie and lee is right on the mark. where 'she hate me' specifically missteps is that the story is from the point of view of an unsympathetic character. when jack first started his new 'business' he supposedly needed money for the moment to counterbalance his frozen assets and continuing financial responsibilities. yet 18 women, 19 children and some $180,000 later, neither spike lee, co-writer michael genet nor character jack himself offers a reason as to why he continued such dangerous and fruitless indiscretions, for so long. the characters and relationships most enjoyable in this movie were fleeting in nature; components remarkably and conspicuously absent after introduction for most of the film. jack's relationship with his father geronimo (played by jim brown) was engaging. the sight of football hall-of-famer jim brown playing a character fighting diabetes and to save his marriage simultaneously was moving. the newly evolving relationship of geronimo with his son in the midst of the chaos around him was another meaningful subplot; one of many that lee did not revisit until nearly the end of the movie. a monologue by don angelo (john turturro) gave us another glimpse of turturro's acting brilliance. john turturro is a future academy award winner; it's just a shame this will not be the role that does it for him. if there is an explanation as to why some sub-stories and sub-plots were not covered as deeply as others it would be the fact that there are so many characters, all of which feel compelled to tell their life story. in fact, there are just too many people to keep up with, too many to care about in the end. it's like juggling fiery bowling pins, where too much concentration on one leads to really bad consequences. visually, 'she hate me' pays homage to films of the 1970's, with its simplistic camera angles devoid of lighting tricks or steady-cams. the knowing use of varying hues and blurred frames was quite appealing stylistically, even cool. this, combined with great musical cues featuring tenor saxophone melodies was a nice tip of the fedora to the film noir genre. 'she hate me' is raw and gritty in its imagery, remarkable in its musicality and at times sensual in its delivery but ultimately not a good movie.\",\n"," \"i have seen the movie holes and say that it has to be the best movie all year long. it brings out the child in everyone. i mean who would come up with the idea of having troublesome boys dig holes as their punishment? louis sachar thats who. although the movie was different from the book it was still very good. for example caveman/stanley was supposed to be the biggest one there. weight wise and height wise but zigzag/ricky was taller and armpit/theodore was bigger. also x-ray/rex was supposed to be one of the smallest boys but was not. the only thing that i did not like about the movie was that the flashbacks were rather persuasive and long. i would have rather seen more of the present than past but thats just my opinion. i especially like the work of the boys though. like squid/alan who was played by jake m.smith was supposed to be a moody and tough kid. jake m.smith performed just that and did a great job at it as did almost all of the actors in holes. so i would say if you havent seen holes yet then you should definatly see it when it comes out again or you'll be missing out on a whole lotta fun.\",\n"," \"i am too old to know (or care) exactly what the difference between rap and hip-hop is. and, being canadian, it's likely that i have never actually seen mtv, but i am not certain. but i thought this film was very funny when i saw it, a bright little satire. hip-hop culture is so pervasive these days that it's difficult not to keep hearing about it over and over.

we did not drop anything this big on iraq! perfect is the story of a rolling stone reporter (travolta) who trips over his ethics, or lack there of while writing two big stories. his first story deals with a computer tycoon in hot water with the u.s. government for selling his products to an eastern-bloc country. this angle is played way up considering the lack of details we are told about the situation. no matter, the story you will remember deals with a swanky health club in l.a.. travolta wishes to write a piece about how health clubs in the 1980s are replacing the singles bars of the 1970s as the #1 place for people to meet. take that premise and see how long you can stretch it. director bridges apparently thought he could drag it out for nearly two hours and still keep our attention. this film suffers from a severe lack of focus. there are too many location changes to count. there is also too much running around and too much time wasted on insignificant little things. for example, what was up with travolta's sudden trip to morocco near the end of the film. it had no purpose what so ever! another problem this film has is its tendency to drag out every scene to last as long as whatever cheesy 80s dance song is playing in the background. that gets old pretty darn quick. this film is also hopelessly dated in terms of fashion. if any guy came into my health club wearing tights or a fish-net tank top, he'd probably get beaten up. bridges & co also try to recycle a gag that worked in urban cowboy. in that film, there was a scene featuring numerous women dressed up for a dolly parton look-alike contest. in this film, we get about a hundred people dressed up as boy george in a scene at a hotel. in urban cowboy it worked since there was a legitimate reason for all the people to dress that way. they were at least trying to win a contest. the scene in perfect is useless and it only serves to date the film even further. this film was by no means travolta's worst. has anyone seen the experts or shout? this film did, however, have his most embarrassing scene. in it, he's sweating away in jamie lee curtis's aerobics class and doing a never-ending series of pelvic thrusts to the dance beat. his crotch has obviously been stuffed with a sock, or perhaps the thing hammer used in his pumps in a bump video. truly hilarious! travolta is a talented actor, but he has nothing to work with here. jamie lee curtis is also a great talent, but she is wasted as well. she looks absolutely gorgeous, but her character is so moody and abrasive that we can hardly stand her. the supporting cast of mostly unknowns fills out their respective stereotypical roles as well as they can. in all, this is a poor film on all levels. it tries to be an insightful look at journalistic ethics and falls flat on its face. it comes off as being little more than a two hour plug for rolling stone magazine. too bad. 3 of 10 stars so sayeth the hound.\",\n"," \"i was really disappointed by this film. having seen julian sands' name on the box, i thought 'ok, well, he's been in some pretty bad films (arachnophobia, boxing helena etc.), but he's also been good in things, so i'll give it a go'. plus it was screened at last year's frightfest, which is usually a guide to a film's quality. having a spanish director also sounded good, given that it was set in spain... but whilst the setting, costumes etc. were all amazing, and the script was pretty good, the actors really let it down, particularly mr sands, the lead actress and the professor - i could not take any of his scenes seriously!

it also was clear to me that many of those indians must have been real, and i did not detect any overt racism towards them. and john wayne looks so incredibly young! as someone who became a real wayne fan through the cavalry trilogy by john ford, and thought that stage coach was wayne's first as a leading star, this film was a revelation. the plot is very simple, again reminding me of a silent film, but the grit is very real indeed!

class that james bond did. 007 is still going strong with many actors who now have done the role and it shows no signs of slowing down. but the locker room type humor that typifies the matt helm

satellite that was captured. by of all people, a mexican beer baron who is considerably more than that. try and imagine august busch or jacob ruppert in the spy business as well and you have the part albert salmi plays. salmi did vile and disgusting things to pilot janice rule upon her capture because, well he's albert salmi. she's traumatized and only in the company of dean martin with whom she shared some tender moments back in the day will she go back and try to find the thing. oh by the way, they need rule because the satellite can not be flown by a man. something in the atmosphere when the switch is thrown kills all members of the male species. the bad guys do not find this out until too late. dino walked through this one as did the rest of the cast which looks bored, but also eager

irrelevant--just watch them both and enjoy. i compared this to ali baba bunny because both feature daffy at his absolute worst--greedy, nasty and very funny in the process. however, i think i prefer rabbit seasoning simply because bugs is also pretty awful in this one--doing horrible things right back to daffy every time daffy tries a dirty trick. the film begins with daffy leaving rabbit tracks right up to bugs' hole in the hope that a hunter (naturally, it's elmer) will blast the rabbit and leave daffy alone! not to be outdone, bugs time and again takes all of daffy's tricks and turns them around--and in most cases it involves daffy getting shot in the face! it's all very, very clever and funny and i do not care how old you are, this cartoon will make you laugh unless you are a grouch.

of sounding slightly sacrilegious, on first viewing i am kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with 'shaun of the dead'. now, given i view simon pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius, i realise this is a rather big claim. and to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'fido' will appeal to you. in a way the comedy picks up where 'shaun' left off, except we are back in the original 1950s living dead-era stereotypical middle-american small town. the zombie wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well-adjusted, useful members of the community. this, so we are informed at the outset, is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at zomcom - a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps? the beauty of the film lies in its dead-pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose. the charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect. themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through - the veneer of good clean living, keeping up appearances, repressed emotion, muddled parental values, social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual. it's a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the film's all-round strong cast. it's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part. it's also fun imagining what billy connelly learning his script must have been like...

problem is, i really wanted to like this because of the environmental/physical similarities, but the dialog was inane and i suspect the original target audience was actually older than the 7 - 10 year old demographic to which it belongs (due to some fairly graphic violence, e.g., blood spatter). also, the tone is so preachy i only kept watching so i might see if it could be saved by the insertion of a cute air-bunny or something to provide comic relief (no luck there, just whining pirates). if you can endure the saccharin and the stolen physical metaphors (e.g., worst use of a flying whale as a template for terror), have fun ripping it to shreds (ala mst3000).',\n"," \"let me first say, i did not select this film to watch, but it was scheduled on tcm at our movie watching time and my wife

deadwood. not so much a television series as an opera without music, deadwood is painted on a very broad canvas. is it swearengen's soliloquies to the severed head in a box? what about e. b. and his eloquent rants at fate or the bone deep brutality of tolliver? perhaps it's the earthy, pragmatic trixie or calamity jane, who manages to be both world-weary and innocent. maybe it's david milch's shakespearean language. whatever it is, deadwood ranks as one of the best and most unusual series in television history. if you are a fan of great character actors or just excellent acting in general, this is the series for you because deadwood is all about the people. that may sound obvious, but deadwood's brilliance comes entirely from its characters and what they have to say. you could set them on the moon and they would still fascinate. noting a few of my favorites, ian mcshane has always been fabulous but what fun to see him as the foul-mouthed al swearengen. he dominates the town by sheer force of personality. of course, al is also very intelligent and frequently finds himself surrounded by idiots - a couple of said idiots wonderfully played by william sanderson and w. earl brown. powers boothe, who excels at charismatic villains (anyone remember him as jim jones?) has fun with cy tolliver. a couple of (to me) unknowns who turn in great work are robin weigert as jane and paula

young fillies is wise old mare joan crawford who's been around the track a few times on screen and in real life. she looks right at home as the boss lady as well she should have at this point. around the time she was making the best of everything joan crawford became a widow when her fourth husband, alfred steele died. it was a particularly traumatic event for her, she woke up one morning and found him dead in bed next to her. she inherited all of his stock in pepsi cola where he was the board chairman and during the same period as the best of everything was being made, she wound up the queen bee at pepsi cola. life does sometimes imitate art. so that authority as she barks out dictation and coffee orders to hope lange rings real true. in fact all the women here with the exception of lange are in for some rough sledding. it's rough for lange too, but she literally makes the best of everything. what a collection of stinkers the men are in this film. the best of them, stephen boyd, is a heavy drinker. the others louis jourdan, robert evans, and brett halsey, are as slimy a collection of rodents as ever gathered for one film. i can not forget brian aherne either who's the fanny

this last night at a college movie house, i could not help but think... when is this gonna end? a very long and ponderous two hours and fifteen minutes. i had only seen a part of cremaster 3 on dvd and thought i knew what to expect. that said, experimental films such as this are better digested in small increments. there are a couple of beautiful/horrible images... including the title sequence (no kidding), but if you go into this expecting any kind of plot or meaning, then you are in for a long, snooze-inducing ride. i managed to stay awake for the whole thing (if that's a compliment) but more often than not, i was waiting for some kind of meaning or narrative... big mistake. among the collection of images are a very ornate gift-wrapping ceremony, the creation of a disgusting dish of what appears to be petroleum jelly slabs formed with a cookie cutter and sprinkled with shrimp (this is served to the crew of the ship which is shown throughout the film), a large blubber cheesecake with a large tentacle turd placed in the center of it, and the mutual evisceration of bjork and director matthew barney which eventually culminates in some bizarre kind of communion, followed by their transformation into whale-like creatures. the soundtrack is at times beautiful and annoying... sometimes even maddening. at one time, there is a song being sung by bjork to go along with the ephemeral rituals being played before us, and at other times there is just a constant droning of a high-pitched instrument, which we see a mysterious woman playing at the beginning and end of the movie. if this sounds like it does not make sense, that is because is does not! if this sounds like your cup of tea, then you will absolutely love it! if this sounds like something that you probably will not like, then stay far away from it, because you will most likely walk out of the theater during the halfway mark like several people at the screening i attended. this is the very definition of an art film. you get from it what you take from it. but otherwise, there really is not much there, other than a few oddities and constant construction and deconstruction rituals. i am glad that there is a place for films such as this, but i can not say i would want to sit through it again. however, i can not say i would not want to see one of barney cremaster films from start to finish and compare it with this. i think, perhaps now that i know what to expect i might enjoy something like this more. to give you an idea of what kind of comprehension factor this film has, i probably would have liked it better if i had gotten stoned. then again, it could have felt twice as long as it was, and then it would have really gotten ponderous. definitely not for everyone.\",\n"," 'i tried to watch this and

a different sort of \"peril\" movie. one that throws up another slant on psychosis and thus makes it difficult to hate our dangerous protagonist. ryan and lupino are a great combination, they had also done the excellent, and far better, on dangerous ground this same year. so with both actors clearly comfortable together, it brings out a finely tuned character story all based in the confines of one

victorians called hysteria. it consists of being a woman and being treated very badly by a socially and sexually superior man. david sutton (van heflin) is an unthinking cad who wanted casual sex with a vulnerable, lonely employee from a nearby holiday house. being his social inferior, louise (joan crawford) thought she could improve herself by going all the way with him (a big deal back then because birth control was so primitive). this rash move causes her to get desperate when she senses david\\'s coolness, and then deeply wounded and enraged when he callously ends their affair. although the movie attributes it all to \"love\", it is her sexual betrayal by david, and the casual arrogance of his superior social status, that unbalance her. moreover, things go wrong at her residence, where she works as a servant or nurse to a married woman who falsely accuses her of involvement with her husband, an accusation that is echoed by the returning daughter. this further injustice by her social superiors drives her unhinged. the story is told in flashback after she goes into a \"hysterical\" trance on the streets of downtown los angeles. there\\'s a lot of psychiatric lingo around her treatment and confession, but the illness is no \"hysteria\", it is frustrated outrage against social and gender injustice -- only hollywood can never tell it that way. above all, women could not be told the truth about their condition after world war two, when they had to be driven out of the factories where they had worked beside men and back into the home to be consumer housewives. this is really a victorian throw-back morality tale: it was exactly the kind of case with which the sigmund freuds made their name by locking up troubled wives and daughters in imperial austria. that said, it\\'s a well-told yarn with great studio sets and a strong central performance. note the cameo scene at the bar between geraldine brooks and van heflin. when he takes his eyes off her to ogle the cigarette girl, geraldine says: \"that\\'s so american, wanting more than you have got!\" yes, this film fails to get to grips with the underlying issues, but it\\'s enjoyable \"noir\"

appreciating anything about the movie. though beowulf is portrayed in the epic as the great leader and hero who never has done a dishonorable deed, he is, in the movie, portrayed as a liar and a deceiver. he defeats grendel by closing his arm in a door. he never kills grendel's mother because she seduces him and together, they beget the dragon. how does this even make any sense? he returns to the geats claiming to have defeated grendel's mother and is then made king by hrothgar. this is, of course, good for beowulf, because he has a thing for wealtheow, hrothgar's wife, anyway. the kind and noble king hrothgar has also been degraded to a cheating husband who also sleeps with grendel's mother (hence the existence of grendel) and who end up killing himself after making beowulf king. the only noble deed that beowulf seems to achieve (in the movie) is by severing his own arm from his body and by tearing out the dragon's heart with his bare hand (neither of which is in the book, by the way.) funny, in the book, i do not remember the fight with the dragon leaving the cave at all... we can only pray that someday someone does this epic justice and makes a decent film out of it.

gone. trance - first 3 seasons she should have been the mystery of the crew. it got fast boring and when you finally get the secret it is really not interesting. harper - character with more potential than always just being the puny scientist. my personal favorite nerd. beka - in the last horrible season her role finally flowers and she is permitted to be more than dillons puppet. she should have been written that way all the time. tyr - the only character that developed throughout the series. unfortunately that was destroyed in the end by incompetent writers. nietzscheans - an unbelievable race that never really seems plausible. unfortunately they have a very big role in the series. so if you want a series with interesting characters and stories then look for something else. this is very far from good sci-fi. it seemed like the writers ended up not knowing if they were writing a superhero or sci-fi series, and it turned out bad both ways. all in all i have a hard time understanding why many good sci-fi series die after one season or less and this lasted 5 seasons.',\n"," 'well \"wayne\\'s world\" is long gone and the years since then have been hard for snl off-shoot movies. from such cinematic offal as \"it\\'s pat\" to the recent 80 minute yawn, \"a night at the roxbury,\" many have, no doubt, lost faith that any other snl skit will ever make a successful transition to the silver screen. well fear not because tim meadows comes through in spades. the well-written plot maintains audience interest until the very end and while it remains true to the leon phelps character introduced in the five minute skit, the storyline allows the character to develop. the humor (consisting largely of sex jokes) is fresh and interesting and made me laugh harder than i have in any movie in recent memory. its a just great time if you do not feel like taking yourself too seriously. tiffany-amber thiessen of \"saved by the bell\" fame, makes an appearance in the film and looks incredible. finally billy dee williams, reliving his colt 45 days, gives the movie a touch of class. and for those out there who are mindless movie quoters like myself, you will

and almost as silent as a library. most of the acting is below average, and the \"point-of-view\" moments are so old news. acclaimed composer christopher young of such films as \"hellraiser\" and

looking automobiles. if you are a viewer interested in cars this production, by producer jerry bruckheimer (\"con air,\" \"the rock\"), is worth seeing just to feast your eyes on the glossy vehicles. although the film secretes a stench of weakness in many areas, its precise sense of action and excitement make it a moderately successful summer thrill ride. the film stars giovanni ribisi (\"the mod squad\") as a young crook named kip raines, who, as the movie opens, fails to deliver a long list of expensive cars to the powerful criminal raymond calitri (christopher eccleston). when kip\\'s life is threatened because of such, his older brother, randall \"memphis\" raines (nicolas cage), a retired but skillful car thief, is called upon to complete a task in exchange for his brother\\'s survival: steel fifty cars-specified by model, color, year, and make-in only four days. memphis disburses the first three days recruiting a team of bandits to help him pull off the heist. the crew includes sara \"sway\" wayland (angelina jolie), a sexy yet gruff retired car swindler knowing memphis through previous business, a fellow named mirror man (t.j. cross), the aging and wise otto halliwell (robert duvall), as well as tumbler (scott caan), atley jackson (will patton), toby (william lee scott), and donny astricky (chi mcbrde). contributing to the film\\'s drive and tension is a subplot involving two police detectives, roland castlebeck (delroy lindo) and drycoff (timothy olyphant), who suspect from previous experience that memphis and his crew are up to no good and keep an extra close eye on them. there is not much time for character development here; the audience gets to know these people though their rugged lifestyles and assume tough personalities through the films hard core, stylish atmosphere. to make matters even worse for the film, the dialogue fails to define the characters with a gritty cultural tone. i am not stating i think profanity and vulgarism is necessary for thrillers to flourish; i actually honor the director\\'s decision to sustain from extreme foul language in a movie that could have very effortlessly earned an r-rating. however, i do believe in a movie such as \"gone in 60 seconds,\" to strongly develop the character\\'s enlightenment, dialogue needs to be believable and authentic. in spite of problems, the characters are effective due to the top notch, perfectly cast performers responsible. nicolas cage\\'s melodramatic performance is intense and convincing. angelina jolie\\'s sleazy appearance is completely appropriate here. delroy lindo is deliciously sturdy and believable. giovanni ribisi, scott caan, robert duvall, will patton, and christopher eccleston provide persuasive supporting roles. the film contains standard structure, with a satisfactory first act that elaborates on the story\\'s style and the character\\'s motives, sets up a fast-paced theme of action, but lacks depth and strong character introduction. in the second act we run into a few more problems: the story wastes time during much of this segment, never really building up for the third act. while the middle of the movie occupies much time, and a sex scene provides a solid mid-plot, not a whole lot happens. the third act is pretty much a sheer adrenaline rush containing furious wall-to-wall excitement and one of the most intense car chase sequences ever filmed. the soundtrack to \"gone in 60 seconds\" contributes a great deal to the inspirational action scenes. it is scenes like the car chases that makes this movie work in spite of several destructive faults. dominic sena, whose career has mostly consisted of directing commercials, has an appealing style and a decisive attitude in \"gone in 60 seconds\" which will grant audiences with two hours of commotion, thrills, and excitement but not much more.',\n"," \"if anything, william girdler was an opportunist who wanted a piece of the action in regards to whatever was popular during the time. i mean, a blaxploitation flick in louisville, kentucky.. who would of thunk it?!?! i can just imagine the enthusiasm he must have had getting pam grier, quite a hot item, to star in his picture. if you are pretty familiar with the genre, girdler's sheba, baby does not necessarily stray too far from formula. despite a change of venue, the film still deals with a ruthless businessman nicknamed shark who muscles in on loan companies, using stooges to threaten them in order to get their signatures. grier is sheba shayne, a former louisville cop working in chicago who returns home at the request of her father's partner, brick(austin stoker, assault on precinct 13). sheba's father, despite shark's bullying tactics(.. his man in town is pilot, a wannabe gangster, equipped with stooges who are not that menacing, rather buffoonish in nature, so thin-skinned they hire hit men outside of town to shoot up the shayne loan building), will not give up his company, and this eventually costs him his life when a warning through the use of brute force, leads to his being killed. sheba will get her revenge on all those responsible for his father's death. in other words, shark's ass is grass.. can you dig it? seeing grier with a magnum is enough to sell this particular film, the novelty of the setting being in louisville is part of the package. you even get to see a speedboat chase, grier in shootouts with gangsters(.. not necessarily the most polished kind one might be accustomed to seeing in a chicago or new york during this period in blaxploitation), lots of blood spurting from bullet-riddled bodies torn apart by gun-fire, and colorful characters(.. such as a wimpy loan shark in pimp-dress named walker and pilot who is one of the least scary mobsters you are likely to see)who show up during the film, most having the misfortune of coming in contact with a very angry sheba. the plot itself is nothing special, but grier is always worth watching, and girdler orchestrates plenty of action sequences to keep his target audience entertained. a modest success for girdler, and one of his more accomplished films.\",\n"," 'i was surprised to come upon this film \"witness to murder\" tonight on tv as i had not heard of it before - always nice to discover an old movie with excellent, familiar actors. i get the impression of it being a part of the transitional period for some actors from movies to early tv dramas, in live productions that carry such realism as this film does. i tuned in late and missed the first few minutes of the movie where wily albert richter (george sanders) is purported to have committed his evil deed; unfortunately sanders has always been one of my favourite actors, one of the best ne\\'er-do-wells (as in the ghost and mrs. muir, samson and delilah, and all about eve), and i was not a little old lady in those days but a budding teenager. his suave demeanour always fascinated me and he carries this over from film to film. by the way, in this 1954 movie his few lines in german were not very convincing but his villainous role is very well set forth. it\\'s obvious that barbara stanwyck as the frustrated witness, cheryl, carries a huge emotional burden throughout, and does it well - a real pro! this is a moderately predictable melodrama when crime inspection was more simple somehow. the

is an average and conventional screwball comedy, where it\\'s rather hard to find the hitchcock\\'s touch. maybe you can catch a glimpse of his shadow (wich is not much) in the cruelty that carole lombard is sometime capable of (but it\\'s well hidden in an impersonal package), in a vertigo scene where two of the characters are trapped on top of a trade fair attraction, and maybe in the character of the mother. and that\\'s about it ! even for the hitchcock fan, there is little to connect with. and for the screwball comedies amateur, there is not very much more: none of the situation are exaggerated enough for being really funny, and we are far from the masterpieces of hawks for instance. and if one or two scene are quite amusing, there are not even the funniest in hitchcock\\'s filmography, who created comical situations in almost all his movies (even \"psycho\" could be considered full of very dark humor). so, there is really little to save in this movie, that can without

trivialized the longer the movie goes on. although bullock is strong in her role, it\\'s not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing. ben chaplin\\'s talents are wasted in a forgettable role (he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated \\'birthday girl\\') as well as chris penn, who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him. anyway, the plot really is not even a factor in this movie at all. the two teen killers played by ryan gosling and michael pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie. their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well. it\\'s too bad they were not in a much better all-around film. barbet schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker. bottom

superbly acted, emotional, funny, violent and at times very surreal this is a movie has it all.\",\n"," \"i came away from this movie with the feeling that it could have been so much better. instead of what should be a gripping, tense story of a boy's fight for survival in the wilderness, it comes off as a national geographic documentary meets columbia sportswear ad. the film begins with brian (jared rushton) preparing for a journey by plane to see his father. his mother fortuitously gives him the curious choice of a hatchet as a going-away gift (what's wrong with a rubik's cube?), little knowing how badly he will soon need it. once in the air, the plane's pilot (a blink-and-you'll-miss-him cameo by ned beatty) suffers a fatal heart attack, leaving brian helpless as the plane crashes into a lake. extremely lucky to walk (or rather swim) away virtually unscathed, brian must find shelter, food and hope for rescue. here is where the main problem with the movie begins. by the very nature of brian's solitude, jared has very few lines to speak, and so the film ought to have compensated by ratcheting up the tension of each scene. instead, he is shown walking around, sitting around, and so on, with only a minimal sense of danger. as a result, too much reliance is placed on flashbacks to the parents' troubled marriage as the source of tension. these scenes merely get in the way and do not particularly add much to the story. even worse, occasionally jared his face covered with mud - lets out a primal scream or two, which conjures up unfortunate parallels to `predator.' speaking of unfortunate, we could have done with being spared the sight of his mullet, but it presumably helped keep him warm at night. another disappointment is pamela sue martin in a totally ineffectual performance as the mother. both she and the father have very little impact in the movie. for instance, we are never shown how they react to news of brian's disappearance, how they might be organizing rescue attempts, and so on. this is just one source of tension the film-makers would have done well to explore instead of spending so much time on events that happened before brian embarked on his journey.\",\n"," 'people people people. whew. let\\'s not be hasty, selfish or unreasonable. sure this movie had it\\'s flaws. the locale\\'s may have seemed just a teensy bit artificial(the most common critique), but downing the movie because sam jackson \"stole\" the violin, and on top of that attributing it to his color is downright uncalled for! and further more, to say that \"the times we live in\" are the reason for us over looking the fact the violin was whisked away immorally is a clear fall back on cliche for a lack of intelligence. because that\\'s what this person is challenging. the morality of what jackson did in the closing moments of the movie. if we were to really analyze the morality from each owner to the next, we would find that morality was not really the wave of fortune the violin was riding on(it was stolen from a grave for crying out loud, not to mention almost burned for simply being... a violin). if not liking it because of it\\'s closing immorality is not missing the point and the essence and the true exsistence of this film, then i do not know what is. this movie, as shockingly revealed as it was, was not about the life of this inanimate object. surely the violin did not have a life. it was merely the carrier for the essence of the character of anna bussotti, nicolo\\'s wife. because he used her to complete the instrument, it was endowed with her essence. that is where you are to find your morality in the tale. that life, our life, our essence, our being, is lived not only in our bodies, in these pathetic heaps of flesh and bone, but in everything around us. the morality is that nicolo\\'s love for his wife, made her immortal in the violin, and her song, was a gift passed down to each of the ones touched by the violin\\'s life. therefore it is quite inconsequential, the morality of the people(and their actions) and events surrounding the violin, to say that it is the times we live in, or the race of the man stealing the violin, because the story encompasses a much higher enlightenment. easily seen, too, if you do not analyze the mistemperments and shortcomings of the people surrounding the voilin to a point where they consume your vision, blocking the \"true\" lesson or moral, or whatever you want to call it. the lesson, or better put: the essence of \"life\". tres bien by girard.

was not disappointed with this purchase. blood castle is one of those trashy european horror films that has almost no redeeming quality except for being thoroughly entertaining, for all the bad reasons. the opening alone was worth the price of the dvd: our heroine, dr. ivanna, arrives at the castle where she\\'s supposed to help a scientist, baron dalmar, who does experiments on dead tissue. on her way to the castle 1) a man tries to rape ivanna. 2) the castle\\'s housekeeper fights with her. 3) the maid wants her dead. 4) and finally, baron dalmar nearly spits on her and wants her out the next day. hmm... something tells me she\\'s not welcome. with such a miserable arrival, you\\'d think ivanna would leave the place in a ny minute but no, like so many great trashy films, our \"headstrong\" heroine decides to stay put and even enjoys a candlelight dinner with the grumpy baron on that same eventful day. the intro is so over-the-top trashy (it\\'s even greater than the memorable first few minutes of that canadian film, junior) that i knew i was going to enjoy this. but the fun does not end there. ivanna is repeatedly drugged whenever she goes to bed at night, only to wake up from unconsciousness, naked, bound and tortured in mild sessions of s&m by an unseen man. even after experiencing these nightly s&m sessions, ivanna stays at the castle, dully convinced by the angry baron that what she\\'s experiencing are nothing more than dreams. to be expected, even after being treated so badly from the get-go, ivanna, falls in love with the baron. ivanna completely disregards anything negative about him, including the obvious fact that the dour baron is popular with the young ladies. every women at the castle (it seems only women work there) is in love with the miserable chump, who does not mind taking advantage of the pretty young things. things get even sillier as someone lurks around the estate and kills (and has been killing) women. basically, the baron\\'s physically disfigured brother, igor is responsible for everything. in a very long winded scene, the brother warns the baron he should not get too involved with ivanna or he\\'ll suffer the consequences. so what do the baron and ivanna do about this? well, they get married of course! during the very brief marriage ceremony, the baron is shot by one of the angry locals (father of one of the dead girls). but all of this does not deter ivanna, who, amidst all the dead young ladies and torture surrounding them, cheerfully comforts the hurt baron that \"it\\'s just a flesh wound\" and the two can go on and enjoy their honeymoon at the castle, where the killer/rapist/torturer brother is. the whole thing quickly devolves into a nightmarish love triangle of sorts, between ivana, the baron and igor. blame it all on love! anyway, you get the idea: subtle it\\'s not. almost everything is over-the-top ridiculous in this film and when it\\'s not ott, such as the predictable climax, things get a tad boring. but for most of the film, the director or writer revel in one illogically trashy moment after another. i really love these kind of films, everything as subtle as being hit over the head with a sledgehammer, and populated by characters behaving illogically. even those who made the retromedia dvd realize this and when you go to the scene selection section, we hear one of the funniest bits of dialogue from the dubbed movie looped endlessly. the production values are beautifully risible. the opening and closing credits, with those candles and red curtains... ah, a soupçon of class. the music sounds sometimes like something from a tim burton film, which only adds to the oddness of it all. and customary to these kind of films, when the young ladies take off their clothes, they just beg to be killed. as a standard film, i rate this a 2, but as a \"it\\'s so bad it\\'s good\" film, i rate it a solid 8 stars. if you enjoy trashy films, please watch this one.

on his knees possibly in a confessional booth. ironically this issue is currently all over the news. it's almost as if the writer knew of a dirty little secret and was exposing it with this film. the character's army flashbacks are interesting too, especially since real life serial killer jeffrey dahmer had a bad experience in the army as well. it seems to me at second look that this film is a realistic look of how a lonley individual with serious past issues can slowly become completly insane and end up murdering people. to top it off there is some funny dialogue by the old ladies in this film to soften the serious tone. a second look at this film reveals a seriously under rated study of insanity. the original title slipping into darkness fits the movie better than the blood shed tag which will steer you the wrong way!\",\n"," 'warning may contain spoilers since this did not make theatres (thank god) every dvd and vhs with this movie on it deserves to be axed, chainsawed, stabbed, nailgunned and everything that patrick bateman did to his victims in the movie and book. whereas the original had originality, humour, sharp wit, and good script writing, great direction and acting talent, this movie lacks all of them. harron, turner, bale, sevigny, dafoe and others made a great movie. of which both the making and finished product was put through the ringer with locations withdrawn at the last minute, shooting having to keep a low profile, and banning attempts. the result was a work of art. but this film undoes all the work of the original. the acting is wooden, characters are played lamely, and lack any emotion, charisma or personality. wit is non-existent, and the attempts at humour are so lame that if i were to laugh i would laugh at the patheticness of it all. the music is awful and the voice over (unlike in the true american psycho) is annoying. and while there seems to be an attempt at sending up campus life and politics, it is not a redeeming factor at all and the writers appear to give up on it after not too long. it is simply a teen slasher movie that has (for reasons unknown) added the name american psycho to itself, and brought in the patrick bateman angle. it is like this scenario; artist a does a painting, artist b does their own painting, but then places scenes and subjects from the work of artist a. i am not sure how long this sequel was in planning or when it was decided, but thats the situation as i see it. all that differntiates from teen slashers is that we know who is doing the killings, but that was taken out of the \"first\". so theres no originality there. what is really bad about this film is that it tells you that bateman actually did the killings in the true american psycho. the only person who has the right to say whether patrick really did commit the murders or not is ellis. he was the author of the original american psycho story, therefore only he should decide. i read that ellis in fact, stated that in the novel, all that actually ever happened was that bateman might have horrible thoughts of you and draw horrible pictures as well. that the killings did not really take place was also conveyed (as i saw it) in the original. so do not all we who executed the sequel feel silly now? and even though i have called this a sequel (for ease of writing) i do not recognise it as such. as far as i am concerned we left the world of bateman in the novel when the final page was turned (even though i never read it properly), and in the film when the end credits began rolling. until ellis writes a continuation of american psycho, to me bateman is alive and kicking. see only if you are absoloutely desparate or want to write a critical review of a movie. otherwise avoid at all costs.',\n"," 'for starters and for the record, the term \"necromancy\" describes the black magic art of bringing the dead back to life and it does not, in any way, relate to having sex with cadavers. that is called necrophilia and, yes, i know it\\'s an obvious difference but i am already getting a lot of remarks from acquaintances and relatives that i sport a perverted taste in movies! this movie is quite the opposite of perverted or sleazy, in fact, and merely just qualifies as boring, inept and terribly bad. \"necromancy\" makes at least one top five ranking, namely in the list of most incoherent movies ever made! now, director bert i. gordon is not exactly famous for delivering masterpieces (on his repertoire there are titles like \"earth vs. the spider\", \"king dinosaur\" and \"food of the gods\") but he really surpassed himself here with a totally senseless, redundant and utterly nonsensical tale about witchcraft and secretive little towns. shortly after the tragic experience of seeing their baby being born dead, lori and her husband frank move to the quiet little town of lillith, where frank suddenly got offered a prominent job in a toy factory. lori is suspicious and senses an atmosphere of morbidity, especially with the town\\'s patriarch and \"owner\" mr. cato behaving very obtrusive and mysterious. that\\'s another thing. how can anybody \"own\" a town and everybody in it? either way, lori gradually discovers that everybody in lillith is a witch and mr. cato exclusively lured her to the town because of her supernatural ability to resurrect the dead. since many years already, cato has been trying to bring his deceased son back to life and he\\'s prepared to make any human sacrifice it takes. i honestly do not see the point of the whole movie. it\\'s a blatant rip-off of \"rosemary\\'s baby\" one of the alternate titles even is \"rosemary\\'s disciples\" but the script is muddled and imbecilic beyond belief. why is not anyone allowed to have children for as long as cato\\'s son remains dead? that\\'s just really selfish! when, where and how did lori suddenly learn to resurrect the dead? \"necromancy\" definitely contains a few genuinely uncanny and atmospheric moments, but these are unwarily accomplished either by complete coincidence or through a total lack of budget. the grainy photography provides the film with an eerie ambiance and the set pieces look cheap enough to be creepy. orson welles\\' performance undoubtedly the low point of his career is pitiable, and still it\\'s the best aspect about the entire movie.',\n"," 'so many films

and marty (mike binder) are a regular couple with an ordinary sex life. but marty is obsessed with a fantasy where he and laura have a threesome with another woman. he goads her semi-seriously and when she finally shows some interest, he convinces her to invite over a girl from work who has been coming on to her. but marty soon learns that you have to be careful what you wish for. after an initial reluctance, laura gets into it and finds she likes it. we are talking serious liking here. marty is initially ecstatic that his fantasy has been fulfilled, but now that he has opened pandora's box (so to speak), he is not prepared for the sex monster that emerges. laura becomes a sex crazed lesbian nymphomaniac and proceeds to seduce all their female friends. this leads to numerous awkward situations, some zany, some silly and some just downright hilarious. this film is just rollicking good fun. the sex is mostly implied, so if you were hoping to see mariel hemingway or anyone else naked, you are pretty much out of luck. there is a lot of moaning and bed shaking but nothing really provocative other than a couple of girl kissing scenes. but explicit sex is not what this movie is about. it's about the comedy, and the comedy works, so it is just as well. this is really the mike binder show. he wrote, directed and starred in the film. he did not really excel in any of these roles, but somehow the whole exceeded the sum of the parts. he gave a generally droll performance which was occasionally terrible but more often comical. he was at his best when he was being tormented by laura's obsession as he tried desperately to get the sex genie back in the bottle. mariel hemingway was terrific in this film and made it truly funny. this is her second role with a bisexual theme having appeared in the heavy handed 'personal best' where she was an athlete who alternated between sleeping with her male coach and a female teammate. her performance in this part was far better and she turns out to be a much better comedian than dramatic actress. she has a great ability to make humorous use of her 6 foot frame and made the most of the many sight gags in the script. i rated this movie a 7/10. it does not redefine the genre, but it is a wacky sex farce that has more than its share of funny moments. if you are offended by profanity, sexual situations and lesbianism, you definitely want to skip it. but if you like a light hearted and offbeat roll in the hay flick, you'll probably enjoy it.\",\n"," 'largely dense road movie with some comic relief provided by the

attention to being a successful cookie maker, and of spoofs like \"the lost skeleton of cadavra.\" but i could not find the spark that makes a bad movie great in spaceship (a.k.a. the creature was not

three-part documentary (each episode is 50 minutes) featuring slovenian superstar philosopher/psychoanalyst slavoj zizek. zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films, exploring themes of sexuality, fantasy, morality and mortality. it was directed by sophie fiennes, of the multi-talented fiennes clan (she's sister to actors ralph and joseph). i enjoyed this quite a bit, although i think it will be even more enjoyable on dvd, since there is such a stew of ideas to be digested. freudian and lacanian analysis can be pretty heavy going and seeing the whole series all at once became a bit disorienting by the end of two and a half hours. it did not help that an ill-advised coffee and possession of a bladder led me to some discomfort for the last hour or so. my only real issue with this is that zizek picked films that were quite obviously filled with freudian themes. he spends quite a bit of time on the films of hitchcock and david lynch, not exactly masters of subtlety. i would have liked to see him try to support his theories by using a wider range of films, although that's really just me saying i'd like to see part four and five and six. zizek is very funny, and part of the humour was watching him present what amounted to a lecture while inserting himself into the actual scenes from some of the films he's discussing. so, for instance, we see him in a motorboat on his way to bodega bay (from hitchcock's the birds) or sitting in the basement of the bates motel (from psycho). which is not to say that his theories are not provocative. even when i found myself

luke duke making a moonshine run for uncle jesse (no shine running in the show because it would put the boys back in jail as a parole violation) to the closing sequence of uncle jesse smoking weed

with basic moral values. the original dukes of hazzard was a kid safe, hemi powered, show of fun that parents did not have to worry about teaching their kids george carlin's seven words. i have read reviews stating that the show and the movie are nothing but racist. those commits might be correct about the movie. those commits are absolutely incorrect about the show. the show, if anything, was about how to get along and be friends with anyone. hollywood has finally come out in the open about their disdain for those of us, yankee, rebel, or otherwise, who still believe in honor, loyalty, trust, family, and doing the right thing even if it is not the popular thing. hollywood has finally brought to light its belief that those of us in the heartland are stupid, uneducated, beer swilling, foul mouthed, trash that will buy any piece of garbage they are willing to sell. prove the hollywood elitist that they are wrong. do not go see this movie. boycott the sponsors. fill warner bros.

in your eyes\" sung by the beautiful irene dunne, an elegant old russian restaurant with its frescoes, fashion show that incorporates astaire and rogers dancing, irene dunne\\'s warmth, a witty script, a broadway smash hit brought to the screen - geez, what a movie! it is only recently that i have begun to enjoy musicals. the ones i like are the light ones - not the ones incorporating social issues which i feel musicals are ill-equipped to handle. but a light musical comedy - with exquisite dancing, charming leads, swank clothes, elegant sets, witty dialogue - wow! and this is definitely such a musical - absolutely charming. the four leads are wonderfully cast. irene dunne reminds me of greer garson in having a certain soulfulness combined with innate gentility and enormous warmth - dunne also happens to have had a world-class operatic singing voice (that in later movies, as operettas ceased to be appealing, was seldom heard). there is something so very vulnerable about a wounded irene dunne character - and she is wonderful in this part. randolph scott has a big, clean, very handsome, american quality that is also wonderfully suited to this part - one in which his character is candid, straightforward, easily swayed by others who are sophisticated -but at a certain point will act decisively when he comes to realize his judgment has been mistaken. fred astaire\\'s subordinate comic supporting role is suited well by the enormous difference in size between himself and scott - and obviously his dancing and his easy way with humorous lines is just wonderful. the 24 year old ginger rogers may be the biggest revelation to me - it\\'s not just that she can dance astonishingly well, that she is wonderful (and wonderfully funny) with accents, that she can sing songs equally comically or romantically (and with great gestures), that she is very very funny, whip-smart with dialogue,, but she perfectly suits the job of one hustling for jobs, adapting to all circumstances, rough and ready -- and extremely aware at all times. i think studio heads really saw rogers\\' amazing abilities through the end of world war ii (after which she was shamefully abandoned) - she seldom played the \"classy woman\" and we instead find her as a shop girl, prisoner on furlough, society wannabe, entertainer. i would like to have seen her play in her career, a part in which she more

first was a major sensation in sweden then a big scandal/cause-celebre in the united states when the one print was held by customs and it went all the way to the supreme court. what\\'s potent in the picture today is not so much what might offend by way of what\\'s revealed in the sex or nudity- the director/\"actor\" vilgot sjoman films the various scenes in such a way that there is an abundance of flesh and genitalia and the occasional graphic bit but it\\'s always more-so an intellectual expression than very lust-like- but the daring of the attempt at a pure \\'metafilm\\' while at the same time making a true statement on the state of affairs in sweden. who knew such things in a generally peaceful country (i.e. usually neutral in foreign affairs and wars) could be so heated-up politically? at least, that\\'s part of sjoman\\'s aim here. like a filmmaker such as dusan makavajev with some of his works like w.r. (if not as surreal and deranged) or to a slightly lesser extent bertolucci, sjoman is out to mix politics and sex (mostly politics and social strata) around in the midst of also making it a comment on embodying a character in a film. the two characters, lena and borje, have a hot-cold relationship in the story of the film, where lena is a \"curious\" socialist-wannabe who demonstrates in the street for nonviolence and \\'trains\\' sort of in a cabin in the woods to become a fully functioning one, while at the same time maybe too curious about her car salesman boyfriend. and as this is going on, which is by itself enough for one movie, sjoman inserts himself and his crew from time to time as they are making this story on film (there\\'s even a great bit midway through where, as if at a rock concert, title cards fill in during a break in shooting who the crew are, negating having to use end credits!) then with this there\\'s a whole other dynamic as sjoman gives an actual performance, not just a \"hey, i am the director playing the director\" bit. at first, one might not get this structure and that i am curious (yellow) is just a film where lena is a documentary interviewer asking subjects about their thoughts on class, socialism, spain and franco, and once in a while we see lena\\'s father or bjore. but sjoman does something interesting: the structure is so slippery as the viewer one has to stay on toes; it\\'s impressive that so many years on a picture can surprise with not being afraid to mix dramatic narrative, documentary, film-within-a-film, and even a serious interview with martin luther king, who also acts as a quasi-guru for lena. it might not always be completely coherent analysis politically, but it does not feel cheating or even with much of a satirical agenda like in a godard picture; the satire sjoman is after is akin to a godard but on a whole other wavelength. his anarchy is playful but not completely loaded with semantics or tricks that could put off the less initiated viewer. if i am curious (yellow) stands up as an intellectual enterprise and a full-blown trip into exploring sex in a manner that was and is captivating for how much is shown and how comfortable it all seems to be for the actors, it is not entirely successful, i think, as an emotional experience. where bergman had it down to a t with making a purely emotional film with deconstruction tendencies, sjoman is more apt at connecting with specific ideas while not actually directing always very well when it comes time to do big or subtle scenes with the actors. occasionally it works if only for the actors, lena nyman (mostly spectacular here in a performance that asks of her to make an ambitious but confused kid into someone sympathetic and vulnerable even) and borje ahlstedt (a great realistic counterpoint to the volatile lena), but some 40 years later its hard to completely connect with everything that happens in the inner-film of lena and borje since (perhaps intentionally) sjoman fills it up with clichés (borje has a girlfriend and kid, will he leave her, how will lena reconcile her father) and a heavy-handed narration from his starlet of sorts. and yet, for whatever faults sjoman may have, ironically considering he means it to be a comment on itself, i am curious (yellow) holds up beautifully as an artistic experiment in testing the waters of what could be done in swedish cinema, or testing what could not be and bending it for provocative and comedic usage. i\\'d even go as far as to say it\\'s influential, and has probably been copied or imitated in more ways than one due to it being such a cult phenomenon at its time (a specific technique used, with the film rewinding towards the end, is echoed in poorer usage in funny games), and should be seen by anyone looking into getting into avant-garde or meta-film-making. if it\\'s not quite as outstanding an artistic leap as w.r. or last tango, it\\'s close behind.',\n"," \"this is a documentary i came across by chance on the uk tv channel more4 and i have to say i found it extremely interesting and thought provoking. i will also be seeking out the book that was the source

argued about how the fortune of the right crops and the right animals that where able to domesticated is certainly a compelling one. as for the documentary itself it is well shot and well narrated with not to much of the re-created scenes that spoil many a modern documentary. diamond also helps by not being to condescending which is a fault of a lot of intellectuals when trying to get a message to the masses. people have claimed his theory is marxist but i do not buy this and see it more socio geologist. it was also refreshing to hear an theory on the evolution of society not based around

'do not listen to the misleading title \"werewolf woman\". the europeans are well known for putting an emphasis on sex and nudity over actual scares in their horror films, but this one here is just a bit too much. \"werewolf woman\" seems to have a sleazy sex scene copped off with the title character going crazy and brutally killing her partner. fun the first few times, but a hundred minutes of this becomes very monotonous quickly. shes not even a werewolf, but a schizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy. the film can not even decide its tone, with the first ten minutes (a flashback) being legitimate supernatural horror (i thought i was in for a trash classic after these) to a rather poor character study of the female being repeatedly abused and tortured to a revenge thriller. at the end, the director insists this is based on a true story. yeah, all right. to be fair, there are a few entertaining aspects of the production. the title werewolf woman is a looker and there are a few nice gore effects and nude scenes. however, these become rather monotonous quickly. also, the dubbed dialog is pretty hilarious in a camp fashion, especially the worlds most swinging doctor (he drinks on the job). unfortunately, the film becomes pretty irritating fast. there\\'s no actual plot or anything else really. its a shame, because reading a description i felt the film had some real potential. \"werewolf woman\" is far overlong, slow moving, and a bit too pointless, even by the standards of the exploitation genre. (4/10)',\n"," 'man, i really wanted to like these shows. i am starving for some good television and i applaud tnt for providing these \"opportunites\". but, sadly, i am in the minority i guess when it comes to the cinematic stephen king. as brilliant as king\\'s writing is, the irony is that it simply does not translate well to the screen, big or small. with few exceptions (very few), the king experience cannot be filmed with the same impact that the stories have when read. many people would disagree with this, but i am sure that in their heart of hearts they have to admit that the best filmed king story is but a pale memory of the one they read. the reason is simple. the average king story takes place in the mind-scape of the characters in the story. he gives us glimpses of their inner thoughts, their emotions and their sometimes fractured or unreal points of view. in short, king takes the reader places where you can not put a panavision camera. as an audience watching the filmed king, we are left with less than half the information than the reader has access to. it\\'s not too far a stretch to claim that one becomes a character in a king story they read, whereas one is limited to petty voyeurism of that same character when filmed. for as long as king writes, hollywood will try shooting everything that comes out of his word processor, without any regard to whether or not they should. i do not blame the filmmakers for trying, but it takes an incredible amount of talent and circumspection to pull off the elusive stephen king adaptation that works. the task is akin to turning lead into gold, or some arcane zen mastery. oh well, better luck next time.',\n"," 'first off, i have to say that i really like the idea of rock-a-doodle. the basic story of the rooster having to save his farm from eternal darkness and rain by crowing the sun up could have made for such a great movie. but i feel that, as it was, it was not nearly as good a movie as it could have been. a huge part of my problem with this movie was the main character, edmund. this kid/cat is so darn annoying. his speech impediment got very old very fast, and it just felt like he was trying way too hard to sound cute. also, as another reviewer pointed out earlier, he belabored to death the fact that he was \"too little\" to do pretty much anything, which became irritating. it was also bothersome that this movie could not decide whether it wanted to be a full-blown musical or not. the chanticleer/king songs were fine, because they were part of the whole singing rooster story. but it seemed that the other random songs were pretty unnecessary. the owls\\' songs were bad enough, but did they really feel the need to have the bit with the bouncer toads\\' song? these random musical numbers felt like they came out of some particularly bad gilbert and sullivan operetta. if they really wanted to make this movie a musical, they needed to have some real full-length songs instead of those short musical snippets given to the villains. but by far, my biggest problem with this movie is that it\\'s just not very good at storytelling. it was fine that patou (phil harris in his last role!) narrated the story. however, at times, they relied too much on the narration to tell us things instead of showing us. this is especially true in the whole goldie subplot. patou told us that a) goldie was a lot smarter and nicer than she seemed at first and b) that she was really falling for chanticleer although she was only supposed to fake it. it really would have helped goldie\\'s character development if there had been scenes where she was gradually acting smarter and nicer. and the movie would instantly have been better, i believe, if there had been a scene showing the moment where goldie knew that she was in love with chanticleer for real instead of just having narration. as it was, it felt like goldie was just tacked onto the movie so that chanticleer could have a love interest. there\\'s a good movie somewhere in rock-a-doodle. and i will not deny that it was a special part of many people\\'s childhoods. however, for the reasons above (as well as others i do not care to bore you with), it just did not live up to that potential, and turned out to be just another mediocre-to-bad kids\\' movie.',\n"," \"! spoiler alert! the point is, though, that i did not think

(usually 'splatter') and nowadays they can pack every second with gaudy special effects. one of the goals of a really good horror flick is to suspend the sense of disbelief of the audience. for instance, i saw both of the recent mummy movies and nearly got dizzy viewing ridiculous special effects every second. it probably costs a million dollars per second to make those movies and my sense of disbelief was never suspended, it grew roots. subtlety can be more terrifying. less is more. i first saw 'the woman in black' on the a&e channel. after flipping through the usual 987 channels of very bad television i stopped to watch it. this movie almost has the feel of a 'masterpiece theater' production. that was fine with me, i have always preferred british tv & movies anyway. most viewers would find this to be too slowly paced. but the slow pacing helps give the story credibility. the special effects are few which lulls the viewer into thinking that this film is set in the real world thus making us a bit more uneasy. the makeup and costume for the ghost are kept simple and believable. hollywood would have made her look like a she demon from hell with glowing eyes-fangs-claws etc. hollywood would have done an overkill and turned this idea into a mediocrity. the woman only makes about five appearances in the film. most of them are where she appears in the distance and even that creates a good fright. if she appeared too often, it could have cheapened the mood that gets set. however this movie is so well made that through much of the film we are led into sensing that she is there the whole time but not visible. the scene where she 'visits' arthur kidd late at night and we see her just a little too close is a masterpiece in horror. this is just an extraordinary film that i think should rate as one the finest horror films ever made. i have a copy of 'the haunting', 'the changling' and a zillion more. i have not seen anything that tops 'the woman in black' yet although i am still looking. this movie is so well made that it gives even the most hardened skeptic (like me) a moment where i almost had second thoughts about the non-existence of ghosts. i joke to people that i occasionally get brief fears that she could appear standing in the middle of the road or that i'd see her staring through my window, etc. maybe she could be in a crowd at the mall glaring at me with her look of hate. this is how a really great horror film should be. like a lafanu novel, the woman in black very slowly pulls you in and wraps herself around your neck and before you realize it, she's squeezing the life out of you and then it's too late. closest thing i have to a criticism is that this was made for the small screen... and it's a terrible shame that this is out of print. i just paid over $40 for my second copy of this movie. it's a major prize in my collection. now i am on a quest to find an even better horror movie that not only gives the chills but also qualifies a sound drama.\",\n"," 'i thought that this movie was going to be totally lame based on the advertisements that i saw in theaters. when my sister borrowed from a friend i decided to watch it because it

\"russian mafia\" hit-man contribute nothing to the storyline and could easily have been left out. the avenging brother would have been enough, and was not fleshed out. liotta showing remorse, trying to befriend and help the man he shot and crippled, beginning to live a normal life, only to have the angry brother whose life was ruined bent on revenge... now that could have been a good movie. do we really need to know the dafoe character\\'s personal life? what does this contribute? the way he tells the story of his murdered son should be shown to acting students as an example of bad \"mailing it in\" acting. \"he looked up at me and said, i\\'ll be alright dad... and then he died.\" this only exists to prop up the cheesy end scene, which should never have been included. a better ending would be to have liotta die, and that\\'s it! gee, the undercover guys driving around in a large dark colored van. how original. and the pursuers all driving identical black sedans. not original at all... and the \"blood dripping on the shoulder\" flashback scene was shown far too often. gotta justify that cgi expenditure, i suppose. why were the drugs taken as pills? why not injections to make sure? why was the doctor allowed to go into liotta\\'s cell where he could be easily attacked? how is it that defoe was beaten by liotta the first time, but the second time dafoe suddenly gets fighting skills and beats liotta to a pulp? ah, there is plenty more to pick at, but to save time, stay away from this one.',\n"," 'this is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it. that would be fine if the film were a travelogue, but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry, that is not good enough. the theme of inter-species respect and co-operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter-species love, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species. as with many films, one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter. alas, we probably will never know.',\n"," 'as the most recent installment of mystery science theater 3000 movies i have seen (parts: the clonus horror does not count because i have already seen it) i immediately went out and rented this movie after i saw the show. i wanted to see this movie as it was originally made if i wanted to form an honest opinion about it. and, after seeing this movie twice, i have come to the conclusion that this movie was not so terrible. \"but it has such a low rating! you are just not an easy critic!\" no i am not. i consider myself to be very harsh. in some of my other reviews i have bombarded movies to no end with my opinions. i simply feel that a movie should automatically be voted so low merely because it was shown on mst 3k. on the imdb scale of 1-10, i gave this movie a three (3) and here\\'s why. this movie has a decent plot. no, the plot\\'s not the journey of tee to the lost cellar, it\\'s not the victories over lord voltaire and it\\'s definitely not the delta knights attempting to bring about the new renaissance (they could have done that years before if they had not waited for tee to come around). this movie\\'s decent plot was the back story of how the lost storehouse came to be, through their inventions and writings of archimedes and the technology of the lost continent atlantis. that is where the story induces interest into me. i think it\\'s interesting to have a story where leonardo da vinci was really a thief of good ideas and archimedes was the real genius. it\\'s a new twist on old facts, and therefore it deserves some credit. i think if this movie had more of a budget, it could have been made into a very decent picture. the mst3k viewing of this movie produced two of the funniest quotes i have ever heard from the show. both quotes came from the scene where baydool comes out of the bathroom holding his pan of pee and pearl exclaims \"eww! wizard wiz...\" i think the house shook i was laughing so hard. but then, not five seconds later, he threw his urine on the guy trying to steal tee and baydool makes the goofiest and tom says \"that\\'s my pee!\" after that i lost it. i was rolling on the floor, stuffing my face into my pillow trying to muffle my laughter. boy those two quotes really made that one episode worth watching because most of the stuff after that was not really that great. i would actually prefer to watch the movie without mike, tom and crow and make my own jokes instead of having the show tell me what\\'s funny about the movie. i would much rather use my own humor to make my own jokes to degrade this movie. all-in-all, i think you people judged this movie too harshly. a movie being on mst3k does not necessarily qualify it for being a terrible movie. thank you and good day. -scott-',\n"," 'first off, i am amazed to see that this film has got a rating of 7 on this site. at first i thought it might be industry people logging in to imdb and jacking up the rating. but after looking on rotten tomatoes and seeing that this film has something like a 76% approval rating, it seems that maybe folks have just been duped again into mistaking pretentious crap for profundity. i mean, this film is simply awful. the acting is simply terrible, but the rest of the film is worse. at least the acting provides some (unintentional) laughs. the plot involves a teenage skateboarding boy who is being questioned along with his friends for a murder that happened by a park where they skate. and that\\'s about it. the rest of the film consists of the aforementioned terrible acting, terrible dialog, slow motion shots of people walking, of people\\'s faces, of people skating, often set to music that does not fit the scene. perhaps that was done to be \"cool\" or experimental or hip. or perhaps it was done in hopes that it would fool people into thinking that it is somehow profound, but it does not work. nothing in this film works. it\\'s pretentious garbage. i can not not recommend it enough.',\n"," 'if you enjoy japanese horror than this film is highly

going to be a complete and utter waste of my time. my hopes were not only dashed, but they were also horrifically bludgeoned to death by a blunt club. i found the acting to be quite over-dramatic and at some points forced. their performances were about as novice as a 13 year old boy trying to remove his girlfriend\\'s bra. i am actually being very kind in my criticisms. i find that when a movie is poorly written no manner of great acting can save it, not that there was any great acting in \"contagion.\" the writing and dialogue were stilted and hackneyed. this movie explains why the writer has not done anything after writing it. there was no believability in the storyline at some points. there were more holes in the storyline than on a small town\\'s main street. there was no connection or storyline between the climax of the movie and the denouement. it was like they had been running out of money around the end so they had to quickly end the movie. the science in the movie was deplorable. i believe that if your going to write a movie involving science that you should at least get information from a reliable source to back your writing. i know that not all movies are 100% scientifically correct, but at least make an actual attempt to be somewhat realistic. like how the intelligent and ,of course, beautiful virus doctor took the dying nurse\\'s locket to give to the nurse\\'s daughter, and she did not even disinfect it or keep it in the quaranteed area. i advise that no one should ever view this movie again, because it is an insult to cinema and all we hold dear about movies. i give this movie a f minus (which is saying a lot for the movie). any movie that needs an overly precocious and mischievous child actor(how nauseatingly hollywood) to make people warm up to the movie should never be seen. alison h.',\n"," \"while watching the wise little hen, i had to keep reminding myself that this short was made in 1934. the animation has held up well over the

characters. but naturally there's a tall, dark and handsome stranger to keep up the love interest, and this wicked lady is not backward in coming forward when she meets the right man. the wishy-washy

wonderful film and amazing to look at even today for its technical prowess. unfortunately for this film, though, the remake starring sabu was an even better film and was overshadowed a bit because of this. douglas fairbanks, sr. plays the thief. he is a real scoundrel and not particularly likable,... that is, until he meets the woman of his dreams, the princess. he vows to straighten up his life after he introduces himself to her--beginning by telling her the awful truth about his life. despite this, the princess is head-over-heels in love with him--thanks to his fulfilling a prophecy made earlier in the film about the identity of her beloved. however, daddy is not pleased with the thief and has him beaten and thrown from the castle. other, less wonderful real princes are left to vie for hand. however, she wants douglas and comes up with a plan to send all of them on a chase to bring back the greatest treasure. douglas decides to enter this contest as well--and due to his new-found goodness is able to make himself a prince and win her lovely hand. the film fades out as they take a very spectacular magic carpet ride away from the city of baghdad. the film strongly excels artistically. the city appears huge and grand and generally very real. the special effects are also top notch. fairbanks is also incredible with his athletic prowess as he effortlessly climbs ropes, battles silly looking monsters (the only minor drawback among the many special effects) and leaps about the scenery. about the only other minor negative is that occasionally, fairbanks' performance is perhaps too athletic--as he did not do quite a convincing job with the love scenes and quieter moments in the film. still, it's a silent masterpiece.\",\n"," 'thumb tripping is a little-known hippie road movie made in 1972. it\\'s little-known for a reason. the reason is that it is somewhat poor... and those who saw it (of which there were few) did not build for it a word-of-mouth reputation of any note. there are a few cast members in it who went on to bigger and better things, notably meg foster and bruce dern; also the director quentin masters would later score a sexploitation hit with the joan collins movie the stud. however, in this film there is very little of interest other than a freewheeling narrative that offers occasional insights into the permissive and casual attitudes of the youth of the late \\'60s/early \\'70s. in most departments, thumb tripping is a tedious, dated, muddled and totally forgettable misfire. young hitch-hikers gary (michael burns) and chay (meg foster) make their way around california together, hitching rides when they can and spending evenings under the stars. gary is a kid from a decent background and a home in connecticut who has chosen to postpone going to college in order to \"discover himself\"; chay is a more freewheeling type who just wants to experience the here-and-now while she is still young. during their wanderings, gary and chay come across various weird types and sometimes find themselves caught up in bizarre adventures. they are picked up by road-racers smitty (bruce dern) and simp (larry hankin) who threatens them with a switchblade; later they hitch a lift from an embittered woman (joyce van patten) who has hated hippies since her daughter ran away to become one; another time chay finds herself being ogled by a middle-aged trucker (mike conrad); and in their final \"thumb trip\", they find themselves travelling with dysfunctional husband-and-wife alcoholics (mariana hill and burke burns). the episodes come and go without leaving much of an impression, partly due to the fuzzy soundtrack (which renders much of the dialogue inaudible) and partly because of the thoroughly uninteresting main characters. michael burns gives a non-performance that may one day be recommended by doctors as a cure for insomnia, while foster fares little better as a dislikable female lead whose character seems to think she\\'s free and happy but in reality is just a self-centred slut. the gallery of background characters are far more fascinating than these two, but they come and go too quickly to make much of an impact. the script (by don mitchell, from his own novel) has no idea where it\\'s going and merely ambles along from one pointless situation to another. where easy rider was similarly plot less and freewheeling, at least it had interesting characters and situations, and charismatic performers. thumb tripping has none of that and is a very tough film to endure from low-key beginning to unsatisfying end.',\n"," \"i just saw jamaica inn (1939) and was shocked to find it right at home at any exploitation film fest. while it was directed by hitchcock, it does not feel like a hitchcock movie at all, and the true auteurs of the film are the dialogue writer (separate from screenplay writer in the credits), sidney gilliat, and the star, who is also the villain, charles laughton. the dialogue seemed straight out of a clockwork orange, as if both films take place in the same alternate universe. one character in particular sounded like one of alex's droogs. coupled with this fantastic dialogue was one of my top ten favorite villains in movie history. charles laughton chewed the #$*! out of the scenery in this role, with better-than-perfect comic timing and a villainous role straight out of an exploitation film. while not technically an exploitation film, i think you could only get into it by watching it in the same way you would watch an exploitation film, otherwise you probably would not 'get it' and think it was just some early undeveloped hitch film. for example, i thought the last 10 minutes or so of laughton kidnapping maureen o'hara's character was just a 1930's metaphorical way of filming an exploitation rape scene. just watch the way laughton does the most insanely despicable things and seems to have the most blasé and yet innocently boyish fun doing it. play this in the middle of a triple bill of 1970's exploitation films and it would feel right at home. probably the only way to watch it. viewing this instead as most people do, as hitchcock-in-development, will probably only lead to disappointment, as can be seen from other user comments.\",\n"," 'i am so disappointed in this movie i can not express it. i was so

nothing. nothing. aahhgg!',\n"," 'uta hagen\\'s \"respect for acting\" is the standard textbook in many college theater courses. in the book, hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor: the presentational approach, and the representational approach. in the presentational approach, the actor focuses on realizing the character as honestly as possible, by introducing emotional elements from the actor\\'s own life. in the representational approach, the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion, through a high degree of control of movement and sound. the representational approach to acting was still partially in vogue when this hamlet was made. british theater has a long history of this style of acting, and olivier could be said to be the ultimate king of the representational school. time has not been kind to this school of acting, or to this movie. nearly every working actor today uses a presentational approach. to the modern eye, olivier\\'s highly enunciated, stylized delivery is stodgy, stiff and stilted. instead of creating an internally conflicted hamlet, olivier made a declaiming, self-important bullhorn out of the melancholy dane -- an acting style that would have carried well to the backs of the larger london theaters, but is far too starchy to carry off a modern hamlet. and so the movie creaks along ungainfully today. olivier\\'s tendency to e-nun-ci-ate makes some of hamlet\\'s lines unintentionally funny: \"in-stead, you must ac-quire and be-get a tem-purr-ance that may give it... smooth-ness!\" instead of crying at meeting his father\\'s ghost (as any proper actor could), bright fill lights in olivier\\'s pupils give us that impression. eileen herlie is the only other actor of note in this hamlet, putting in a good essay at the queen, despite the painfully obvious age differences (he was 41; she was 26). the other actors in this movie have no chance to get anything else of significance done, given olivier\\'s tendency to want to keep! the camera! on him! at all! times! sixty years later, you feel the insecurity of the shakespearean stage actor who lacked the confidence to portray a breakable, flawed hamlet, and instead elected to portray a sort of elizabethan bullhorn. final analysis: \"i would have such a fellow whipped for o\\'er-doing termagant; it out-herods

a js's show (ie there is no plot) but the acting is wicked, it's hilarious and it's all in all an incredible trash movie. it says as much about america than a bully or a ken park without the drama

festival togather and show this film there. abingdon is two and a hour hours from where i live, but the trip was worth it in every sense of the word. uzak/distant is an amazing, brilliant, jarring, emotional, captivating film. as a turkish-american, this film was not only a testimony as to what life in turkey is like; but on a larger scale it tells the world of what it is like to be turkish whether one lives in istanbul, berlin, montreal, new york, or omaha. it may be two hours in length as opposed to five minutes, but this is effectively our bob marley song. there are so many wonderful scenes in this film. it is very difficult to choose just a random few. but, for me, one telling scene takes place in a beyoglu (downtown istanbul) cinema. the title character, played by mehmet emin toprak who sadly died in a car accident shortly after this film\\'s completion, follows a very attractive young woman down a staircase to the cinema\\'s main auditorium. she goes into see \"vanilla sky.\" as the image of tom cruise is reflected from a glass, we sense that turkish men are competing with tom cruise for their own women\\'s affections even though tom cruise is nowhere to found in beyoglu. the scenes shot across the bosphorous shores are also quite revealing as they symbolize the beauty, yet desperate empty gulfs, which are a painful fact of life in turkey. in this film, the gulf separates lovers and families. a simple, empty packet of samsun (turkish brand) cigarettes and a dying mouse jump off the screen the way seagulls did in the 1982 serif goren-yilmaz guney film \"yol.\" many of guney\\'s films, including \"yol,\" \"suru- the herd\" (1978- completed by zeki okten) and \"baba-the father\" (1971) have been considered by many to be the best turkish films ever made. without guney\\'s sometimes overblown social-political anger (especially in his last film, the 1983 prison drama \"duvar-the wall\"), \"distance\" captures the essence of turkish life quite remarkably. this is a crowning achievement for a director who in my view can already be proclaimed as the turkish equivalent to directors like tarkovsky, bresson, and ozu. i can not wait to see his

romantic comedy genre has thrown our way. laughs are supposed to ensue just when you thought hollywood has reached an all time low comes \"date movie,\" a movie that proves that anything can be made into a film in hollywood and no matter how bad something is people will dish out their hard earned money to see it. \"date movie\" is by far the worst pile of crap i have seen in several years and can possibly go down in the history of film as being one of the worst movies ever made. this movie contained zero laughs, none of the spoofs were even remotely funny. it was an insult to anyone who dished out any kind of money to see this film. the saddest part about all of this is that i knew before seeing this movie that it was going to be bad but i did not think it could ever be as bad as it actually was. all the jokes fell flat and half way through its groundbreaking 75 minute running time i wanted to find a way to end my life so i would not have to sit through another second of this horrid movie. there really is not a positive thing i can say about this movie. the first question that comes to mind though is who the hell came up with the idea. why spoof comedies? comedies are already funny so why spoof them? this is a question i wondered when i first heard about the movie and now after seeing \"date movie\" i know it can not be done and should not even be attempted. while \"date movie\" only runs 75 minutes they try to spoof everything they can including bridget jones\\'s diary, kill bill, say anything, my best friend\\'s wedding, napoleon dynamite, how to lose a guy in 10 days, my big fat greek wedding, hitch, the bachelor, meet the parents, sleepless in seattle, rize, king kong, wedding planner and so many more. you would think that one joke would work but in all honesty not a single one did. you just sit there staring at the screen, losing your brain cells, and wondering how on earth someone got money to produce this pile of garbage. i guess you should know that a movie is really bad when it\\'s not screened for critics and the trailer tries to sell you a movie by saying \"from 2 of the 6 writers of scary movie\" but there is always that small part of me that says it can not be as bad as it looks but in this case it\\'s worse than it looks. it\\'s a train wreck and if anyone finds this movie funny i am sorry but there must be something seriously wrong with you or you are just so incredibly immature. this movie took 2 people to write and two people to direct. if i ever meet jason friedberg or aaron seltzer the writers and directors behind this crap i will demand that they give me my $6.75 back for paying to see this movie. these guys have no right what so ever to make a movie when they put out a movie like \"date movie.\" there should be a law in hollywood that if your movie is hated by both critics and audiences alike that you should be placed in a cell and beaten until you write everyone who watched your film a huge letter of apology. i really wonder what crap can come out of hollywood next that can be worse than this film. so to sum it up, \"date movie\" sucks, plain and simple. even if you see it with little or no expectations you will be disappointed. i despise everyone who was involved with this movie from the entire cast who somehow read this script and said this is going to be good to the interns who did not walk off the set after the first day of shooting. why is it that we have to suffer through movies that are this bad? and hollywood wonders why ticket sales are going down because when you pay $6-$10 to see a

\"gigli,\" \"batman and robin\" and \"you got served.\" moviemanmenzel\\'s final rating for \"date movie\" is a 0 out of ten. this movie does not even deserve a 1 because nothing worked at all and

from the abyss appears over a moving image & in the same font type as the rest of the credits, starts with five 20 something kids, mike (clay rogers) his girlfriend margaret (sharon twomey), sisters julie (ann wolf) & dorothy (loren depalm) & an annoying idiot named bobby (michael bon) whom decide to all fit into a small rubber boat & head out to sea, do not ask why as i do not know. oh & the complete idiot bobby left the petrol behind & never thought to tell anyone so it comes as no great surprise that they end up stranded out at sea without any petrol for the motor & to make matters worse they become trapped in a thunder storm & discover a dead body floating in the water. shortly after their luck seems to change when they come across a yacht & potential safety, in a flash everyone boards the yacht & begin to explore. first of all they find a scientific lab with various fish specimens & computer equipment, then down below they find fully furnished & luxurious cabins. they find a chemist (deran sarafian) who appears mad & can not talk. they eat fish from the fridge which makes dorothy puke up green vomit, beetles & slugs. they learn that these fish are living fossil's 1000's of years old & have been contaminated by toxic waste dumped in the sea & that they fly, mutate, bite & are generally unpleasant to be around. i really can not be bothered to go on with this plot outline so i will not, here's what i think... this italian production was produced & directed by massimiliano cerchi under the pseudonym al passeri (i'd hide under a different name if i made a film this bad too) & i think plankton is quite simply one of the worst films ever, there are so many things wrong with this film it's difficult to know where to start. first the script by richard baumann is total crap, it makes no sense whatsoever & is so slow & dull it was torture for me to sit through. why would five people just simply set sail for the middle of the ocean on a rubber dinghy barely big enough to fit them all in? what were they planning on doing exactly? why do we often get point-of-view shots from these fish creatures but they seem to be totally invisible to the characters as they are never shown on screen even though they are right next to a character, & how do these fish get around the boat as there is no water for them to swim in? people's actions & reactions to things are all wrong, they constantly split up, they make bizarre decisions that simply do not make any sense in the situation they find themselves in & some of the dialogue is as awful as anything i have heard. i could go on all day about all the plot holes & ridiculous goings on but i'll run out of space if i do. the fish creatures themselves look awful, a mixture of rubbish rubber puppets & some really bad stop motion animation at the end, the scenes where they interact with the human cast also look terrible with some bad super imposition. i have heard a lot of comments saying that plankton is gory, do not make me laugh! forget it there is virtually no blood or gore in plankton whatsoever, there are a couple of slimy scenes when bobby transforms into a fish monster while having sex with julie but it's pretty brief & he does not kill her, he just sort of drips slime on her, grows a couple of tentacles & a fish head comes out of his mouth. later on julie's vagina starts to drip some dark slime but that's it, we never get to actually see what happens to her or what the slime is. dorothy has a fish creature come out of her back, off screen, & control her but again we never get to see what happens to her while margaret commits suicide, a very brief shot of a plastic harpoon stuck to her forehead. easily the grossest scene is when dorothy pukes up that green stuff with what looks like beetles & slugs in it. that's it, only one person actually dies on screen & for the most part plankton is quite tame & as exciting as watching paint dry & i nearly fell asleep it's so boring. i can not see how anybody can like this total crap, i just can not. the acting is awful, the dubbing is awful, the characters are awful & i hated all of them. tecnically plankton is predictably crap as well, with an estimated budget of only $250,000 all i can say is where did the money go? the sets are monotonous & dull with one lab & a few cabins, the special effect's are bottom of the barrel stuff including the most fake looking exploding boat ever, the cinematography is bland, the music sucks there is zero atmosphere or tension & as a whole plankton, like it's name sake, is as low in the food chain as it could possibly be. i hate plankton, it's awful in every single aspect of it's overlong 86 minute duration. do yourself a favour & avoid this one at all costs unless your

really nothing new or unexpected here. in fact, it becomes disappointingly predictable, as if torn from the news. the biggest problem with having pretty maria alche\\' in the lead role is that she

side of a sheiks harem. it is insulting to women and completely demeans them. spoiler alert i was most surprised by jennifer garner\\'s character. for 7 seasons she played the strong kick ass sydney bristow, i would have thought she could spot a weak character. also jennifer\\'s character is hardly a starring role, but more of a prop ready to serve the wants of matthew mcconaughey\\'s character. we are lead to believe that jennifer and matthew were childhood sweethearts (that never kissed) who lost touch at 14 then reconnected at 24 when he not only breaks her heart but actually destroys her. he courts her, she falls for him, then after sex he bails and never speaks to her again. years later he is the best man and she is the maid of honor at his brothers wedding. when she gets her first glimpse of him (after years of silence), she is all glassy eyed and love struck. the rest of the movie she pines for him. there is no big moment where she unleashes on him. there is no big moment where she realizes he is the one for her. she apparently has been waiting in the wings for him to realize she is the one. the character played by lacey chabert is a bridezilla who is unable to control herself and her emotions. thankfully the three men in her life are there to knock sense back in her. the three bridesmaids are dimwits pining to sleep with matthew and when that fails they scrape the bottom of the barrel groomsmen because they just need a man. the only strong female character is the mother of the bride played by anne archer. she goes toe to toe with mathew and puts him in his place. but what is his place? why is it assumed that a guy who lives life as a player lives an empty life? matthew was blissfully enjoying his life until the ghosts started pointing out his flaws. and we all have flaws. not like this guy was date raping girls. you could claim he mistreated women but he never hid that and the women in the movie like it, so he\\'s got their approval. he breaks up with 3 girls on a conference call in front of a fourth girl and after such a despicable act, the fourth girl still wants to sleep with him. in another scene he orders a bridesmaid to his room to prepare for sex, she happily obliges. why does that make him flawed? before the ghosts show up he is living a pretty happy life. he gets paid well, loves his job and he loves women. later we learn that he lived to a ripe old age, so his antics never killed him. speaking of his funeral, the scene is laughable. only one person shows? please! he was great at his job, a top fashion photographer, and was a hero to all the players. his funeral would be filled with people. they try to portray him as a mean ass, because he supposedly gets drunk and shares his real feelings about marriage. the scene is out of his character. prior to this he says with affection that he would not miss his little brothers wedding, now he\\'s saying mean things about the wedding to everyone? remember this guy is a high paid professional photographer, he is not a stumbling drunk who just left his blue collar job on the loading docks. then they try to make it seem like he ruined the wedding by telling one bridesmaid that another bridesmaid once slept with the groom. after the three bridesmaids discuss it, we are dropped into a scene with a hysterical bride who just found out. matthew was nowhere near that scene and could not have told her, therefore one of the bridesmaids must have told her. so it was the bridesmaids that ruined the wedding not matthew. finally there is the photograph that he has apparently been caring in his wallet his whole life (yet it is not folded). earlier the plot point of the photo is forced down our throat, in a way that negates the final reveal. with the ghost of the past, he sees himself as a child take the photo, he (as an adult) knows it\\'s in his pocket, so he\\'d be embarrassed about it and would not call attention to the child saying \"forever.\" yet he does. why? oh yeah, to force the point down our throats. oh and when he\\'s taking pictures at the wedding. the nikon flash never pops up. such a believable photographer!',\n"," '\" what did you think of gangs of new york ? \" i asked my father who is also a big scorsese fan. \" i thought it was a load of \" $%^^$\"* $% \" he replied \" the actors looked like they were all going to burst out singing \" i could see where he was coming from although i did not disagree with him 100 %. gangs of new york had some really extreme opinions from its audience ,a point reflected in the comments thrown at it on this site.i did not think it was as bad as my dad made out but like i said i could seewhere he was coming from my major problem with the movie is the screenplay. the opening shot sees bill \" the butcher \" cutting kill priest vallon in front of his son who runs away swearing revenge for his dead father. from that point onwards we know that the story will end years later with a confrontation between the two protagonists so there\\'s no more dramatic twists for the story to take. actually this in itself is not too bad but what spoils the story is the way it\\'s held up with the character interaction between amsterdamn and jenny everdeane. scorsese does not do romantic interlude very well and this movie proves it. in amongst this diversion there\\'s something of a plot hole since bill takes the young amsterdamn under his wing even though he knows who he is. if you bumped off someones father in a street fight would you adopt their kids ? i did not think so this could have been an absolutely brilliant script and it is very good in places where we see how the gangs are structured , their ethnic mix and their political affiliations - some are protestant with members who were born in america , some are catholic with many members born in ireland , all are anglophobe and they all hate each other. we also see one of the most cynical episodes in american history where immigrants getting off ships at new york are immediately conscripted into the union army unless they pay 300 dollars which eventually leads to the draft riots. when the movie concentrates on these parts of the plot it\\'s a great film but becomes heavily bogged down by the character subplots if scorsese had directed this 20 years ago with a fraction of the budget he had here this could have been his masterwork but he seems to have overawed by riches. everything is just a bit too grandiose and operatic to be entirely convincing. charles dickens had visited the five points and is recorded as saying it was the worst place on earth. scorsese makes the streets a little too clean , a little too hollywood grunge , a little too glamorous in spite of everything. leonardo dicaprio is a very underrated actor held back by his startling good looks but he\\'s wrong as amsterdamn and was not right for the part which should have gone to an unknown. cameron diaz is totally unconvincing as jenny and scorsese could have easily given the part to a real life ny hooker while daniel day lewis gives a powerhouse performance as bill cutting , however the role is slightly overplayed especially compared to lewis\\'s other work indeed everyone involved in gangs of new york in whatever capacity has done far better in other movies and at the end of the day this is a very unsatisfying flawed picture which received more nominations than it did prizes at award ceremonies , and i am somewhat happy about that because this movie is not a crowning achievement for anyone , especially martin scorsese or daniel day lewis who are capable of better things seven out of ten',\n"," 'along with his turn in the super-sleazy \\'classic\\' the toolbox murders (1978), this is considered the ultimate bad cameron mitchell horror effort. it\\'s a little too slow-moving for my tastes, has zero likable characters in it and not much action until the very end, but mitchell\\'s dedicated central psycho performance as vengeance-minded whack-job vincent rinard is fun. not anthony perkins good, mind you, but definitely fun enough. as a spoof of the shallow conceit that is hollywood, it\\'s only so-so; as a horror movie it\\'s also only fair. and even as just a simple vintage exploitation picture, it\\'s just ok. i am a big fan of the unnecessary gratuitous dance sequence, so i was also thankful for the appearance of the gazzarri dancers, who just rule. five of them do a crazy hair-thrashin\\', floor-slidin\\', hip-shaking\\' go-go dance routine to \"do not cry, look for the rainbow\" by the t-bones. watching these ladies bounce around with huge smiles on their faces in their fringe-covered bikini top and parachute pants ensemble is a defining reason why i give this a slightly higher rating that usual. former movie make-up man vincent rinard (\"the best since lon chaney!\") goes after people at paragon studios. a flashback shows how max black (berry kroeger), a jealous and drunk studio executive, flung wine in vinnie\\'s face right when he was about to light a smoke. he\\'s engulfed in flames and dives into a pool, but not before scarring up one side of his face and losing an eyeball (not to mention his sanity). now employed by the \"world-famous\" movieland wax museum in buena park, california, vincent uses a special serum (described as a mixture of truth serum, nerve medicine and special \"vitamins and minerals\"... watch out centrum!) to paralyze victims. they disappear and the dense detectives on the case (headed by scott brady) act baffled as new \\'statues\\' are put on display in the museum. vince talks to himself (\"i am a terribly nice man!\"), chain-smokes, mumbles, hisses and describes how he gets \"excited\" by the sound of a woman\\'s scream. he also has to deal with a bunch of back-stabbing scumbags and self-absorbed witches, most of whom will deserve what\\'s coming to them. there is also nick (hollis morrison), a boozy, inept museum tour guide who sees a \\'statue\\' blink, but does not go to the cops. aside from max (a real grade-a jerk... who does not even die!) and the stupid cops, the other two lead roles are women and both are pretty atrocious. marie morgan (anne helm) is not your typical innocent heroine; this tramp has been engaged to no less that five different characters in this movie (!), including vince, max and two of the wax dummies/missing male stars (i guess she never had time to make a go at the one missing girl). for some reason, she also begs and pleads in her irritating baby-voice for vince to give her a \\'replica\\' of the head he\\'s designing of the newest missing actor (and fiancé number 5) tony deen (phillip baird). she does not know that vince has already jabbed a syringe in the back of his neck, but i love it when mitchell dryly agrees with her demands \"so you can completely retreat for reality.\" he also wants her to \\'pose\\' for him, which means she\\'s eventually held prisoner in a box. unfortunately, the box has a hole where her head sticks through so we have to continue getting aurally assaulted by her high-pitched whines. the other \"woman\" is theresa (victoria carroll), one of the aforementioned go-go girls. she\\'s first seen proving she is thoroughly rhythm-deficient by jiggling on stage in a lime-green fringe bikini. theresa is tolerable before she talks, but when you realize her grating presence combines the abrasiveness of lorraine bracco with the airhead mentality of the landers sisters, you wish vincent would inject her with the serum as soon as possible. unfortunately, we are first subjected to a scene of her making endless demands to the studio head honcho and running around in the museum trying to avoid mitchell. she and the rest of the characters are completely unsympathetic, but function as a way to poke fun at the hollywood system in general, i guess. and i am probably giving this movie more credit than it actually deserves. the pluses are few and far between, but include (other than mitchell and the dance routine), colorful, slightly stylized lighting and a bizarre ending that seems to suggest that rinard will be severely punished for his crimes by spending the rest of his life in his own personal hell... married to marie!... yikes, now that is scary. also in the cast are director john \"bud\" cardos (also the production manager) as a police sergeant, james forrest as a film director, virgil frye as a statue, rini martin and kent osborne as a bartender. many of the people who worked on this one (including executive producer and script-writer rex carlton) also worked on the al adamson movie blood of dracula\\'s castle and other atrocities. my score: 4 out of 10',\n"," \"lauren bacall was living through husband humprey bogarts illness & death when she did this film. rock hudson was near the top of his 1950's stardom. dorothy malone is in excellent form, and wins an oscar for support. robert stack is nominated &

a couple of the films early sequences. you can see why the cast is so good & actually production wise this film is very good. you can tell bacall is distracted during this film as while her acting is fine, she looks emotionally drained in some sequences. the sexual references in this film are so mild, that many of today's young viewers would not realize what they are. film does a good job telling

psychological journals. while cynthia gibb portrays a realistic karen, it is sad that so much has been edited... louise fletcher portrays her mother, and does an excellent job, with limited material

cable, usually educated. i sincerely feel that i could have written a better story, would not have edited out the truth, and allowed the actors to project the reality. richard carpenter, as director,

d\\'amato does not. d\\'amato\\'s most well known films are infamous for their high gross-out quotient. this, an early film by him, does not have the constant disgusting scenes that his more notorious \"anthropophagous\" and \"beyond the darkness\" did. ultimately, its an incoherent film that does not manage to involve the viewer in any way. without the sleaze factor either, it becomes very boring. as i said, others have enjoyed this film, but i just found it to be a perfect example of incredibly lazy writing. there are a few pluses for the film. ewa aulin (from \"candy\") is in it, and she looks pretty hot and is often naked. however, cult film icon klaus kinski is completely wasted in a subplot with no connection to the main film. he seems bored with the role and does not have the manic intensity he does at his finest. the music score is nice and there are some brief moments of unintentionally funny gore. still, this is a pretentious and pointless film that manages to be incredibly boring.

was 3 years old. i am 22 now and i still love the film that much, i am actually watching it right now. this review may contain spoilers! the land of faraway or mio min mio, as most people know it, is the story of a boy named bosse. his adoptive parents hate him and let him know it, the older kids bully him, and he only has two real friends: mrs. lundin a nice young woman who works at a local store and benke a boy from school. bosse greatest dream is to have a father that loves him like benke. one day mrs. lundin gives bosse a golden apple and asks him to mail a post card for her. the post card is to the king of the land of faraway and says something like \"the one you have been looking for is here; he will have an apple of gold in his hand\". then out of a bottle on the ground a giant head/spirit emerges and takes bosse away to the land of faraway. bosse finds out that he\\'s really mio the prince of the land of faraway! but there is a great evil man named kato who steals children and turns them into birds, legend says that only a prince can kill kato and save the children. so mio/bosse sets of with friend jum-jum/benke on an awesome adventure to defeat kato! the music in the film is so beautiful and haunting; you will be humming it for days. the acting by nick pickard as bosse/mio and christian bale as benke/jum-jum is outstanding. i particularly love the lighting in the film; firelight creates creepy shadows across the sets and really sets the mood for the darker scenes. the copy i have is old so the sound is really bad and since the movie was made in the late 1980s

\"smokey and the bandit\" movies. this film would have merited a rating a ten from me, but i gave it a seven because of the casting choice of brad garrett and the film\\'s failure to show us the

stupid. some applause should be given to the \"prelude\" however. in this episode, a lot of focus is given on how the murderer tries to secure his alibi and hide the evidence etc. i really liked that.

a good film and an extraordinary story (since it is a real story that makes it much more extraordinary). grandiloquent, self-kind, and everything but neutral (no matter what amenábar or bardem have

'the beach' is not just a movie, its an experience. :never refuse an invitation, never resist the unfamiliar. just keep your mind open and suck in the experience....\",\n"," \"i am not going to lie. despite looking interesting, i watched the notorious bettie page because i had heard (and it was fairly obvious just by looking at a synopsis or anything about the film), that gretchen mol got naked in it. i have never been a fan of mol, but i cannot resist seeing an attractive woman taking off her clothes. yes, that may be perverted, but its a theme and ideal central to the very core of the movie, and helps to make the film a lot stronger than it probably should be. the film chronicles bettie page's (mol) life from her physical and sexually abused days as a kid in high school in the south, and onto her new life in new york. she wants to be an actress, but she has to pay bills too. after taking a few seemingly innocent shots on a local beach, page slowly becomes a modeling sensation, and quickly jumps from suggestive photos to sexually provocative pin-up photographs. i feel the briefness of the film (just over ninety minutes) is both a curse and blessing for it. on one hand, the film never overstays its welcome. you get to know page within a few short minutes, and then it gets right into her modeling career and does not look back. but it curses the film as well, because we never really get a chance to grasp everything that is going on. she just kind of jumps around between modeling shoots and the controversies that they create before jumping right into the major senate investigation that takes up much of the final act of the film. you just sit there, and attempt to absorb it all, and more just comes right at you. it feels like the filmmakers wanted to summarize too much material in too short a film. it begs for longer sequences, and begs more for even longer explanations. it does not feel rushed; it just does not feel all there. another bit of a fumble, although a bit more of a curiosity, is the use of colour throughout the film. the majority is in black and white, but frequently, splashes and sequences of colour do emerge. but while this may have been done as a symbolic gesture early on, it becomes a bit of a distraction as it continually pops up later on before cutting back to black and white. it gets confusing, and becomes more of a tedious interference than anything else as the film goes on. while it may fumble a bit with the actions, the film stays dead-on with its themes. page, who i know little to nothing about, is played off innocently, and her world is exactly the same. save for a few shady characters during her teenage years, everyone she encounters is an innocent, and everything she does has an innocence to it. i never thought i would look at full frontal nudity as being something that was anything other than vulgar and depraved, but here, it truly is something to marvel at. all at once, it is beautiful and innocent. even the most sexually perverted moments in the film (albeit tame compared to today's standards) have an innocent and angelic feeling to them. there is just something about the way mol's nude body is portrayed that it just strikes at such a different chord than nude bodies in other films. it just feels so natural and so wondrous, that if there were any reason to watch the film, it would be to see the spectacular depictions of mol's body as she plays bettie page. the other reason is mol herself. as page, she exemplifies that 1950's southern belle everyone knows (or can at least imagine). despite her profession, she is still a normal person, and still looks at herself as being religious. mol plays her exactly to the right amount of squeaky-cleanliness needed to make this character feel authentically from the 1950's. she plays her with such matter-of-factness that you would be hard-set not to think that mol was actually bettie page herself. unfortunately, the supporting cast have very little moments to shine, and are totally overshadowed by mol's wonderful performance. none of them do anything particularly pleasing, and none of them really have that same strength in their role as mol does. this is not really the fault of the actors, but more of the fact that they do not have much to work with. many of them are totally recognizable, such as oscar-nominee david strathairn (in a role a little too close to one of his better performances), sarah paulson (recent golden globe nominee for studio 60 on the sunset strip), and character actor lili taylor, but you would be hard set to really place their performance in being anything other than okay. none of these characters are really developed, and they really just stand as character cut-outs who mol runs loops around as she picks up steam in her brilliant performance. really, this film is worthwhile for its portrayal of nudity, and for gretchen mol's excellent performance of bettie page. everything else is a bit too muddled and awkward than it should be. had more work been done to develop supporting characters and not just blast right through the story, this film would have been a much better biographical film. as it stands, it is just a vehicle for mol to really rise into the stratosphere of popularity as an actress. 7/10.\",\n"," 'the movie was not a waste except for some

stay up late on sunday evenings to watch it. bonanza is still infinitely re watchable in re runs. the series chronicles the adventures of the cartwright family, who live on a ranch near virginia city, nevada around the civil war era. their ranch (called the ponderosa) is run and defended by the widowed father, ben, and his unmarried three sons, adam, hoss, and little joe. these three brothers have different mothers, all of whom have passed away years earlier. the cartwrights are a hard working, prosperous, and honourable family, highly respected in those parts. the ponderosa is large so reaching its extremities requires a lot of horseback riding. also, trips away are often necessary in order to buy or sell cattle and so forth. needless to say, few of these excursions pass uneventfully. although hospitable, much of the cartwrights' energy must be spent defending their ranch from interlopers, or protecting themselves from townsfolk jealous of their prosperity and stellar reputation. the cartwrights do a fair bit of firing their guns up in the air and such, but only shoot to kill when deemed absolutely necessary. they are involved in various town affairs, even the political life of the nevada territory. one of the main assets of the series is the underlying warmth that is always present (despite occasional disagreements) between ben and his three sons, and (despite frequent disagreements) between the three brothers. now, one brother might beat up another every now and then, but generally has a good reason for it at the time and his anger never lasts long! the characters are all very well drawn. ben is portrayed as a successful and noble man of great integrity. the oldest son, adam, the most rational and suave of the brothers, left midway through the series. the middle brother, hoss, is a gentle giant of a teddy bear, who has an insatiable appetite for food and is a little shy around the ladies. the youngest, little joe, is a hot headed, handsome charmer who, by contrast, has quite a way with women. this trio of brothers enjoy various romances but their love interests are typically killed off by the end of the episode or else marriage proves impossible, for whatever reason. the actors are all stellar in their roles, including pernell roberts (adam), dan blocker (hoss), michael landon (little joe), and of course lorne greene as the principled family patriarch, ben. i also love the ranch cook, hop sing, played by victor sen yung. this is a wonderful action packed western with great values. the cartwrights are always the noble

the same river as each other. the mysterious owner, \\'blackie\\' (robert englund) gives them a second chance to correct all the blunders they have made in life and as a result of their success, lets them stay on as the new cook and waitress at the café. the café serves as both a central location for the action and as a plot catalyst, primarily by exerting its influence upon each episode\\'s protagonists, or antagonists, to bring them into contact with the regulars. aside from transporting itself from place to place in its entirety, once settled, it can also create portals between itself and various locations, which are traversed (often unexpectedly on the whim of the café) by crossing the threshold of one of the café\\'s many doorways. these portals are not restricted to the earth, the café can also travel to outer space and, apparently, even heaven, which hints at a supernatural origin. the café also has the ability to make both idle and heartfelt wishes come true, which of course are not always what the recipient actually wants or needs, and the café seems to take a perverse delight in \"misinterpreting\" such wishes. frank and fay often take advantage of this ability by wishing themselves from place to place, when this occurs, or when the café otherwise deems it important, those remaining in the dining room can watch the exploits of their companions on the (sometimes interactive) television set mounted in the far wall. of the cast, robert englund (better known to the public as \\'freddy kruger\\') was the stand out. blackie was a creepy, sarcastic

\"firstly, rear window by alfred hitchcock is one of my favorite movies, however it is important not to compare this to that classic. remakes are often less impressive than the originals because you

fairly enjoyable film to watch. my one major complaint for this one is that it wrapped up too quickly. by the time we have this guy getting accused of killing people, he's shoving the mother's head into the door and coming to the main character's house and slamming people's heads in with a bat. i think the film could really have been improved by letting the suspicions and tensions run a little

a way which makes it obvious from the very beginning how they will react to any situation. the next problem is that the plot is as boring and predictable as the actors. unless you are somewhat

and gentlemen, allow us to introduce to you. the toltecs! this ancient latin american tribe, even preceding the aztecs, supposedly had the most malevolent and bloodthirsty sorcerers, yet they get their asses whooped by a couple of college floozies and a one-hundred-and-seven-year old lawman with a whip! but before you get to see this, however, you have to struggle through more than 40 minutes of sheer boredom, infantile pranks and sleazy sequences that do not contain any actual sleaze. in case i have not made myself entirely clear yet: \"the dark power\" is an indescribably cheesy and inept piece of 80\\'s horror crap that still manages to be amusing because of its sheer and somewhat charming stupidity factor. writer/director phil smoot\\'s intentions were obviously admirable, but he as well as the rest of the cast & crew lacked the talent and financial means to deliver something even half-decent. smoot carefully watched \"the evil dead\" and other similar demonic-themed movies, and somehow must have thought he could pull this off as well. the movie opens with an old indian guy dying in his isolated countryside house; barely speaking out his last word above a whisper toltecs. his grandson promptly rents out house to a bunch of college chicks, including a typically 80\\'s aerobics babe, a cute black girl and a racist redneck gal. soon they will discover why exactly the old indian lived like a hermit, as he was actually the guardian of an ancient toltec burial ground. toltec sorcerers buried themselves alive, only to emerge again thousands of years later and feed on the flesh of the living. and, honestly, is there any better tasting flesh than that of bimbos? as hinted at before already, the first half of \"the dark power\" is terribly lame and sleep-inducing. the clichéd pranks, the retarded dialogs and the ridiculously overlong footage of lash larue swinging around his whip seem to go on forever. then, the movie loses its last smidgen of credibility when the toltec sorcerers emerge from the ground. instead of menacing, they look like drugged out hard rock stars with imbecile masks and drunken gestures. exactly one gory moment is worth mentioning, when a guy\\'s lips are stretched out over his entire skull, but overall even the carnage aspect of this movie is disappointing. the only remotely worthwhile moments are utterly senseless, like when a 9-year-old kid (named cletus!) goes joyriding with his uncle\\'s truck or when the vulgar naked chick sips beer in the bathtub after working out. seriously, unless you get turned on by the sight of a 1940\\'s western veteran swinging around his whip at nothing, i\\'d advise to skip this film.',\n"," 'deeply disturbing, intelligently made and without a screaming teen in sight, \\'candyman\\' is one of the stand-out horror movies of the decade. to just list all the elements that make this one of the classiest genre efforts of recent years would probably take up most of the thousand words i am allowed here. suffice to say, it has a genuinely uncomfortable premise, uncompromising execution and a bone jarringly lonely score by philip glass. tony todd is exceptional as the hollow-voiced titular creature; a lost soul brought to life by the whispers of myth. at once heartbreaking and terrifying this could be the definitive latter day horror movie monster- if it was not just that little bit too close to hellraiser\\'s pinhead. but, when you have a winning combination of elegance and disgust in a verbose, cultured villain, why alter it too much? virginia madsen convinces totally as helen; and you can almost see all the cast acting their little socks off so as not to let the side down. so good, in fact, that i am struggling to find one bad thing to say about it. i read here, that in the eyes of one viewer, it \"dwells on the nastier things in life\" and was not a \"nice film\". i can think of no greater compliment for a truly adult horror movie. no dear, you will not find happy teens in pastel t-shirts having slumber parties and discussing trendy scary movies, while some rap star tries to sell records on the soundtrack. this is a grown up film for grown up people. there is a reason horror films are for adults, and that reason is \\'candyman\\'.',\n"," 'my brother and i have been watching and re-watching twilight zones since they first an live back in the early

who makes \\'the big wish\\' is quite memorable... \"please, please...\". my brother and i would talk about when we would potentially need to make the big wish. and then it happened... my brother jeff, who lives in los angeles, had been in new york during the alcs series. being both ardent red sox fans for over 20 years at that point, we were really bummed by the way the series was going. the night before he was leaving to go back to la was almost the last straw. the sox lost to go down 3-1. jeff, who had tickets to the game the next day stated forlornly \"i am going home to a funeral\".

particular, this episode had changed the course of history. at least from our distorted perspective.',\n"," 'this is a disturbing, bittersweet romantic comedy about two people who\\'s 15 year marriage is unraveling. actually, it is more of a romantic tragedy than a comedy. ben and katie jordan (bruce willis and michelle pfeiffer) are two mismatched people in the marriage that never should have been. he is spontaneous, romantic and impulsive, with low frustration tolerance and an explosive hair trigger temper. she is pragmatic, a compulsive perfectionist with unrealistic expectations, and a high need for control. she takes everything personally and never forgives or forgets a slight. they both blame each other for their disappointments. the pattern is clear. he does not meet her standards so she snipes, he explodes and then she accuses him of not listening. she then throws up every mistake he\\'s ever made and every fault he\\'s ever had. this goes on ad nauseam as their romantic obsession with one another continues to get the best of any sense they might have to call it quits. like moths to a flame, they keep returning for another scorching. this film is thought provoking in that it portrays marital difficulties that are all too familiar in our society. the problem is that it tries to give every problem known to man (with the exception of wife beating) to this couple and relies on the single strand of a long forgotten romance to be the only chance of keeping them together. in watching the behind the scenes featurette on this film, rob reiner and writers alan zweibel and jessie nelson discuss how the story evolved. as it turns out, it was a montage of all their own marital problems. so the film was, in essence cathartic dumping ground for the writers and director. as filmmaking, it was terrific. rob reiner weaves the story together expertly, creating a stark contrast between the joy of the romance and the reality of the relationship. the film was punctuated by numerous funny and sweet moments that make the viewer smile and glow with delight. michelle pfeiffer gives a splendid performance of a very emotionally complex and neurotic character. it took a lot of courage for her to take this part because she was playing the least likeable character in the film, something of a departure for her. bruce willis was as good as one could have expected considering the fact that nobody was blowing anything up. actually, he was quite good as the impulsive, childlike romantic, but when it came to the arguments and the serious displays of resentment, he played the scenes too harshly, almost commando style. reiner does good camera work and puts together some good rapid fire scenes that have impact and give great insight into the relationship. he also took the film on location in venice to add a little romantic interlude, and somehow got eric clapton to write a great theme song. the problem is the story. reiner stated in the featurette that he intended this to be a realistic bittersweet look at the real problems relationships face. but he tried to do too much and made this film a grossly exaggerated caricature of a relationship in crisis. it is really \"the war of the roses\" lite only it takes itself too seriously. no one i know who saw this could believe that this couple could possibly have stayed married for 15 weeks, no less 15 years. the result is a noxious marathon of petty arguments that get under the viewers\\' skin after a while. it is about as entertaining as watching your best friends have a niggling argument in a public restaurant. the whole thing leaves you very uncomfortable and you do not go home feeling like you have had a nice evening. so, while it succeeds as filmmaking, it fails as a film. i gave this film a 6/10. there were so many good elements to it that i can not see trashing it. but the story is one that requires a level of emotional endurance that few viewers will be willing or able to invest to get any enjoyment out of it.',\n"," 'the city couple andy and elisabeth farmer, played by chevy chase and madolyn smith, leave the city life to move out to the country. he

closest thing i had ever seen to pornography at the young age of 7 or 8. luckily i had stupid babysitters and party-going parents on the weekends. most of my memory of this movie was the completely erratic sexual behavior of these two guys. breaking into houses to sniff underwear, feeding on a stranger's breast milk on a public bus, and fornicating in a cab at the request of one of their female

watching camp. some of the dialogue is awkward, and the story lines do not always wrap up quite neatly, or at least not ideally. but that's how life is, especially during the often awkward adolescent years, and the emotional realism is touching. though it loses momentum at times, the movie never loses my interest because of it's strong characters, great musical numbers, and its fanciful--though a bit unrealistic--depiction of this teen-drama-summer camp world that i barely knew existed. and it's a particular world that most people have never experienced, but anybody who's ever felt awkward as a teenager can relate to this movie. though never an aspiring actor or singer, i certainly related, and i enjoyed every minute of it. i am not quite sure if camp fits neatly into the musical genre, and i do not care. i do know that i could not even watch the first 10 minutes of the new hairspray musical with john travolta. it repulsed me. but i love camp, (as i do dancer in the dark) which in my non-musical-expert opinion, has too much music-less dialogue, thankfully, to be considered a true musical. this favorable review of camp is from someone who generally hates musicals.\",\n"," \"i think

led by the fates. although i am not normally a fan of the sleepy-eyed and laconic mitchum, i thought his signature traits were used to excellent effect here, and well explained by the trauma that eats him apart so much inside that he is unwilling to stand up for himself. teresa wright is stunning as mitchum's foster-sister-turned-object-of-lust-turned-true-love-tuned-would-be-executioner-turned-true love again. what a woman! one thing that differentiates this 1947 film in my book as a noir not a western is that the two main women are anything but passive -- and even more so -- anything but madonnas or whores. they are unafraid to fire guns or stand up to militias. but they will fulfill what is in their hearts even when it means societal disapproval or death. although the plot is full of holes, the storytelling is excellent enough to overcome it. great pacing too -- a really fun ride.\",\n"," \"i

come close to, if not win, the audience favorite award! what was most surprising was the fact the the movie appears to start off as a satire and then slowly weaves into a genuine commentary on the negative and sometimes violent reactions of the very group it started to satirize. there is not any mean spirited humor at the expense of one group, just a slow realization that we would all be better off if we just went back to the gentle innocence that we all started off with.\",\n"," 'though not completely awful, this film disappoints. though independent directors bemoan the studio system and how it stifles creativity, there is at least one thing that the studios have done fairly consistently: they have been able to remind directors that good acting is highly desirable. too many indie directors take a concept and some creative ideas and then simply relegate the acting to the lowest priority possible. that\\'s one of the problems with \"splinter\"... budget-level acting. i do not consider sizemore to be an outstanding actor, but he truly embarrasses virtually every other actor in this film, especially atis, who simply appears amateurish and uncertain in every scene. so, sorry... can not recommend this one at all. crummy acting condemns a movie, regardless of the concept, story, and other production values.',\n"," 'this film is shockingly underrated on imdb. like so

as voice over or off screen, with just a little hint here and there, until it became painfully obvious. this is the kind of dubbing that grates on the nerves, with nothing even remotely funny about it. i hate dubbing, but at least, however misplaced, martial arts films badly dubbed tend to have a sense of humour about it. what i wanted was a film about a hacker doing actual hacking and stuff like that. maybe like a reverse side of the table of the movie hackers (being about the person trying to keep them out instead about the people trying to get in). what i got was some poorly written, nonsensical at times murder mystery with a ton of bad chase sequences, a supposedly inept hacker who was neutered without his little ego, and a director who obviously did not know how to handle a camera. i just wanted to reach in there, grab the camera from the guy, and shoot the dang thing myself. the editing was not much better. the acting? well, i guess if the lead guy did not have such a bad script to work from, he'd be at least watchable. the main bad guy was ok, too, but pretty much everyone else was a joke. dubbing did not help, but the acting was pretty bad even taking that into consideration. before i get into more bad, let's perk up to a few good things. well, one or two. despite the rudimentary graphics, i rather enjoyed the cyberworld stuff, what little there was of it, and would have much rather watched a movie mostly about, in, and around that than the tepid surroundings outside in the 'real world'. the falsifying thumbprint thing seemed kind of cool, but ended up being rather useless in the scheme of things. the heart gadget, which reminded me of guillermo del toro's cronos, was interesting, though as a plot device ripped directly from the pages of escape from new york, it was horribly conceived in the long run. there's one point where the bad guy is unconscious and our hero is right there. why did not he try the bad guy's thumb print then (since the heart device was thumb activated)? nonetheless, some interesting gadgets and cyber stuff, if only they could have been utilized better. now, who here dares compare this movie to blade runner? both films take place sometime in the future and there's some kind of off kilter type of romance in it, sort of, in both films. there's the investigation of a murder, but i have seen many a film with a murder at its center that are nothing like either blade runner or webmaster. identity, for instance. that's about where the similarities end. period. there is no comparison, just as there would not be between blade runner and hackers. ridley scott is a brilliant director with a great mind for art direction and knows some fundamentals of film-making, like where to put the camera. webmaster is cheap, and not just because of the budget. it's cheap because of bad writing, and because it more often than not takes the easy way out (like writing in a character who barely appeared in the first place to save the girl in the end to get her to point b by herself without the hero, so that he could do his thing. very convenient. or, the attempted sympathy factor for a character we have no reason to care for. or, inane things like the car set up to stall them just enough for someone to get away.). it tries to be hip, it tries to be exploitive, it even tries a twist ending that's not the least bit surprising,

a great horror movie.',\n"," \"if you are the sort of person who can get a kick out of a very bad movie, then i highly recommend this one. if you are not, stay away. this is an astonishingly cheap-looking movie, and at times you may find yourself wondering if it is not just a prank someone is pulling on you. the most positive comment i can make about it is that the people responsible seemed to realize that it was super-low-budget nonsense, so there is at least a sense of fun here. but this is as amateurish as it gets. their idea of giant killer mushrooms are simply guys covered with beige colored sheets with what looks like trash can covers on their heads. it's obviously not meant to be taken seriously (to say the least), but even with that disclaimer you'll find yourself shaking your head at the awesome cheesiness of it all. or laughing out loud frequently, as i did.\",\n"," 'one of the worst movies i have ever rented. sorry it had one of my favorite actors on it

ask her daughters. i do not think so.',\n"," \"i was actually excited to see this film especially since i loved the original. what can i say about this movie except horrible. i feel bad because there are people out there who wait tables work in restaurant cleaning just to get an acting gig. they go through schooling and acting classes. yet they manage to get the worst actors of all time. they all sounded as if they were reading the script. the dialog was horrible. the script was horrible which made it even more difficult for the actors to make it seem real so it's not 100% their fault. the ending was completely predictable and obvious as opposed the the classic what the hell ending of the original that still makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand. the killings were basic repeats of the original primarily the first killing. the only reason i would give it a 1 is because of the murder scene in the woods (you know what i am talking about) and the broom stick scene. the annoying fat guy was just horrible, i felt no sympathy for him whatsoever since he was a pain in the @$$ to others as well not mention the worst actor of them all. if you are a fan of the series, give it a look because everyone has their own opinion but do not say i did not warn you.\",\n"," 'the man with the golden arm was one of the first films to have as its main topic (and, in some respects, the message) the tragedy of heroin addiction. it\\'s nowhere near a great film, but its importance lies in otto preminger\\'s dedication to making it feel real and on the edge of melodrama and naturalism. what i liked is that it\\'s not so much an expose of junkies (if you want the best expose of that read naked lunch, if you can get through it anyway, besides the point), but the nature of the urban environment frankie machine lives. he expects after he gets out of prison for dealing to go on the straight and narrow, to become a drummer in a band and make it legit as a musician. but he has his \"crippled\" wife zosch, who can not work and needs money and often complains, and then there\\'s the old neighborhood- he can not escape seeing louie (darren mcgavin), who is still doing back-room card games and, yes, pushing dope. like mean streets, it\\'s hard to escape the minutia unless you leave. but then again, it\\'s hard for frankie machine not to try and operate naturally in this urban quarter. it\\'s just that he can not escape the temptation of junk (when he\\'s booked on a phony theft charge with his friend, he sees a junkie freaking out, and it puts back the fear of going back on into his clean self). and personifying frankie is sinatra, and i can not see anyone else who could have played him, even original choice brando. he fits into the neighborhood, and seems like the kind of guy who should be a step ahead of the game. but there\\'s also a vulnerability to sinatra that he pulls out wonderfully, and by the time we see him going \\'cold turkey\\' in molly\\'s apartment, it\\'s believable even if it\\'s not the kind of thing those from \\'my\\' generation would think of heroin (i.e. trainspotting and certainly requiem for a dream). if for nothing else, you want to watch the movie to see what happens to sinatra as this character. the flaws, however, come in some of the other performances, though it\\'s a little tricky. eleanor parker seems to be overacting for a good portion of the movie, fooling frankie that she\\'s really crippled when in reality she can walk and is fooling him for one reason or another. but then it becomes clearer as it goes along- she\\'s supposed to be nuts, and nuts with jealousy, and on that level it starts to get better. meanwhile, kim novak is good, though not vertigo-worthy, as the possible girl in the side but more like the voice of reason in the story. then there\\'s a detective bendar, who might be one of the most one-note characters/performances, ever. and also sparrow, frankie\\'s nerdy friend, and the characters of louie and schiefka, and they are all played as one might expect them to (actually, mcgavin is better than ok). as far as casting other talent around sinatra, preminger does not do all that great. and, frankly, some scenes kind of fall flat. but there\\'s a lot of fascination in the man with the golden arm, and not just as some dated piece of sociological interest. it works as compelling drama, and as a message piece conveyed without being preachy or campy. it\\'s a genuine article, just not exceptional.',\n"," \"1st watched 10/10/2009 - 8 out of 10 (dir - billy wilder): spectacular rendering of lindbergh's famous flight by james stewart as lindbergh and director billy wilder. there is not really a whole lot of background built into this story but that's ok because wilder makes the event really remarkable as it comes directly from lindbergh's perspective since he used his book as the basis of the movie. this early movie about flying has to be one of the best about the act itself as well. stewart talking and thinking to himself during the flight gives you so much insight into what lindbergh went thru in this 33 hour solo flight across the atlantic. and he did the whole flight without sleeping the night before -- which is amazing! there is a little backstory about how he purchased the plane and got the financing, and some flashbacks about his life during the flight but the movie is mostly about the flight. the story is also beautifully made and photographed and is a joy to watch despite it's age. i appreciate the fact that they did not throw in a lot of fluff and just let the story tell itself. well done throughout. this is a classic movie that should be viewed by all.\",\n"," 'if you liked freaks and geeks this is a must-see. judd apatow

(though i did enjoy the 1980 version). so i begin watching it and am immediately struck by substantial differences between the novel and this movie version. that's okay with me-- i am not one of those novel nazis who say that you can not change a thing when translating a work from one medium to another. they introduce a character, who is a friend of george's. he seems to serve as something of a springboard, so that we can see what george is thinking. no problem so far. unfortunately, it quickly becomes clear that the screenwriter did not understand the novel at all. haber's intentions are good-- the world is horrible and he wants to use george to change it for the better. and, yes, he does change it a bit to improve his position in life. the screenplay does not seem to correctly emphasize that haber is purposefully having george dream certain dreams to change reality for the better. and that the changing of reality is not to be taken lightly-- there are unintended consequences, because everything is connected. so, basically, do not see it. ever. i give it a rating of 2 only to congratulate the filmmakers for making a good choice of a novel to do-- just that

amusing and interesting information about the making of the first film, and, to a lesser extent, the sequels made in later years. the show is hosted by mark kermode (also of \"on the edge of blade runner\" fame), who narrates the whole show, and is on hand to give little quips about the production of the films. the documentary primarily deals with the 1979 original masterpiece, and ridley scott, dan o\\'bannon, sigourney weaver and other participants are on hand to talk about their experiences making the film. of course, where the real meat is (and is something that was not included on the cut version of the doc on the alien quadrilogy dvd set) concerns the making of aliens, alien 3 and alien: resurrection. granted, all of the participants in the aliens interviews have nothing but glowing praise for the film, but when you get down to the later entries, people have some surprisingly interesting things to say, including h.r. giger, who compares the alien suit design in alien 3 to a piece of excrement, and lance henriksen talking about how the third film destroyed all the work that was put into the first two entries, it sheds a whole new perspective on what it was like for the cast and crew to experience these films. it is understandable that fox would want to cut these offending bits (seeing as how they cut an hour of candid footage of david fincher out of the alien 3 special edition documentaries), so they recut the film and had it focus on the first movie instead. i do not believe this was a wise move, and i think that if the studio heads have a chance, they should release this documentary in it\\'s original form for everyone to see. bottom line: i am giving this a 9 out of 10, because, as it is, the documentaries featured on the alien quadrilogy set actually have better in-depth coverage of the same material posted here, but not everything. if you can find it, the documentary airs on television sometimes. watch it if you get the chance.',\n","

mention the movie\\'s name so i was expecting something so offensively anachronistic that my jaw was going to drop in disbelief. it did drop in disbelief , i found myself not being able to believe

to a kidnapping/extortion plot. through it all and amidst all that emotional upheaval and soul-searching, what in heaven\\'s name will debbie do? well, i cannot give it away completely but do not expect any real epiphany here. let\\'s face it. naughty stewardesses is just what it wants to be(at least two-thirds through): a soft core porn film with lots of topless women and a funny in that kitchy 70\\'s way film. there is no grand art here. the movie was designed to make money and exploit a growing trend at the time to put nymphomaniacal stewardesses in films so that the audience could live out vicariously their voyeuristic tastes. by todays standards, the film is pretty tame. what this film does do wrong is try to be some kind of statement film at the end. c\\'mon, anyone here believing that little diatribe by debbie while on the beach contemplating life. she would spend more time picking out which halter top she will wear that day then do that. and what about the ridiculous plot to steal 50 grand? it did not make sense to me so how on earth did these characters \"dig\" it? anyone buying cal as a member of the plo(something like that) or even as a director for hardcore pornography? he would be luck to get work at seven eleven! this is, as another reviewer noted, more of a sam sherman piece then and al adamson piece. you can tell when al is in complete charge. there is virtually no budget and the film does not look nearly as polished as this. adamson does a decent job directing this time and i have to give sherman credit to a degree. while this film is bad just for what it was meant to be, it has a certain style to it. i liked the opening credits with the animation and photographs. i even liked the music of sparrow. \"silver heels\" was a somewhat catchy tune. the movie does not look cheap really at all. compare that to any of al\\'s horror films. as for the cast, yes, bob livingston is a bit old for the lead, but some examination went into his character and the obvious thread that young women are attracted to men with money was explored as well. i had major problems with robert smedley who was just plain awful in his role. the girls have all got great sets, so what else was required of them huh? naughty stewardesses is relatively harmless exploitation film from the 70\\'s and will serve as a living time capsule for certain

separate derek from the guy who belts out hits on vh-1. i generally would not watch a horror movie. i have come to expect them to focus on sensationalistic gore rather than dialogue and plot. what pleased me most about this film was that there really was a viable plot being moved along. the gore is not so much as to become the focus of the film and does not have a disturbingly realistic quality of films with higher technical effects budgets. so, gore fans might be disappointed, but story fans will not. unlike an action film like u-571 where the dialogue takes a back seat to the bombast, we get a chance to know \"the good guys\" and actually care what happens to them. a few scenes are left unexplained (like derek\\'s hallucinations) but you get the feeling certain aspects were as they were to lay the foundation for a sequel. unfortunately, with the lack of interest shown by hollywood in this film, that sequel will never happen. these few instances are forgiveable knowing that

on a scale of value that stands far above any individual's presumption to criticize. the timing of world at war's production in 1974, amounting to some three decades after the events of the war, permits an accurate relating of events in a manner uncoloured by residual propaganda and slant. the passage of thirty years allows the telling to be backed up by an impressive and fascinating panoply of the very individuals involved, ranging from some of the highest military and political figures down to the field soldiers, civilians, and such survivors of the death camps as have remained to bear witness to the unimaginable inhumanities of which civilized humans are capable. most approaching or well into their senior years, the interviewed subjects have had enough time to reflect on their experiences and in most instances have had enough time for whatever propaganda and fervor may have affected them in the past to have receded away, leaving only the memories of what they saw and what they did. the information that these survivors give, strikingly reinforced by the postures and expressions they display while telling their part, give their stories all the more impact. such names as ira eaker, adolph galland, louis mountbatten, albert speer, gertrude junge (hitler's personal secretary)... the list is far too long to relate. today, within the lifetime of the survivors of this enormous lesson in the hideous price of political ambition, are young people who chant the same sort of militaristic and nationalistic war promotion as led to ww2. the dvd series we discuss here ought to comprise the core of a mandatory history subject in schools, that the lessons bought at such a horrible cost in those days should not have been wasted but should be taken to heart by those who did not see firsthand the terrible price. i am almost done watching the 11 disk set, having seen most of the series when a local tv channel aired it more than 10 years ago. it has lost none of its

explored well enough to either strike fear into the viewer or to deter would be smugglers. little or no tension is built up, too much time is spent early on showing in a rather dull way, how it spreads from fox to cat to fox to dog to human and so on, that soon the viewer will be asking what all the fuss is about. i can also say that i have never seen animal lovers portrayed in such a bad light, every single one in the mad death, is played as crazy or with murderous intentions, they have no interest in stopping the spread of the virus, even the merest of actions like keeping your dog indoors is treated with apathy and anger, all in all not very believable. the acting is stilted beyond belief, with numerous silences and laboured pauses, actors staring into space and these are not the ones that are infected. there\\'s also a love triangle going on that is dull in the extreme. the restrictions set in place by police and dept of agriculture are also quite laughable in their laxness, if such an outbreak occurred in reality, the uk would be absolutely doomed. now i realize some elements of plot have to be there to further the story, but here it is pushed to ridiculous extremes. so has the mad death got anything going for it? well, there are a few interesting set pieces, a rabid fox locked in a garage, a rabid alsatian loose in a shopping mall, spring to mind, but even these are lazily handled. in a time when viruses are a real threat to humanity, its hard to get scared by a poodle and a labrador running wild in a forest. if the filmmakers were out to scare the audience they failed miserably, if they were out to educate the public as to the risks, they also failed as its a little too preachy',\n"," 'great satire of the modern greek -tsifteteli, souvlaki,

unnecessary to the plot. the ending is very anti-climatic and leaves many unanswered questions to a story line that was not explained well to begin with. in my opinion, a waste of time.',\n"," 'i saw

a plot with kenny going to hell, and finding saddam hussein and satan in love. saddam is a hornball. and satan regrets the whole relationship. crudity: definitely for adults only. it probably has the most swear words than any other movie this year. it has cartoon nudity. it has breasts and wriggling penises. all cartoon, of course. it has violence galore by the end. do not take your kids to see this, or be prepared to feel uncomfortable. all theaters must enforce the carding laws for this one. however, if none of this will offend you to the point of hatred, do not see this. it also has racism, sexism, and offends every group out there from the gays to the mpaa to the parents. as a whole: the funniest movie so far of 1999. i laughed so hard. i found it only mildly offensive personally, but then i also love the movie \"pink flamingos.\" i cannot recommend this movie to everyone. i can recommend it to those who are not offended easily. this does not include the people who

more of an action comedy-adventure with a fairly weak sf premise. for the first half hour of the movie i thought i was going to love it. once again you find yourself in awe of miyazaki's attention to detail, and his ability to conjure up an imaginary world in meticulous, beautiful perfection. the animation, though still not in the league of the later ghibli films, is a little better than in nausicaa. i mentioned in my review of nausicaa that one character is drawn in a more 'lupinesque' anime style. here there are a whole bunch of them: the pirates. they provide the comic element in the film, though quite why it needs a comic element i am not sure. there was nothing funny about nausicaa, and i think it was better off for it. still. having said that, dola, the pirate leader, is easily the most memorable character in the film (even if she's basically a female long john silver. do not be surprised if you are reminded of 'treasure planet' at times) and is well voiced by cloris leachman in the american dub. the english voice cast acquit themselves well for the most part, actually. however something started going pear-shaped for me about this movie by about the halfway mark. i think the best way that i could describe it is that the characters get swallowed up by the vast scope of the story. i'll come back to that later. there is so much to admire about laputa, and so many people obviously love it, that i almost feel mean for only giving it 8 out of 10, but for me the operative word here is 'admire'. it was more impressive than personally affecting, and at over two hours it just started to drag. the crucial thing for me was this: i really found that i did not care much about any of the characters. disney would have taken the care to develop the characters, make you really fall for them, rather than leave them as relatively two-dimensional pieces to be moved around while you gawked at the amazing vistas in the movie. even that would have been tolerable if there was some hard sf in the story to make up for it, but it was basically a lot of gobledegook about princesses and magic crystals. that's where laputa falls down as far as i am concerned, and that's what holds it back from being a potential 10 out of 10 movie. having said that, it must be admitted that miyazaki was leagues ahead of disney in general in 1986, when you consider that their movie of the same year was the pretty dire 'great mouse detective'. laputa is a good film in some ways an amazing film, and you should definitely see it, but i do feel it's over-rated. i definitely prefer the earlier 'nausicaa of the valley of the wind'. btw, if you manage to watch them in chronological order, watch for the fox-squirrel from nausicaa popping up briefly in laputa.\",\n"," 'joan crawford returned to mgm for torch song after a decade of other films at other studios, in a role that paints her character as tough-as-nails--in fact, so tough that you expect her to take out a gun at any moment and shoot anyone who disagrees with her bossy persona. not only is she tough, but the script is trite from beginning to end and the whole film is garishly lit in bright technicolor to show off joan\\'s wardrobe and a neat pair of legs. it all seems like a warm-up for johnny guitar in lush settings rather than a saloon. that she can not sing is obvious because it\\'s immediately apparent that a professional singer is doing the songs (india adams). and despite her early days as a hoofer doing the charleston and other dances during her flaming youth, it\\'s also easy to see that dancing is not her strong point. so she seizes the bitchy role of a dame who treats a blind pianist with such scorn that even his dog growls every time she comes near him. an appalling blackface number is enough to gag on (using a leftover track from a cyd charisse film that never made the final cut), and her confrontations with michael wilding (the blind pianist), gig young (a drunken playboy, what else?), harry morgan (a stage manager/agent) and marjorie rambeau as her plain speaking mother, are all strictly theatrical, harsh and unconvincing. one thing i\\'ll say--she does \"haughty\" and \"overbearing\" so well, that it\\'s hard to remember that in real life she was so afraid of further humiliation by the cast and crew of hush... hush, sweet charlotte, that she left the film and feigned illness to get out of playing the role of cousin miriam. she also pleaded illness when she was afraid to attend the academy awards--afraid she might lose--but put her make-up on for the cameras when the radio announcement came that she won. nobody looks good in this one--but speaking of academy awards, marjorie rambeau got nominated for her mother role here. she\\'s not bad, but it must have been a dreary year for best supporting actresses. this one belongs near the bottom of joan\\'s career and surely any sane person would want to miss it--leaving it entirely to

two seems distinctly australian. i had not seen this when it was new, and i am glad. seeing a great film for the first time is a distinct pleasure. i can think of only two similar pleasures in life. reviewers often focus on the story; its the common currency for discussion. the interesting fact behind the power of this movie is that the story is incoherent, poorly developed. there are a few main characters and none of them are attached to what are considered necessities for storytelling. they are not introduced, we see them only through the effect of their presence. they do not develop. they influence nothing. the main character is presented as a sort of jane austen both an austen woman encouraged to marry, and austen herself as a sort of author-in-her-own-book, like we saw in the 1999 film of mansfield park. but the odd thing is that we have austen in australia, the role and all the expectations without the baroque mechanics of society swirling around. instead we get cows and sheep. and emptiness, a cinematic vastness that even the us has not yet produced, despite terence malick. so the incompleteness of the story is part of the genius of the thing. our heroine does not have an austenian future, instead becomes a backcountry louisa may alcott or george sand. indeed, davis did go on to play sand and anderson went on to direct \"little women.\" what our filmmaker has done is create a story where we subconsciously notice something is missing. and then she fills it with two things, this translucent actress and a similarly translucent open landscape. first the landscape. watch the opening of this. its genius, shooting from outside in, peering in through windows and doors while we see literally the story beginning to be written. then we shoot from the inside through the same windows out and see a dust tempest beginning. this notion of space, inadequate enclosure, book and heroine conflated into them and weaving through them was copied after a fashion in the opening for the 2005 \"pride and prejudice.\" here, it is fresh, original, shocking. effective, even life-affirming. you can see a similar master vision in how the ending is shaped. we see our woman, a best friend by this time, going to mail her book to us. she approaches the fence and her dog scurries under, unconstrained by fences. its a small thing, but by then we have become aware of how wonderfully our hidden woman behind the camera has shaped everything so minutely. that dog moves under the gate naturally, using a gait and hole that can only have come through hundreds of such exits. i have no idea how anderson did it. and now to ms. davis. over time you pick things from the film vocabulary that you cleave to, things that naturally tip into the bucket of your soul. one of these for me is a certain type of folded acting i have noticed in australian actresses. blanchett, winslet are the ones i follow deeply. but you can see it here and i imagine that this is the first appearance of the style in a competent film. in my own historiography, judy davis invented it and does so here. if you watch her manner, you can see cate. the style is what i call folded, where we get both the character and a higher level communication from the actor about the character. we have a few folded actresses. what\\'s even rarer is when the actress is intelligent and skilled enough to place that higher fold in the center of the filmmaker\\'s intention. it happens here. its beautiful, on a simpler level echoing the fact that we see a book, its making, and various considerations about the making of the book. because it is this sort of translucent folding, we see cate when we see judy. you will not soon forget that. i am putting this on my list of films you really must see. readers may be shocked. i only allow myself two from any given years and this year gave us \"alien,\" \"apocalypse now,\" \"manhattan,\" and \"tree of wooden clogs,\" all of which are bumped by this.

agree with the majority that jackson\\'s trilogy is the essential film adaptation of tolkien\\'s work, but that does not prevent me from enjoying bakshi\\'s ambitious pioneering effort. jackson has admitted that he received at least some inspiration from seeing bakshi\\'s film and there are some clear similarities between their adaptations. the film\\'s colorful picturesque backdrops are excellent and the score is memorable. i was for the most part satisfied by the drawings of the characters. the pairs of pippin and merry and eowyn and galadriel are mostly indistinguishable from each other visually, the balrog and treebeard were unimpressive, but these points did not bother me very much. however, the nazgul are aptly drawn and made sufficiently eerie. the only character representation i was bothered by was sam\\'s; he was made to look unbecomingly silly. this film is novel for its animation techniques. in addition to hand-drawn characters, live actors are incorporated into the animation through rotoscoping. it is quite apparent which characters are hand-drawn and which are rotoscoped, but none the less i found that the film\\'s style was a novelty. the use of rotoscoped live actors for the battle scenes was a good decision and helped these scenes turn out well. the voice acting was generally of high quality. particularly good was john hurt, who provided an authoritative voice for aragorn. aragorn is not a favorite character of mine from the stories, but backed by john hurt\\'s voice he was my favorite character in this adaptation. my other favorite was william squire, whose voice is appropriately strong for gandalf. the only actor who seemed inappropriate was michael scholes as sam, whose voice acting was irritating and added to sam\\'s unfortunately silly image. the only other bothersome part of the voice acting is the mispronunciation of character and place names. particularly strange was the decision to frequently have saruman referred to as \"aruman\". in producing this film, ralph bakshi expected to have the ability to produce two films. hence, this film contains about half the story, from the start of \"the fellowship of the ring\" to the end of the battle at helm\\'s deep in \"the two towers\". the obvious implication of this is that the film\\'s story is a highly condensed version of the story from the books. i enjoy the original stories and more thorough adaptations, but the liberties taken to compress the story did not bother me, even the choice to leave arwen out of the story. enough of the key elements of the story were in this film to keep me engaged for the duration and there was even a novelty in being able to breeze through half the lord of the rings story in 132 minutes. the battle scenes were impressive and in particular the orc march to and battle at helm\\'s deep were tremendous. ralph bakshi\\'s version of \"the lord of the rings\" is not perfect and no doubt a number of lord of the rings readers lament the cuts to the story. however, for me the drawbacks of this film were minor compared to the thrill of seeing an effective adaptation of half of a great trilogy. my only strong lament is that i am unable to see the second part of this \"first great tale\" of the lord of the rings since bakshi was not given the budget to create a sequel.',\n"," 'during the civil war, there

jones's premise of an item taken from the long island house that causes spectral misery and death for its new owners. first a lamp, then a clock, and now a mirror. however, this is also the first amityville since 'the possession' to directly tie in to the real- life events that started the whole series. this time around, keyes terry (robert partridge), an artist, is given a macabre-looking mirror by a homeless man one day. soon enough, people around him start to die, eventually leading to his discovery that the mirror once hung in the amityville house - indeed on the very night a man named franklin bronner (sonny montelli in 'amityville ii') murdered his entire family. unfortunately for terry, his discovery of the mirror is not entirely coincidental, and he soon learns the truth about his past a truth he's kept buried since childhood. this 7th installment in the often worn-out franchise is something of a disappointment for me. things were starting to pick up with the silly and uneven, yet entertaining 'it's about time', and given how much this film tries to draw upon its roots - not the first episode, but the source material itself - it should have been better than it was. however, three trips to the same well with yet another evil artifact from the amityville house with yet another explanation for the malign paranormal visitations is wearing on me, to say the least. one of the biggest weaknesses of the amityville franchise is the steadfast determination by each set of producers to completely ignore every other episode in the series. on the one hand, it's perfectly reasonable that they do not want to be tied to someone else's continuity, but at the very least, they could maybe acknowledge story lines that have already been done and just possibly *not repeat them over and over again*. there's also something rather plodding about the way in which the story unfolds, doubtless due to the inevitability this repetition-fest brings. since you already know what's going to happen, the carefully-paced build-up is simply slow and tedious. or maybe it's just tedious anyway. director john murlowski probably could have done more to heighten the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror rather than simply having it flash red and emit chattering 'evil' voices, which lacks any kind of subtlety. there were times when characters seemed fairly unfazed by its otherworldly qualities. if they do not take it too seriously, why should we? which is a shame, because 'a new generation' has a more-than-capable cast. i was going to hold off on watching this until i saw the name 'julia nickson' in the credits. she captivated my attention just as she always does, and if anything, i was annoyed her part was not more extensive. terry o'quinn was equally charismatic and again, underused. partridge himself in the lead role clearly fits the early 90s over-coiffed lumberjack-shirted square-jawed hero type, and while i am not sure he really gave it the gravitas needed, it's not as if anyone here is performing ibsen. the sets are also worthy of note, from the dramatic artwork filling suki's room, to the claustrophobic corridors featured in flashback/supernatural sequences. getting the look of these right is especially important given how certain sequences are repeated throughout the film to simulated fragmented memories. clearly, murlowski is more of a visual director rather than either an actor's director or one of horror. unfortunately, it is meant to be a horror film, after all. 'a new generation' sees the same race being run for the third time in 4 years. add to this the lack of direction where it was really needed and the whole effort fails to stand as tall as it should. however, it should be acknowledged for its strong ties with the source material and some good actors in not necessarily their finest hours. honestly, the ideal person for this is someone who has not seen any of the sequels past 'the possession', for whom the story will not be such a massive deja-vu trip.\",\n"," \"if the director was not claude chabrol, i am not sure this picture would have been released. it's a mystery story with a rather common theme. ordinary man meets strange girl with secrets and his values tend to change in dangerous ways, because of the passion. but the acting alienates the viewer. the dialog and the facial expressions do not mix together and you can not take the theme seriously. that's a problem in many french movies and not at least those of chabrol. maybe it's because one is too used to american actor manners, but i am not sure that's really the problem here. passions can be boring and this is unfortunately an example.\",\n"," \"this movie gives golf a high mark, it was well acted and well directed. giving you a view of history that some non-sports fans will enjoy. the historic factor alone gives it a high rating, the brookline golf course was really done well. i am in the northeast and have seen brookline as a fan, and as someone who loves the game. the movie was well done on all levels. a must see 5 stars. the acting was superb, disney has another winner in its bag of great movies. if for no other reason watch the film to give hope and encouragement to young people whom may not see the hope in their life. i would tell you that the setting, while in the late 1800's and early 1900's is very realistic. the costumes and dialect were right on the mark as well. above and beyond the call of duty for a golf film. a must see for fans and non-fans alike.\",\n"," 'supercraptastic slasher fare, which feels overly long at 80 minutes. years ago, a bunch of \"gypsies\" who lived in the caves of a mountain, were burned up in a forest fire. years later, campers are going missing from the area of the fire. a bunch of horny kids are, of course, en route to this area for a debaucherous camping trip of there own. despite an ominous welcome from the forest ranger (jackson bostwick) the kids troop up to the mountain any way. before long, the kids start to get picked off by the monster, who remains unseen to the very end of the movie, probably because the makeup was so embarrassingly bad. no surprises to speak of: they get killed in the exact order that the formula for these movies dictates, leaving the \"final girl\" to fend for herself, although in a refreshingly downbeat denouement, the final girl ends up imprisoned and impregnated by the monster. the story itself could not hold the weight of feature length, so it was padded out by seemingly endless shots of wildlife and insects, which were obviously shot for another film and inserted here haphazardously as a means of making the movie long enough for a video release. on the plus side, the wildlife footage is rather nice. also among the highlights are bostwick talking to a baby deer, a decent rock-climbing death sequence, ok gore, and the great jackie coogan in his final film role, as the bumbling local sheriff. this is a far cry from charlie chaplin, but it was still nice to see him. this is for slasher completists only.',\n"," \"i picked this film up based on the plot summary and critics' quotes on the back of the box. i am not big into foreign films, and did not know what to expect. i do not really care for subtitles either. but i absolutely loved it! it has a simple, lovable quality that leaves you feeling good about life. i found myself laughing out loud repeatedly. i'd recommend this picture to anyone, even those who abhor foreign films with subtitles. this one makes it worth the effort.\",\n"," 'in the end credits of \"shadows\", after we read \\'directed by john cassavetes\\', some white letters on the screen can be seen: \"the film you have just seen is improvised\", they say. i am always pursuing the fact that words are so important in movies since filmmakers started using them because, basically, there\\'s no film without a screenplay and many other reasons. cassavetes pursued the same goal, and he believed in the freedom of words; \"shadows\" is the perfect example. it\\'s a film with no real main characters, with no real main plot lines; it\\'s mostly people in different situations, talking. yes, some of the situations are connected but cassavetes, apparently always in a rush to get to the talking, uses a fast forward technique when the characters are going somewhere or escaping from someone and are not speaking. appearances are everything in this movie. for example, there\\'s a brilliant score, full of jazz influences and a lot of fantastic solos, and there\\'s one character that says he\\'s a jazz musician and plays the trumpet (ben, all the characters\\' names are the same names the actors\\'). however, we never see him play the trumpet or jam with a band; he does not even talk about music and just wanders with his friends around the city. they do talk, a lot, and about anything that\\'s in their minds; going from how intelligent each of them are to the hilarious analysis of a sculpture. \"shadows\" is funny in its intellectual references in parts like the one above, because these friends are not cultured. the only important female character in the film (lelia), though, wants to be an intellectual. but again, she has one very interesting conversation with an older man at a party, about a book she\\'s trying to write, and about how to confront reality; but nothing to do with being intellectual. at that same party, a woman is actually making an intellectual statement, full of complexity, and asks a guy beside her: \"do you agree?\". \"yes\", he says, but you can tell he does not know what she\\'s talking about. another character, a singer (hugh), talks about his glory days in occasions, and we see him perform only once; but no references to the musical industry there. the focus of cassavetes is the singer\\'s relationship with his manager (rupert), which most of the time involves chats about trivial stuff and not real \\'musical\\' talks. so the trumpet player\\'s important deal in \"shadows\" is the time he spends with his friends; the intellectual wannabe girl\\'s is her way of handling romantic relationships (one of the movie\\'s strong points) and the singer\\'s is the bond with his manager appearances. the reason why performances are not important in this movie is simple. cassavetes needed people who could master improvisation, without mattering if they were actually good. i believe some of them are not, but they surely know how to improvise in a scene, and you can notice how well they do it. \"shadows\" is not about performers; it\\'s about a way of making cinema, based on the magic of conversation; and there you could say that performances mean something. that\\'s why in every conversation the camera is like a stalker, constantly on the eyes of every character, constantly looking for the expressions that come with natural speech. there\\'s a scene where the trumpet player and his friends are trying to pick up some girls. they are three, so each of them sits beside one girl (the girls are three two) in three different tables. they all talk at the same time and the camera shoots through the table, and sometimes the friends look at each other, while they say whatever they are saying it\\'s natural.',\n"," 'slick, tidy, and well-made old school version of how a great international thriller should be made. determined to nail a feared global terrorist who is known as \"carlos the jackal\", jack shaw (donald sutherland, \"without limits\", \"space cowboys\"), a cia operative and his israeli counterpart, amos (ben kingsley, \"gandhi\", \"sexy beast\") get a noble naval officer, annibal ramirez (aidan quinn, \"music of the heart\"), to become carlos and use him in a daring plot to get the kgb to kill the real carlos, because he took an offer from the cia. sutherland and kingsley are both good here, but the movie really belongs to quinn here, who embodies himself here (in a dual role). director christian duguay and cinematographer david franco provide another great asset of the film here with hitchcockian-like suspense and great sights of the world.',\n"," 'humorous film involving a spirited young woman by the name of flora, who brings her stylish views of living, to the oppressed residents of a country farm. the humor at times is very dark and cutting, and oft times hilarious. they\\'ll be plenty of good, quotable material from this well-crafted film, to go around. my favorite: \"... drain the well, there\\'s a neighbor missing...\" the script is very slick, and the performances are even better. if you enjoy offbeat humor mixed with a really sweet story, you\\'ll like this movie.',\n"," 'certainly expected more after seeing the cast list, but wow! i think a first time director could have done a better job with this project, and the fact that a veteran like john buechler made it, puzzles me to no end. somehow, the budget allowed them to secure a bevy of d-list actors, whom they succeeded in embarrassing for an hour and a half. the unknown actors were just plain awful, less steve wastell who does a decent job as axl. the story is so bad, that it really needs no mention. the overall production value seems standard, with some above average camera work, if you can make it through the god-awful \"slo-mo\" scenes and the painful \"person on fire\" sequences. i knew it would be dumb, i just had no idea how dumb, and unfortunately it\\'s time spent that can never be returned to me. i suppose if you enjoy really bad \"b\" films, this might work for you, but if you value any story at all, this one is simply dreadful... a complete waste of time.',\n"," 'ever since i was a little boy, i was a big fan of the three stooges. i had seen every movie they ever made, except \"kook\\'s tour.\" when it was finally released on video in 1999, my jaw nearly hit the floor. unfortunately, my hopes were too high for what i was about to see. billed as \"their last and funniest film,\" the stooges simply take a camping trip and that\\'s about it. larry fine suffered a stroke and was unable to complete the filming, so norman maurer filled the remaining time with scenery and narration by moe howard. \"kook\\'s tour\" is indeed an important piece of stooge history, but it is not a worthwhile film.',\n"," 'all in all, an excellent movie from that time and source (coming from warner brothers as it was peaking in craftsmanship and style just before wwii), provided you do not take it at all seriously. the movie really makes no claim to being historically accurate, and is certainly no more or less accurate or believable than say, jfk. (this one may actually be more honest about it, though, as it essentially admits along the way that it\\'s not to be taken as particularly fact-based, but more of a stylishly semi-heroic portrayal.) it\\'s worth noting that audiences of the time were no more naive about the story than we are today; the ny times review conceded that audiences would \"dismiss factual inaccuracies sprinkled throughout the film,\" described the biographical account of custer\\'s life as \"fanciful,\" and pointed out that the presentation of custer\\'s motivations regarding the final events were at odds with various historical accounts. they could have really gone overboard in building up custer, one supposes, but they succeed admirably in depicting him as not necessarily the sharpest or most diligent guy around, but appropriately determined, principled and inspirational. flynn and dehavilland, doing their 8th movie together in 7 years (and their last), are so comfortable together, and play off each other so easily at this point, that it\\'s not too difficult to overlook how thinly their courtship is written here. with a first-time pairing, it would be hard to imagine what could really draw elizabeth to custer, but these two make it work. the movie is also missing their director from their previous seven films together (the greatly underrated michael curtiz), but given that he had worked with them on the previous year\\'s similar-themed santa fe trail, it\\'s understandable if he chose to opt out of this one. (they all started together with captain blood and the charge of the light brigade - both terrific - so we can not really blame them if they started having a tough time keeping it all fresh.) raoul walsh, the director here, is certainly more comfortable with the action sequences - which are outstanding - and everything else outdoors. the interior scenes are a little more uneven, but the studio craftsmen succeed in compensating for that very well, as does warner bros\\' outstanding cast of \"usual suspects\" and new faces (greenstreet, gene lockhart, anthony quinn, arthur kennedy, etc). i would have liked it better if kennedy\\'s character had been a bit less standard (i generally like his work), but here he seems to be hitting roughly the same notes in every scene; the part could have been better written - and i suppose they might have been unsure of what he could handle, as he\\'d only been in films for one year (walsh probably took him for this after doing high sierra together). various highlights include the depiction (probably imagined) of the genesis of \"garryowen\" as the cavalry theme. the last half hour is particularly outstanding, especially with the parting of the leads echoing the end of their screen partnership, followed by the final battle scenes. a thoroughly rousing adventure. 8 of 10',\n"," 'a fierce, shockingly intelligent piece of work from the gifted british writer hanif kureishi who wrote \"my beautiful laundrette\", (this is the best thing he\\'s done since then). it\\'s about intelligent people whose lives do not add up to much. they have squandered what they have been given and are largely empty vessels. the only character on screen who is alive is the mother of the title yet she feels dead inside until a rough handyman shows her some affection and awakens her to the joys of sex. he has his own motives but kureishi treats him with a good deal of compassion. this is a film in which people and places feel familiar, where characters exist beyond the confines of the screen. in some respects it\\'s a bit like \"sunday, bloody sunday\" but it\\'s an altogether tougher piece of work. the director, roger michell, allows scenes to build instinctively. and it is beautifully acted. as the eponymous mother anne reid betrays her wasted life in every gesture. there is not a false note in her extraordinarily lived-in performance, and that very fine actor daniel craig displays shadings to his character than even kureishi has not tapped into. if the film strikes a false note it is, perhaps, in the character of the talentless daughter, caught up in a messy affair with the man her mother seduces (or should that be the other way round) and even messier life, but she is so well played by cathryn bradshaw she hooks you in nevertheless. the film is also extremely beautiful to look at (dop alwin kuchler) and must rank, unhesitatingly, as the best british film of the year.',\n"," 'boris karloff gives a good performance as

class as, say, molly ringwald. this film, which was barely released, is just an extension of her late '80s/early '90s attempts to find a screen-persona which was identifiable to moviegoers, and it represents another failure. plimpton plays a troubled young woman who finds out on her 21st birthday that she was adopted and--worse than that--was actually abandoned as an infant on her parents' doorstep! she sets out to find her biological mother and father, but the viewer has no clue why she'd even want to (would simple curiosity give her this much determination?). unattractive material

doped with some sedative the slow, deliberate way they ponderously shuffle about. the dialogue is wholly unconvincing but, sadly, only occasionally risibly so. there were a couple of highlights. in one scene there's an interestingly designed basket of lemons hanging on the wall - i had time to commit to memory and it might work well as a wire basket. there are also numerous scenes of somebody playing billiards with himself (no, not pocket billiards!) on a real billiard table. you do not see many of those about these days. they do not seem to have been clear about what language the film was supposed to be spoken in. it mainly has rhotic 'r's, but not always. it is beyond me why, when they were supposed to be french, they did not just hire real french actors and actresses - even if they then tried to speak english it would have been more authentic sounding. it would have been better in the original language with sub-titles. the garden looked just like you'd expect a hastily prepared film-set garden to look - quite unconvincing. the beard continuity is all over the place. the lead robot grows several beards that all look different. on top of all these failings, it is nastily, gooilly sickly- sentimental. mawkishness drives almost every scene. i wish somebody had told me to avoid this film. see it only if you want a kip. somebody must have bribed somebody a vast amount not to have this sent straight to dvd. amazingly the director also directed 'the red violin', a first rate film in almost every way - he must have been drinking himself into a coma every day since then or

with me because i know many little, ultimately insignificant, \"hard men\" like those shown here, the big fish in little ponds who would not last 5 minutes outside their comfort zone. and considine drags them outside that zone, bloodied, kicking and screaming. part bodycount flick, part emotional drama, part vengeance movie, it all adds up to one of the most satisfying pieces of work that the uk

story of his brother and we go back in time when the events began. fenton and adam are two young brothers living with their strict and religious father who, one day, claims that he has received a divine message from god asking him to kill the demons that appear to be regular human beings. he receives from god a list of names of demons to be destroyed and asks his sons to help him carry out this divine mission. this is an absolutely horrifying and suspenseful film that will keep you at the edge of your seat. the tension runs high, innocent people (or demons?) get killed and religious

korine splices in sound effects and jump-cuts that evoke both a feeling of futility and dogged liberation in the character\\'s dance routine. the first instance of the segment dealing with the nuns is also strangely poignant; father umbrillo (werner herzog) is an autocratic priest about to fly with some nuns over, and drop food into, impoverished areas nearby. in a scene that is both light-hearted and affecting, herzog must deal with a stubbornly enthusiastic local who wishes to make the plane trip with them in order to see his wife in san francisco. as the exchange develops, herzog draws out of the man a confession: he has sinned, and his frequent infidelity is the cause of his wife having left him in the first place. this scene, short and sweet, gains particular weight after one learns its improvised origins: the sinner is played by a non-actor who was on set when korine and co. were filming - and his adulterous ways had given him, in real life, a lasting, overwhelming guilt. henceforth, the film is hit-and-miss; a succession of intrinsically interesting moments that add to a frivolous, muddled narrative. whereas gummo and julien donkey-boy maintain their aesthetic and emotional weight via coherent structural frameworks, mister lonely feels like a victim of editing room ruthlessness. a few scenes were cut from the film, which would have otherwise painted fuller pictures of certain characters, due to continuity errors in costume - a result, no doubt, due to the absence of a shooting script and korine\\'s tendency for improvisation. one deleted scene in particular - in which \\'charlie chaplin\\' (denis lavant) and \\'madonna\\' (melita morgan) have sex - would have added much more emotional conflict to a scene later on in the film (i will not spoil it, but it\\'s there to deflate any feeling of warmth or celebration, and, as it is, only half-succeeds). the two strands of the narrative, unconnected literally, are best approached as two entirely different stories with the same allegorical meaning; one compliments the other and vice versa. (it\\'s something to do with the conflict between one\\'s ambitions and the reality of the current situation.) but there\\'s not enough of the herzog scenes to merit their place in the film, and so any connection between these two allegorically-connected threads is inevitably strained - and the inclusion is, in retrospect, tedious. this is an ambitious step forward from julien donkey-boy that suffers mostly, at least in the lookalike segments, from having far too many characters for the film\\'s running length, a flaw that would have been even worse had big star names played everyone (as was originally planned). with many of the imagery\\'s self-contained beauty, and moments of real, genuine connection with the soundtrack, this feels like it\\'d be much more suited to an art installation or photo exhibition. as an exploration of mimesis and the nature of impersonation, it\\'d lose none of its power - indeed, for me, it would perhaps be more impressive. the loneliness attached to iconic performativity (such as that encountered by both the icons themselves and those who aspire to be like them) is well-captured in images such as that wherein \\'marilyn monroe\\' (a gorgeous samantha morton) seduces the camera with a seven year itch pose in the middle of a forest, or when \\'sammy davis, jr.\\' (jason pennycooke) settles, post-dance rehearsal, with his back to the camera overlooking an incredible, tranquil lake. as it is, moments like these, and all those where the titles of randomly-chosen michael jackson songs crawl across the scene, are married to one another in a film narrative far less affecting than it should be. (for those who see it, i lost all faith during the egg-singing scene, late on. you\\'ll know which scene i mean because it sticks out like a sore thumb, as some sort of gimmicky attempt at the new cinematic language for which korine has previously been hailed.)',\n"," 'such was the question occurring to me as i struggled through yet another disastrously ridiculous scifi channel disaster movie. do they intend for their homegrown movies to be so cheap, so silly, so patently obvious in what passes for plot? i have watched half a dozen of these \"scifi channel world premiere event\" movies in the past year and each is uniquely, achingly bad in its own right. disaster zone: volcano in new york, however, brings bad into a new light. every hackneyed device of disaster movie development is employed to predictable, hackneyed affect: the hero, a burly tunnel digger, leads his crew of rough-but-capable misfits (local 147 \"sand hogs\") in a daring race against the volcano to save new york city from certain incineration by lava. along the way, he encounters his bitter ex-wife, a usgs phd who, apparently, is woefully unfamiliar with the indications of volcanic activity and must be convinced by mr. sand hog that what has been happening across the city is not actually terrorism. throw in some incompetent dhs and fbi investigators; an incredulous mayor and his scheming, corrupt deputy; a female sand hog whose daddy was a legend among sand hogs; a foreman who is overly safety-conscious, except when he\\'s not; and the unfortunate but gruesome deaths of several supporting \"color\" characters and you have got your standard disaster movie fare, all dressed up with nowhere to go except straight down the tubes. as seems to be the new standard, the volcano is not itself the \"enemy,\" typically the case in classic disaster movies; no, the volcano is the unfortunate result spawned by a greedy (read: evil) scientist of the \"mad\" persuasion who has drilled a 7-mile deep hole beneath manhattan into the earth\\'s molten core so as to capture the thermal energy and make bazillions of dollars. really. greedy, evil scientist guy has been able to pull this off with the help of the deputy mayor, who has greased palms all over the city in order to keep the drilling secret until such time as the thermal energy could be captured and the resulting power plant used to \"open franchises\" the world over. oh, and make greedy, evil scientist guy and deputy mayor filthy, stinking rich. once mr. sand hog has convinced dr. usgs that there really is a volcano developing beneath manhattan, it is up to local 147 to stop it. of course. with just 5 guys, two of whom die in the process. c\\'mon, you know how this goes: the greedy, evil scientist guy dies, the safety-waffling foreman dies, the homeless guy dies, the black guy dies, the hispanic pyromaniac dies in a column of lava, the female sand hog survives and mr. sand hog and dr. usgs get back together and suck face as the credits roll. in the 50s and 60s, we were subjected to horror movies populated with monsters created from nuclear testing. in the 70s, disaster movies became an art form, with man struggling - often in futility - against the ravages of nature: no way did george kennedy try to stop that 1975 earthquake, but he sure managed the aftermath really, really well. we would see disaster as the result of man\\'s folly - think \"the towering inferno\" for example - but also as the quirky acts of nature they are. there is no moral imperative in an avalanche: the best one could be accused of is getting what\\'s coming to them for being in the wrong place, against instructions. in these modern disaster movies, we are treated to scenarios in which garden variety pests (bees, bats, locusts and the like) become monsters created out of genetic engineering or toxic waste dumping, or the very planet itself rebels against its victimization at the hands of mankind, specifically, greedy evil scientist guys and their investors. that the department of homeland security plays so prominently in this story is, i think, indicative of the scare level living just below the surface of the american consciousness. perhaps we can console ourselves with thinking that we can have some control over terrorism when faced with the towering realities of volcanic activity. how much more helpless can a person be than in the face of a volcano? instead, as the fbi and dhs chase their tails around looking for bogeyman \"terrorists,\" science and tunnel workers overtake and control nature. one wonders if the scifi channel folks intended for this to be the moral of the story: terrorists, we can not catch \\'em but, boy howdy, we can put a hurt on a natural disaster! one doubts that such a \"lesson\" is the purpose here, as it seems very little in this tv movie is planned out that well. the clichés are working overtime, the special effects are not, and you and your sweetie can project the plot line almost to a certainty. there are no surprises in disaster zone: volcano in new york, except perhaps your own surprise at your willingness to waste two hours of your life on such dreck. not a bad way to snozzle away two hours on a bitterly cold saturday night, but those are two hours of your life you will never get back. if you must watch this movie, invite some friends over and make it a party.',\n"," 'this is the worst kind of film. the plot is ludicrous, the characters are unrealistic stereotypes who never look like they believe it themselves. are white people such monsters that they will continue to call two white child rapists in their 20s \"good boys\" and need to be persuaded that this might be grounds for provocation? are black people universally inspiring? do the ku klux klan really stand outside court rooms shooting at lawyers with nobody intervening? do judges really think that a fair trial can be conducted when the jury can hear a mob outside shouting \"kill him\"? do black people really stand shoulder to shoulder with the klan waiting to hear the verdict? do wives really take several months to realise that their husband might be defending a man from unfair hanging because he knew might have done the same thing? do juries really acquit people of murder because they feel sorry for them? do lawyers really use a defense of sanity in order to persuade people that their client was temporarily insane? worst of all, any high-minded principles of this film were lost to the completely exploitative and gratuitous use of sexual crime to titillate the audience. was the subject of rape, let alone child gang rape, really in competent hands here? is it really a subject that belongs in hollywood hands? and if so, why the completely gratuitous kidnap and stripping of sandra bullock? and the completely pointless statutory rape charge against one of the witnesses? seems like the director did not feel that strongly about sex crime after all. this was taking the excellent plot of to kill a mockingbird and making a crass, shallow, tasteless money-spinner from it. shame on them.',\n"," 'yes, christopher plummer\\'s accent and antics are, to the the least of it, peculiar, but trying to see this as a historically accurate epic seems to be missing the point. the original play was by peter shaffer - he of amadeus and equus, and this film follows the same themes - the conflict and tension between between (according to interpretation) real and apparent power, or between ability and genius. the tension between atahualpa and pisarro is along the same lines as between mozart and salieri, or the boy and the psychiatrist. one has the trappings of power and success, but who really has the raw power? seeing it as a historical epic is a mistake - just as \"becket\" is a very modern take on a different battle of wills.',\n"," 'uzak (2002), a turkish film shown in the u.s. as \"distant,\" was directed, produced, written, and filmed by nuri bilge ceylan. this movie is a gritty and somber version of the clash between a \"city mouse,\" mahmut, played by muzaffer özdemir, and a \"country mouse,\" yusuf, played by emin toprak. both men are superb actors, and the plot allows them to demonstrate their acting skill. (tragically, emin toprak died in an automobile accident shortly after the movie was completed.) in most country cousin/city cousin tales, the contrast between rural and urban life styles is portrayed in a humorous fashion. in this film, there\\'s little humor or even warmth. both men have lost touch with human society. mahmut \\'s work as a commercial photographer for a tile company gives him no satisfaction. he has divorced a woman he clearly still loves, and has no satisfying human relationships. mahmut has lost his job because of a factory closing in his small town, and does not have the skills or the energy to find work in the city. his human interactions are primarily confined to silent observations of the other people who cross his path. he\\'s clearly a warm and caring person, but can not express these qualities in an urban environment. the cousins do not relate well to the world, and they do not relate well to each other. neither makes an effort to act in a way that would provide an opportunity for bonding or closeness. in a sense, this film portrays an opportunity wasted. conceivably, each cousin could have provided at least part of what was lacking in the other\\'s life. instead, they steer parallel unhappy courses. the two men are distant throughout, which is a situation suggested by the film\\'s title. one of my friends mentioned the masterful way in which ceylan builds detail upon detail. these details ultimately tell us more about the characters than we might have learned by simple exposition. uzak was shown as part of the rochester labor film series. it\\'s not a \"labor film\" in the traditional sense of that genre. it is a labor film because it demonstrates the harmful effects of unsatisfying work (mahmut) and unemployment (yusuf). this is a quiet, absorbing, dark film. although it does not make for happy viewing, i walked out of the theater realizing that i had seen a truly creative and important movie. this film is worth finding and seeing!',\n"," 'this has to be one of those times you come across a movie with a neat cover, my first impression, sweet, full moon, crows, a scarecrow holding a scythe. ok my impression (i had watched scarecrow on tv a weeks ago) perfect, a nice slasher film to start the evening with... wrong, absolutely wrong i think 5 mins in i was gonna take it out, but thought i wasted 3$ on this so ill finish it wheres the scarecrow, well im guessing its the legs of the fisher man wearing heavy duty rain boots. you see that every so often. i was watching this thinking... ok when are those brats gonna run into this dude, at one point i thought they died. but no... i mean frig, their still alive. i only chuckled at a few parts cause of how badly staged they were. one was the zoom in part at the start. the director/actor/writer says, \"remember i had that feeling, well i have it again\" and it was either a zoom in or zoom out, to hell i am checking back. but i guess the scene was supposedly shocking, i mean whats more shocking is his wife had the same shocked look... ok... she believed him? im sorry but yeah... i did not know he was psychic until i read the movie box to make some sense out of what i witnessed. not only that, they used pictures to make you think this movie is at least clear. the other thing that made me laugh a bit was the, scream in the camera, to make it scary... ok... filming a girl close up screaming into the camera for 5 mins... right... i laughed cause of how pathetic it was these kids cannot act like the rest of the people in the movie. to top things off the scythe must have got lost or something... cause seems the bad guy had just a stick. not even an ax, someone should axe the dam production film do not fall for the picture, this movie is a piece of sh*t. i watched the trailer and guess what it has girls where are you talk to me and corn',\n"," 'before i saw this show, i was completely against anime. that\\'s because most of the stuff that\\'s popular is the wide-eyed mindless \"i fell on you and accidentally touched your boob hehehe\" or \"haha the stupid chick found porn under his bed\" drama type stuff. however, this was completely different. the greatest thing about lupin is you get so much lupin. you get this series, the first and third series if you can get ahold of them, a lot of movies (though i only like a few), 2 manga series (one has not completely been out yet though, and there are others that have not been released in english) as well as lupin the first stuff (novels from maurice leblanc that lupin ii is based on, as well as movies based off those books, most being hard to get ahold of though), some people do not make their lupin stuff very lupin-ish though, so even if you do not really like what lupin is, there still is probably something with the lupin name you\\'ll like. lupin ii is about the greatest thief in the world and his two friends and partners, as well as a woman who he\\'s gaga for that milks him for all he\\'s worth. however, he also maintains a heart (and no, this is not one of those drama-ey shows either) and does end up saving lives. his main partner is daisuke jigen. he\\'s the gunman. he never misses, and nobody drawns faster then him. he has a strong dislike for women, most likely because the women he falls in love with die or betray him.. or both. then there\\'s goemon ishikawa the thirteenth. he\\'s based off a real person of the same name. his sword can cut anything (except devil\\'s tongue jelly, as i have heard), literally. the second he pushes up his sword, it\\'s already over. he often complains on having to waste his sword cutting useless things. then there\\'s fujiko mine, who\\'s said to be based off various models from playboy. she uses her sex appeal to get anything she wants from men, often betraying lupin in the process. of course, lupin always forgives her, because he\\'s crazy for her, but jigen and goemon knows she\\'s more trouble then she\\'s worth. lastly, koichi zenigata. based off heiji zenigata, a fictional officer that defeated people just by flinging coins. although, zenigata is not quite as skilled as him. well, not with lupin anyway. he\\'s sharp, but often is the comedy relief character when it comes to lupin. his whole life is chasing lupin, and if lupin died, his life would be worthless in his opinion. however, lupin\\'s not your average thief. he\\'s a gentleman thief. he always leaves notes saying when and what he\\'s going to steal. he does this all with the understanding that he does not kill anyone, and the cop who\\'s always after him does not kill him either. lupin is so huge, that many, many, many things have also been made after him, and do not be surprised if you find many references to him in other shows, movies, etc.',\n"," 'this film is enjoyable if you like poverty row, public domain films from the first half of the 20th century, or are a fan of amateur film-making. the film splices together public domain thrillers together along with newly shot scenes in which the \"actors\" (with the sole exception of redfield doing a near dead on lugosi rip, all of the \"performers\" are simply dreadful!) attempt to interact with the stock footage. the \"new\" footage is covered with digitally added film scratches, as is some of the already substandard old footage (?!). as near as i can figure out the plot has something to do with a bunch of strangers being brought together on an island for a will reading(?) this film, while boasting a creative premise ala \\'dead men do not wear plaid\\', is a technical and creative wreck. in one dreadfully over long sequence and injured sailor on a ship describes an abortive trip to \\'fog island\\', whatever that is! the \"flashback\" then incoherently weaves together old footage from totally different eras, and of totally disparate film quality. unrelated scenes from \\'the lost world\\' (1925), the most dangerous game (1932), white zombie (1932), bela lugosi meets a brooklyn gorilla (1952) and some other poverty row productions. this is done over an incredibly bad voice over which seems to have too much room echo as if the audio was recorded on a cheap home video camera. the \"filmmakers\" seem to think that they are paying homage to the great actors of yesteryear by giving characters the surnames of famous actors (carradine, zucco, ouspenskaya, etc.. etc..). this tactic was done cleverly, as well as subtly in \\'final destination\\' here it\\'s just obnoxious! bizarre, and painfully unfunny, jokes about spiderman, dracula, and superman abound. even the old as dirt \\'dewey, cheetam and howe\\' lawyer reference is used here-this was old and tired when the three stooges used it in the 1930s. the film stock and audio, do not match scene to scene, and dozens of different sources are used for lugosi. the finale effect is that he seems to be getting, older, younger, older, thinner, heavier, younger and older again minute by minute. oddly the film did not use this as a comedy subplot and squanders a good chance for comedy. truth be told though, it was great fun to watch this late at night in bed.

value of the movie, to have richer music written for it. it was mediocre music and it did not take away from the movie itself because the animation was so true to the majestic original. i believe that disney had a keen pedagogic sense. through his media resources he taught his young audiences (even the young at heart) to appreciate cultural manifestations: music, a very notorious one. so this is

excellent job in portraying a troubled ww1 ace. despite his success, he can not seem to forget that each victory equals him killing another human being. this inner turmoil continues throughout the film and climaxes when he is given yet another accolade. i do not want to spoil the film by revealing what happens next. but, it came as a bit of a surprise! the ending clearly makes the movie. by the way, the vcr box cover shows cary grant. yes he was an important supporting actor in this movie, but considering march's performance, it is a darn shame they are trying to capitalize on grant and not march. ps--if you liked this film, try watching the hard to find ace of aces, starring richard dix. it's very similar except that dix is a pacifist who only reluctantly goes to war. once he becomes a

commentary, pascal greggory and the director state that this is not a comedy about bisexuality, it is a comedy about sexuality and choices. this is so true. alain faces the choices we all face. does he choose the person who is more like a partner than a romance? does he choose the younger, eager lover who offers little more than sex? does he choose to pursue the yet-to-be-obtained intriguing person he has recently met? a few other peripheral choices also hover nearby. but even more basic questions are asked: does he have to choose? can he choose more than one option? will any choice make him completely happy if it cancels out all the others? this film made me reflect on these questions and choices in my own life, which is exactly what a good film should do. i think anyone who is over 30 and unmarried should be able to relate to alain, at least on this level. a few reviewers have asked why so many characters are attracted to the narcissistic, emotionally remote alain, but in my experience, it is often just this type of person who has many people attracted to him. for some, he is a challenge. for others, he is safely unattainable. for yet others, he is someone who will hurt them (which they expect), or who will not be hurt too much if they leave him. alain mirrors the other characters' loneliness back to them, and one wonders if any of them would be happy if they ended up being alain's choice and if he could ever stick with that choice. if you are happily content in a stable, long-lasting relationship, then you will see this film as a comedy about things that happen to other people. but if your heart still has the capacity to lead you in directions you do not expect, this film will have greater meaning for you.\",\n"," 'people may say i am harsh but i can not

off for a holiday in las vegas. while watching some in house entertainment at a casino claire is hypnotised by an english clairvoyant named cecil howard. claire suffers a vivid hallucination about a sadistic ss officer named olivier (robert bristol) in a nazi concentration camp. after the show claire talks with howard and invites him to supper. soon after she leaves howard is killed by what appears to be a red light (do not ask). meanwhile a old jewish man named abraham weiss (marc lawrence) who is a nazi hunter spots olivier on a t.v. programme and recognises him as the man he has been after for years. weiss immediately tells his story to bitter, overworked police officer lieutenant sterne (cameron mitchell) who lives just across the hall from him. sterne agrees to look into weiss's claims but eventually admits there is nothing he can do, especially after weiss gives him some newspaper cuttings from 1944 which appear to show olivier but since the paper is over 30 years old and olivier would now be in his 60' or 70's and the guy on t.v. is still in his 20's & therefore weiss's story is psychically impossible. that night weiss is found dead in a parking lot. lt. sterne decides to take a personal interest and investigate even further. claire is starting to lose her mind. her husband james is about to publish a book called 'god is dead' in which james claims god does not and never has existed. claire as a stout catholic is deeply against the book and tries to convince james not to publish it. olivier, who runs a cult of satan worshippers, feels james would be a good person to have on board and attempts to convince james to join him and his organisation. a guy with a beard named papini (maurice grandmaison) tries to warn james about olivier, satan and his book denouncing god. various people die including claire's nephew jim (klint stevenson), claire decides that she alone must put an end to olivier and satan himself. claire and jim's girlfriend ann (christie wagner) conduct a bizarre plan that claire believes will destroy olivier for good, but will it succeed? according to the imdb's credit list cataclysm was directed by three separate people, phillip marshak, tom mcgowan & gregg c. tallas as greg tallas. i am not sure if this information is correct but i do not think i have ever heard of a film directed by three different people and maybe that's why it turned out to be a bit of a jumbled up mess. the script by philip yordan tries something different and for that it should get at least an extra point. even though at the end of the day it's still a mess with the story all over the place. things just happen for little reason, characters are not that likable and the dialogue in certain scenes is not up to much. the story becomes occasionally confusing and unfocused. the script comes across as heavy handed at times with it's religious overtones and story arc. almost as if yordan wanted to make a thought provoking horror film with a message, obviously it fails, badly. cataclysm starts out very interesting and draws the viewer in by not revealing too much, too soon. unfortunately this decision to try and make the plot more mysterious back fires during the middle third as it gets somewhat boring waiting for something to happen but then things explode into a gore drenched finale. the acting is ok for this type of low budget nonsense, except cift who seems to speak her lines really slowly compared to everyone else. and it's always nice to see genre veteran cameron mitchell. some characters appear dubbed throughout. there is very little, in fact none, blood or gore in the film until the last 10 minutes or so when the red stuff is splashed everywhere. in this sequence there is some real surgery footage in a blood soaked over the top climax to round the film off. i think the film itself was shot on location rather than studio's and has a generally good feel throughout, the production values were much better than i expected. while not brilliant by any stretch of the imagination the photography, editing, special effects, continuity and music are all reasonable enough and i have sat through a lot worse. i am sure a lot of people will automatically call this film crap as it's an easy target but for those of us who like this sort of off-beat grade-z low budget horror film from days gone by than this one may interest you and is probably worth tracking down. just because it dares to try something a little different if for no other reason, it does not always succeed but at least those involved tried. overall i am glad i watched it, certainly not the best film in the world but then did anyone really expect it to be?\",\n"," \"the first review i saw on this site about this movie was someone calling it a masterpiece. this movie is as much a masterpiece as friday the 13th iv is not a masturbation piece. and that does not even make sense. but neither does this movie. spoilers- i could sum up this movie by saying it's about a fruity looking swedish kid who moves into a house with his parents and eventually watches them get murdered in the basement by some 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm. however, i'll add a little more... first of all this movie is crazy boring. secondly, it involves some 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm. now those two sentences should not be referring to the same movie, but in this case they are. from what i can piece together the family moves into this house out in the countryside so the dad can research the death of a colleague who also lived in the same house. the colleague basically hung himself as a result of living in a house haunted by an 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm. like in many haunting movies the colleague dude conveniently left a cassette tape explaining just enough about the bad stuff going on in the house to make the viewer decide not to turn off the movie yet. as you continue to let the movie play you'll quickly realize you made a mistake. so the family moves to the house and the swedish boy starts seeing some 1800's-ish looking girl, but it's hard to tell since this movie was made in the 70's. her clothing may have been normal small town 70's gear rather than 1800's gear. also some googly eyed babysitter chick shows up and generally acts strange, but never does anything and is eventually killed. which does not make a lot of sense because there's a scene where an 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm (yes the 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm) kills some broad in the house and the babysitter cleans up the blood the next day to hide it. so if she's helping this basement monster out why does he later trap her in his basement and kill her? maybe she did not do a good enough job of cleaning up the blood and she was already on thin ice with him to begin with. general strange noises and what not happen in the house and at some point there is the discovery of a grave in the living room, which is obviously where this 1800's doctor is buried. or is he buried? well he might be. whether or not he's the guy in the basement with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm is up to speculation, but it is mentioned in the movie that the doctor performed devious experiments when he was alive. so the doctor either created this basement monster or he is him. either way, the movie is so boring you will not care. all you'll care about is why this guy in the basement is 99% monster except for his one normal arm. in summary you could say this movie is about a family being haunted and eventually killed by an 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm or you could say it's about a family being haunted and killed by an 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one human arm. but no matter how you look at it, they all die and you'll also die a little inside when you go to google this house so you can stay there for a night and make your own bootleg ghosthunters tv show and try to sell it to the travel channel only to find out that you can not even find this house because nobody cared enough to put it's real location anywhere on the internet.\",\n"," \"crossword puzzles, and the many people who make them popular, are the focus in wordplay, including the editor of the ny times puzzle (the most notorious of them in the usa), celebrities and politicians, and the general public obsessed with them. as a documentary wordplay is good, not great, film-making about its subject with a couple of montages and interlocking scenes that are weak. but the subject matter, and usually how its presented, sparks a fine interest even in a non-crossword puzzle player like myself. as words are all that we have to work with in communication and just everyday discourse, it's also attached here to the idea of testing, of competition, and how different and varying crosswords can get. like the documentary spellbound from a few years back, the director is also after the kind of irony of making such an isolated experience of finishing a puzzle into an event with hundreds of players once a year with friendships and acquaintances- a social event as much as a match-up. many parts are amusing as well; we get interviews from jon stewart, bill clinton, bob dole, and the editor of ny times crossword himself, will shortz, and they all give some insightful, funny little bits of interest into making the puzzles and playing them. but for the most part we are into the mind-set of several key players, real people whom will all come together for the tournament in jaunary. what makes all of this work, and what actually makes crossword puzzles become good enough for cinema, is watching smart people, un-cluttered for the most part with problems, who can focus all of their attentions on this one activity, to the point of obsessive compulsive behavior. it's really fun, in a nerdy way, trying to guess some of these words (or rather watching them guessing the words) along with the players. and the way the puzzles are created sparks a little interest too, as it's one of those parts of life i myself could never, ever accomplish. worth a look, though probably more so for fans of the activity.\",\n"," \"this ranks as one of the few documentaries, along with littlest soldier, where his

art imitating life. even if you do not think real images of scenes usually reserved for horror movies are moving, the photography of the colors of the sun through the smoke and fire is stunning. and those who think it's politics are one sided should note the equally graphic details of the results of both sides' work. for those that do not remember, there was a little action in the persian gulf in 1991.\",\n"," 'what we have here is a downright brilliant piece of early 80\\'s incompetence that will render even the biggest connoisseur of trash- cinema completely speechless! \"wizards of the lost kingdom\" is a very cheap and cheesy fantasy/sword-and-sorcery adventure that does not have an actual plot but does eagerly & shamelessly borrows elements from other films. writer ed naha and hector olivera (who?) watched enough similar type of movies to know that they needed a handful of essential characters, but probably figured that all the rest would follow automatically. in order to make a fantasy-adventure you need: one super- evil villain (preferably with a black cape), one young hero in training, one lone warrior, one amiable type of furry pet, one wise midget living in the woods (optional) and a whole colorful collection of hideous demons, enslaved dwarfs, and winged gargoyles to serve as filler. the story is phenomenal and so original, with simon the young son of a wizard having to flee from his beloved kingdom after the evil magician shurka takes over the power and killed the king. simon wants to go back and save the people, but therefore he needs his powerful ring which he lost during his escape. simon befriends lone warrior kor (the usually cool dude bo svenson who clearly needed the pay check), who assists simon during the long and devastating journey full of ordeals, dangerous encounters and magical showdowns. admittedly it does not even sound too bad thus far, but that\\'s merely just because i excluded all the deliciously inept little details. simon has a best friend named gulfax, for example. gulfax is an albino version of chewbacca and evokes incontrollable chuckles whenever he opens his poodle-snout to yelp something incomprehensible. the obstacles during journey back home are hilariously irrelevant to the \"plot\" and simply serve as padding footage to cover up the lack of actual content. simon has nightmarish visions inside the tent of a suspicious forest nymph, kor settles an old score with the pig-faced nemesis whose sister he refused to marry and there\\'s the supposedly horrible \\'suicide cave\\' where you can only sing your way out of. but the absolute most unequally brilliant sequence not just of this film alone but in the history of cinema involves the resurrection of four zombie warriors. simon awakes the legendary courageous warriors, hoping they will assist them in their battle, but the rotting corpses only take a few steps, complain about how tired they are and return back to their graves. that\\'s it! so much for the zombie sub plot! best sequence ever! i could go on listing unintentionally hilarious little details for several more paragraphs, but you get the idea. \"wizards of the lost kingdom\" is a tremendously messed-up \"so-bad-it\\'s-good\" film. word of advice: do not watch this joyful piece of junk alone. invite friends, preferably the dope-headed types with a wicked sense of humor, and watch it in group. it will be a night to remember',\n"," \"i have watched this movie twice, and i plan to see it again. it is the movie that puts you in the director's place, regarding his romantic

masterpiece, this ain\\'t it. if you are looking for one of those awful movies that are so horrible that they are actually good, then this may be for you. there are so many unintentional laughs in

movie was about a pumpkin by the giant pumpkin shown on both the cover and in the opening scene of the movie. after that, the movie goes in about 20 different directions, none of which make much sense. jack-o is everywhere, he\\'s in people\\'s houses, in the woods, and yet he does not ever seem to do much of anything. he does make a few kills, but the long buildup to those killings is so poorly acted and constructed you almost wish jack-o would take out his rage on you the viewer. other than that, the plot consists of poor acting, gratuitous nudity, and a ridiculous plot line. the acting in this film is among the worst i have ever seen in my 35 plus years of movie-watching. the boy who is the lead in the film (the director\\'s son) has about as much emotion as a corpse, and just about all of the other actors/actresses are just as bad for numerous reasons (especially the bug-eyed lady with eyes bigger than saucers). but, having said all this, if you take this for what it is, (that is a steaming pile of dung) then you will get a few laughs from this movie. what i also found amusing is that the makers of the dvd saw fit to release a \"10th anniversary version\" of this movie (as if the original was not good enough). and someone actually had the idea of making a \"behind the scenes\" mini film which is also included in the 10th anniversary edition (i am not sure

everyone out (well, almost everyone) - and he's figured this out by the look exchanged by those two men. he got a very good look at the other guy. yet, they never follow up on that lead. it's a courtroom in d.c. surely there is surveillance footage they could be going through to identify this man. they never do that. they forget about him entirely. in fact, brosnan never mentions this guy to

about who might be against this bill, who might want him dead, he just yells at him to stay away from his wife. and then later when they figure out that what the bomb is, and how it's detonated, they also figure out a very easy way to defuse it. i will not give it away here. but suffice it to say that in later scenes with a bomb, they never bother to try this method of defusing it. it's sloppy

story was about was having sex over and over again. there was no need for all of this footage - only to create a soft porn film. of course we had to see the heroin of the movie having sex for about 2 minutes. i do not know what all this had to do with the actual plot of the movie -except i assume to get men to watch it. i gave it 1 out of 10 only because there was no other rating lower. do not waste your money or time- it has nothing to do with science fiction but rather a movie for young adolescent boys to watch to see t&a. the creature was shown only more than half way through the movie

witch/vampire, countess wandessa. daninsky offers them refuge when they become lost, and it is not long before he becomes romantically involved with elvira (convenient, eh?). they find the tomb and stupidly remove the cross embedded in wandessa's rotting corpse. before long, the vampire arises and attacks genevieve, who becomes one of the undead herself. with a full moon on the way, bloodsuckers on the loose, and a werewolf for a boyfriend, can elvira save the day? the werewolf shadow lacks the gore and gratuitous nudity that usually make these affairs bearable, and despite some unintentionally chuckle-worthy moments, the film is rather slow and uneventful. there are some nice atmospheric scenes and the ladies are pretty easy on the eye, but this is still not reason enough to

that there was a crime lord, in this case a danny ludden, as compared to the kaiser sosa of usual suspects who nobody had ever really seen. yeah right. this movie tried to tell us that the danny ludden character owned property all over \"the city\", which they slipped and called detriot once, and controlled a gang that ran detroit, and no one had ever seen him. wow, this is an amazing concept. meanwhile the assistant da who ray liotta is banging is intertwined within the movie as a rape suspect/murder suspect who is thought to be black, but is really white. is the viewer to believe

dillon is now a mountain man, kitty has left dodge and newly o\\'brian the former gunsmith and deputy is now marshal. will mannon, the evil gunslinger who appeared in a self-titled episode of gunsmoke, is released from prison to kill matt and the judge who put mannon in prison. another prisoner, jake flagg, who is an old friend of matt\\'s, breaks out of prison by using the warden as hostage. flagg needs to warn matt about mannon. the gunslinger shoots the warden and flagg is now wanted by a young, overzealous deputy and some bounty hunters. several of the unscrupulous bounty hunters actually stab dillon who is found and taken back to dodge where he awakens to find miss kitty. matt tries to help protect flagg meanwhile mannon returns to dodge where he torments miss kitty as he did in the original episode. back then he had raped kitty and beat her, something matt did not know. okay, inconsistencies. first, but this is my opinion, matt would not have become a mountain man. it\\'s just not him(maybe they got him confused with his zeb macahan character from how the west was won). second, kitty explains why she left dodge. it\\'s a flashback from the episode \"the badge\" where matt is shot and kitty just can not handle seeing him hurt anymore. any fan of the show would know that this episode(do not know when it aired but certainly not in the last year of the show) ends with matt meeting kitty and sort of convincing her to come back, which she does. the movie made it sound like she never came back. amanda blake left the show in 1974. there are reports she claims she was sick and tired of the character and the commute(she was living in az at the time). others question that producer john mantley fired her for money reasons. they allegedly did not get along at all. third, in the episode mannon, he is apparently shot dead from how the episode ends but i guess it could have been interpreted as him possibly surviving. those are disappointments show-wise. other ones that made fans cringe are james arnesses\\' hair and make-up, absolutely scary. kitty looked her age and did not look bad at all. amanda blake had contracted aids and she later died from the disease 2 years after this film. ken curtis did not return, he reportedly wanted more money than blake. finally, matt and kitty never kiss at the end, they never even get together. she see\\'s him through a window and sheds a tear as he goes back to his lonely life. reportedly, the original script had matt walk into the hotel where kitty was(and you could use your imagination). there were too many flashbacks which took away from developing the plot to this movie. they actually show one flashback twice. john mantley produced the movie and i was surprised someone with such a grasp on gs let this be the end product. also, the cover art for the movie on this website only show\\'s james arness. there is another version which has a small picture of kitty on it. otherwise, it\\'s fun to see m&k back together.',\n"," 'i love this movie! i know some people might say that it was not a great movie, but i really disagree. the comedy is classic mel brooks style and the actors

great comedic timing and the right attitude for this type of film. dave chappelle is obviously much bigger now, but at the time this was his first movie and he did an outstanding job as achoo. the

aaw yeah. as vincent canby said in his review, from 1970 in the new york times, 'fellini satyricon is its own justification'. this movie exists purely to engage on an aesthetic level. the surrealism, the carnival-of-life atmosphere, the monumental pageantry, the visual juxtaposition of beauty and ugliness, and the black humour are all the film possesses and are all it requires. i believe that fellini's intention with this film was simply to entertain. and he was a master entertainer, no doubt. do not expect much in the way of characterisation, of complex plot developments, or of nifty moral expression. this is a film that looks and sounds beautiful, and it manages to hold your interest (or mine anyway, i can not speak for everyone) for two brief hours by doing just that. fellini = godlike genius.\",\n"," 'i am shocked that all the \"hated it\" ratings are sixes and sevens, still above average. to me, this seems a case of \"the emperor has no clothes\". i understand this film was produced on a very low budget in the early 70\\'s... regardless, it became a struggle to sit through and watch. the dvd i saw did have some subtitles, but about 75% of the speech is not subtitled. some of it is hard to understand. the jamaican patois was cool to hear, but you struggle not to \\'tune out\\' after awhile. some of the shots were nice, and the realism was there, even if some of the performances were not great.(jimmy cliff did a good job) the plot is not bad, but quite predictable. in the 1:43 film, the highlights are jimmy cliff(ivan) singing for a scene, and a couple of shoot-outs and a fight. probably 15 minutes or so. the rest is pretty boring. btw, near the beginning of the film, there are some weird cuts with the ivan character that seem like a editing mistake, which made me laugh for a bit. one reviewer said this film has been cut so many times, that there are few copies of the original 1972 theatrical version out there. the ending was kind of interesting, showing how the media from a young age influences people, it could also be a general comment on the white man\\'s/colonialism\\'s influence on jamaica. other main themes are poverty, corruption, church, ambition... in closing, the soundtrack is definitely worthwhile, the film much less.',\n"," \"rififi is a great film that is overlooked. it's a crime drama where a man gets out of jail and plans another job. it's an over used story but this one is different from the others. they round up the usual suspects for the job. this film takes a look at how the family gets torn apart as time goes on. the actual heist scene is one of the best i have ever seen. instead of a suspenseful soundtrack the director decided to go with silence, around thirty minutes of silence. this fits the mood perfectly and is often copied these days. of course things get out of hand and people die and it ends in a great ending that builds up in suspense. so if you are looking for a great film noir that not a lot of people talk about this is a great pick up.\",\n"," 'how much of the average american population would be entertained by watching two dull, lifeless middle-aged men play a chess game for 2 hours and 18 minutes? i can pretty much assure that number is pretty small. i personally love to play chess, but if you were to force me to sit and watch people do it, i\\'d feel like committing suicide after the first thirty minutes. that\\'s about how i felt watching sleuth. the entire movie is absolutely nothing but two men playing a dull game from the opening to the closing. there camera never leaves the house for the entire runtime. the most diversity in the entire movie is some minor clothing changes and some facial expressions. the entire movie is straight-up dialogue and nothing else. the entire movie is two long, dull scenes, with one scene change near the middle. if you have less of an attention span than the average person with down syndrome, you\\'ll be bored to the point of nausea long before the 30-minute mark. there is about as much entertainment value in sleuth as there is in watching a tree stump rot, and that may even be an overstatement, because at least doing that you can use your own imagination. here, the most imagination you get is two men, four walls, and an insane amount of bland conversation. if that describes what you consider an entertaining movie, sleuth will keep you on the edge of your seat for sure. people would argue that the conversation scenes i reference carry the \"clever plotting\". in other words, the conversation scenes carry a cute, predictably plot-twisted story revolving around all the clichés that we have seen since the camera was invented. there is nothing clever about the plot. sure it has a couple twists that will make you shed an \"awe, that was cute!\" smile, but they are the same plot twists you have seen countless times. this is a clichéd murder story, folks. it\\'s not some hyper-original idea. if you saw a single sherlock holmes episode as a kid, you have seen everything this movie has to offer. if the plot were truly clever or creative, it would do something new or different. the other problem with the plotif you even call it a plot; i don\\'tis that it\\'s so predictable. no, you may not have any lead-ons as to who-killed-who or who\\'s-dead-who\\'s-not, but does it really matter? the outcome is always the same. you are always told the answer, and there\\'s always only two options. it\\'s the most basic immature plot line known to man. i have seen cartoons that put this plot to thumb-sucking shame. who really cares anymore? i overuse the metaphor in my reviews, but a movie this unoriginal is like a joke you heard in kindergarten and then someone tries to make you laugh at that joke when you are 80-years-old. it\\'s ineffective. it\\'s pointless. even if you force a laugh, you still feel annoyed. i understand this movie was made in the 70s. people will defend it by saying, \"there was nothing like it when it came out!\" and they are dead wrong. all their doing is defending their deep sense of nostalgia. in reality, this movie was just as unoriginal in 1972 as it is in 2009. and do you know what\\'s sadder? movies just like it are still being made, and they are still getting acclaim. it makes me sick. we do not need another paper-thing whodunit murder mystery with the same predictable results. what the mystery genre needs is maturity. instead of pumping out more kindergarten level plot line movies like this, why not actually think of an, you know, actual story to support the mystery. that\\'s something directors/writers obviously did not get back in the 70s, and it\\'s something they still do not get today. instead of focusing on plots, why not focus on story? overall, sleuth is a complete waste of time. it has a couple of intelligent high-brow lines, but i could get those from my dying grandfather. why do i have to watch a pointless movie to hear them? and, similarly, i could get the same predictable level of mystery of watching this movie from playing the clue board gamealone. why do i have to watch a pointless movie to do so? the more i think about it, i cannot find a single redeeming value in sleuth whatsoever. it\\'s long, boring, dull, pointless, lame, slow, uninteresting, paper-thin, predictable, annoying, pathetic... and most of all, sleuth is exactly the same story you have seen hundreds of times, yet it expects you to be enthralled. now that is a clever joke. 0/10',\n"," 'there were some great moments of reality in there depicting modern

'intense episode in which a shuttle craft mission lead by spock crash lands on a most unpleasant world. indeed, the dangers posed by it\\'s hostile environment leads to a hostile crew as spock finds his leadership abilities called into question. hal and bog in their reviews have already done a fine job of exploring how the vulcan\\'s logical approach to the crisis proves ineffective in dealing with the stressed-out humans under his command. the only thing to add might be that spock, at times, displays an almost human surliness that seems very un-vulcan. but, since this was a first season episode, it may have been filmed before leonard nimoy had fully come to understand his character and the proper way to play him, (for example, he was still speaking with that put-on british accent like when he pronounces the word command as \"commond\"). clearly, this is not the more controlled mr. spock we would see in later episodes like \"the doomsday machine\", but it\\'s still a good performance and the script provides an interesting set of problems to watch the usually unflappable character try and overcome. as if crash landing was not bad enough, the primates that live on the planet were a neat addition to further complicate spock\\'s bad day. glimpsed more than they are seen (and a wise move, too as the only creature shown up close looks like it\\'s wearing a fur dress), these hairy monsters prowl about in the fog making hissing noises and echoing roars. they attack with huge spears, and in one scene maul a comparatively puny human to death. thoroughly nasty, their

exhausted and maybe a touch traumatized, kelowitz cautions kirk that if the missing shuttle craft crew are on that planet... well, he does not have to finish the sentence for kirk to get his meaning. it\\'s an effective little touch that casts a shadow of dread on the possible fate of kirk\\'s missing crew members. in fact they should have used this seldom seen character of kelowitz more often as he would have made a great running feature. like scotty\\'s dire warnings about the condition of the ship\\'s engines, or those red shirted security men who were always first to bite the dust, you\\'d know the situation was dire if kelowitz showed up with a new batch of bruises and another alarming report for kirk.',\n"," 'watching stranger than fiction director marc forster\\'s the kite runner is the cinematic equivalent of eating your vegetables because this art-house epic rated pg-13 is good for your movie-going diet. no, this is not the kind of movie that i like to slouch on the couch and eyeball at the end of a tough day. the kite runner is not your typical mainstream movie designed to entertain you and make you forget about your troubles. first, no celebrity stars appear in it. second, nothing is cut and dried, black or white, or so outlandish that you do not believe an image that you see. third, the kite runner lapses into subtitles when the characters occasionally speak in their native tongue. fourth, forster\\'s film is not a romantic trifle about boy-wants-girl, boy-loses-girl, and then boy-wins-girl back. fifth, this foreign language film may make you feel uncomfortable and challenge your assumptions about life, friendship, and survival. the chief themes here are cowardice and redemption. the protagonist commits a cowardly offense in the first half of the action that he must atone for at the cost of his own personal safety and integrity. right, the kite runner is about redeeming oneself for the sins of the past. we are talking about personal accountability, so do not rent or buy this wonderful movie for a boy\\'s night out celebration or something to take the bad taste of the day out of your system. based on khaled hosseini\\'s bestselling novel, this culturally enlightened melodrama about right and down initially looks like one of those light-hearted friendship movies about adolescents in the vein of the adventures of tom sawyer and the sandlot. about a half-hour into its 127 minutes, this escapade about two youngsters who fly kites in afghanistan turns dark and unsavory. nevertheless, if you can handle the remaining hour of the plot, you\\'ll emerge gratified, relieved, and perhaps even entertained. the kite runner opens in san francisco in the year 2000 as our protagonist, afghan émigré amir jan (khalid abdalla of united 93) and his wife soraya (atossa leoni of the florist) receive two boxes of published copies of amir\\'s first novel. no sooner has amir had a chance to bask in his triumph of a life-time as a storyteller than the phone jars him from his reverie and he is drawn reluctantly back into a past that is best left forgotten for him. rahim khan (shaun toub of the nativity story) calls amir from pakistan to make a request. rahim was a servant in amir\\'s household back in the 1970s when amir lived with his wealthy pashtun merchant father baba (homayoun ershadi of a taste of cherry) in afghanistan before the soviet invasion. \"you have one more chance to be good,\" rahim informs amir without sugar coating his request. basically, rahim wants amir to fly to pakistan and then enter war-torn afghanistan and rescue rahim\\'s young grandson sohrab (ali danish bakhty ari) who is being held a prisoner against his will as a sex slave for assef (newcomer abdul salam yusoufzai) a cruel taliban chieftain and amir\\'s once dreaded adversary. the kite runner shifts from san francisco in 2000 to an extended flashback set in kabul in 1978 when life was idyllic. twelve-year-old amir (zekiria ebrahimi) and the son of his father\\'s servant, hassan (ahmad khan mahmoodzada) love to watch movies, such as john sturges\\' western the magnificent seven, when they are not flying kites. incidentally, this is kite flying like you have never seen kite flying. not only do the kids fly them, but they also compete with other kids to see who can cut the strings of another kid\\'s kite. the kite fighting flight scenes generate the same kind of excitement that the dog fighting scenes had in tony scott\\'s top gun. hassan is amir\\'s best friend but unlike amir, hassan belongs to the reviled hazara minority. earlier, young amir and hassan had a confrontation with young assef (elham ehsas) and his two flunkies. assef was about to beat them up, but hassan pulls out his slingshot and threatened to use it on assef. assef had no choice but to back down. meanwhile, amir was prepared to suffer the hand fate had dealt him. amir\\'s father baba laments his son\\'s lack of spine and fears that he will grow up half of a man because he is a coward, unlike the plucky little hassan who bails amir out of predicaments. anyway, amir and hassan emerge from the showdown with assef without a scratch. later, after amir sets a new record with his kite flying and fight skills, hassan runs after a kite to claim it. hassan is the eponymous character referred to in the title. hassan claims the fallen kite but he finds himself at the mercy of assef and his two minions. assef lets hassan kept the kite, but his minions pin hassan spread-eagle, belly down in an alley while assef sodomizes the youth. worst, a traumatized amir watches the assault from nearby but lacks the courage to intervene on behalf of his friend who would have intervened for him. aside from the extraordinary aerial scenes with the kites, the kite runner is down-to-earth, straight-forward stuff. when amir returns to afghanistan to rescue sohrab, he masquerades as a taliban fighter but he does not carry a firearm. the rescue scene in the kite runner is rather like the escape scene from the midnight express. while forster does not explore the local politics or plunge us into the ethnic and cultural issues at stake here. indeed, troy scenarist david benioff had to eliminate some parts of the book and the racial and ethnic prejudices are not clearly delineated so you have to accept some things on faith. forster lensed the film in nearly china to give it an authentic look. forster deserves credit for making this two hour plus epic fascinating. the performances, especially by the children, stand out for their believability. the kite runner is a film that you will not easily forget.',\n"," \"not a very good movie. van wilder 2:the rise of taj is a movie that almost completely relies on gross out

it\\'s not without trying... actually, it is. it\\'s a shamble all the more because it\\'s writer/director/technical everyman nick gaglia went through the same rehab cult that he depicts in the film. sometimes a first time filmmaker, full of the vigor that comes with getting a thumbs up or two from fellow film students, goes headlong into style that is way too disjointed, unsure, and dramatically frustrating that the personal side of the story, the extremely personal side, gets smudged in the purpose of telling a good story. gaglia, who was 13 when put into a horrid program that basically tortured and brainwashed their \"patients\" with crazy group scare tactics, psychological mind-f** sessions that could go on for days, and attitudes from the rehab leaders that would make most nazis cringe, escaped finally when he was 15. i am glad he got out, though it might help if he now goes into a real rehab for his film-making skills, if only for a couple of days, to learn things like, say, structure, proper lighting, fluid camera movement, subtlety with actors, and other basics that are perpetually lost here. it\\'s all the more frustrating because gaglia is dealing with a subject that should be shown more to the public (there was recently a newsweek article referring to a similar aa cult-rehab). many times one wonders if certain personal character studies might work better as documentaries as opposed to narrative dramas. this is an ever-nagging sensation throughout over the gw, where it almost feels like gaglia wants to tell the truth but does not know how to communicate it properly through his characters. the character that one would think is closest to him, bronx teen tony serra (gallagher), who is taken by his mother to a rehab in new jersey, would be closest to gaglia, is actually much more of a one-dimensional being, where there is very little back-story (we see a brief freak-out, in black and white, in his old home) and little connection to his mother (moriarty), who has more potential that is never tapped aside from a cold stone who passes her kids off to another. but there is a story to go with his two-year crisis, i guess. right off the bat things get rough (a nude cavity search in the first five minutes), and soon it\\'s clear that instead of medical care it\\'s more like a cross between anger management and some bizarre religious sect, where the head doctor hiller (insinnia) is a total over-controlling loon. but soon tony\\'s sister sofia (donohue) gets thrown in to the program, and as opposed to tony\\'s repeated moments of outrage and supposed non-compliance, she goes head-on through the whacked-out three step program and once released becoming a runaway. at times there are bits in this fractured nightmare, where there\\'s one woman, a 22 year old mother who has been in the program a year and a half finds she\\'s become a prisoner not allowed to leave, and when the father of the main siblings comes and pays an enraged visit to hiller when sofia finally returns to them, that do contain some raw power, very brief glimpses of gaglia being able to at least garner some leverage in pure melodrama. but these are moments few and far between. it\\'s not just the unsuccessful characters, who are mostly reduced to stereotypes that veer into being like hysterical d.a.r.e. rip-offs (maybe some of them, like an angry black youth, the passive-aggressive counselors, or even serra\\'s older sister who is ratted out by the siblings as having taken a hit off a joint and almost thrown into the program, would resonate more if there was more time given to develop any of them). it\\'s that gaglia is so unfocused in his multiple roles on his tiny $30,000 budget that not one side of whatever potential talent he has can come through. he over-uses tints, mostly with a shade that looks urine-coated), he jiggles his hand-held dvx camera as if it\\'s supposed to be intense ala city of god, occasionally a character will just shoot into frame randomly, his choices of music are like the worst selections possible from pseudo-indie soft-rockers, and there\\'s even inane fake interview scenes with nicholas serra (inspiration ?) and krakowsky that feel about as false as possible. could gaglia just not get any interviews with the real victims he was with and resort to would-be artistically cathartic plan b? bottom line, no matter

that preceded the television series. half of the running time is filled with flashbacks from the four previous movies. it gets old real quick. the actual battle with the minotaur is a disappointment as well. the costume worn by the actor playing the minotaur makes it all but impossible for him to move with any grace during the fight scenes. the relationship between hercules and iolaus, which would become one of the highlights of the television series, seems very unnatural. almost all of the dialogue is designed to set up the next flashback. - too bad, because this one has a lot of potential. the plot concerning the minotaur's secret is one of the best in the five movies. although the way it is handled makes it very obvious for anyone to guess.\",\n"," 'part of the dvd series \"the work of director __\", a trio of dvds featuring the work of three groundbreaking video and short film directors, \"the work of michel gondry\" is an extensive filmography of the director\\'s work prior to his acclaimed feature film debut \"eternal sunshine of the spotless mind\". it was interesting to see these pieces after having seen that film because it is so clear that his innovative and (usually) whimsical vision were present long before that film was released. essentially \"discovered\" by musician bjork and tapped to do the video for her film \"human behaviour\", gondry went on to do several videos for her as well as for the white stripes, the chemical brothers, foo fighters & the rolling stones, among others. all of the videos feature enormous amounts of color, are usually laden with fantasy elements (there are a lot of themes that involve time-shifting) and most either are ironic or dryly humorous. the total effect is completely intoxicating. i have always found bjork\\'s videos to be wonderful and unusual, but all of the videos in fair succession of one another are a heady experience. the amount of work that went into the white stripes\\' \"fell in love with a girl\" video, which features the band as legos, with every shot done manually is mind-boggling. even kylie minogue\\'s \"come into my world\" (i personally find her insipid at best) was extremely enjoyable because the video, essentially a mobius strip where minogue is walking around a city block, was so sublime. the collection also features some commercial work and short films that gondry has produced during his professional career including a beautifully shot black and white film called \"the letter\". having now seen all three of the collections released by the directors label series (including spike jonze and chris cunningham) gondry\\'s work is the perfect addition to the series because he brings an element of bright imagination, and while all three directors are creative, his work is laced with a fancifulness that works as a thin patina, under which obvious intelligence lies. i considered \"eternal sunshine of the spotless mind\" to be the best film released in 2004, and gondry\\'s video work is a strong support for his talent and vision. i highly recommend it. 8/10 --shelly',\n"," \"when you look at the title of this dvd you think its a live dvd. however you will be

some interesting extras like chester bennington's tattoos and what they represent and some audio only tracks like high voltage and my december. it also goes in great detail about the making of the in

4/10, which is probably higher than it deserves, simply for bela lugosi\\'s presence and reasonable (though not stellar) performance. the rest of the acting was okay. it starts off with a quite interesting premise-the narration by the spirit of the corpse on the slab. i had thought that it might lead to something interesting, but sadly the script and storyline seemed just thrown together and incoherent. strange things occur that were presumably frightening enough to cause the narrator\\'s death, but that just bore the audience. hardly worth seeing unless you are a bela lugosi completist,

worldly columnist for a cosmo-clone tries to drive this guy away by being wildly psychotic and bizarre, not what would actually make sense: unattractive and needy. and then when psycho and bizarre does not work, she ends up going to meet his folks on staten island. and suddenly the script writers seem to give up on trying to decide what she should be thinking and she just goes as herself, with no anxieties or anything. nor does he seem to notice this difference. actually the whole staten island sequence was excellent: funny, real, sweet, sincere... it just totally did not fit the rest of the movie. it's as if the writers came up with that really great scene and then tried to find a totally bland hollywood movie to stick it in, where it vaguely makes sense. it's hard not to let this

consider that woods' work at least had some naive charm about it. the acting was atrocious. every single actor in this movie seemed to mail it in at the same time, and it was not all due to the poor writing. finally, the cgi was extremely poorly done. there was no hint of realism at all with any of the computer work. the effects were cheap and lacked any sort of attention to detail, something the entire movie lacked as a whole. i have to be fair and say that like the previous reviewer, i only watched part of the movie. it turned out that the movie was dirty, and stopped playing after about 45

almost totally wordless. his eyes tell as much about the way he is feeling as any words can. the raw human emotions are amazing. watching sun-hwa go from the most innocent girl into the call girl that

cleanest energy around, the sun. i live in a loft, which is exposed to total sunlight on its roof the entire day. i hardly use the ac - i am sure it would consume too much electricity to convert the intense heat in the attic to about five degrees cooler. we are blessed with \"dry\" heat in this part of the country. i am from the gulf coast of the usa, so i know about humidity... that said, i found \"the china syndrome\" to be a convincing movie about what could go wrong, if the industry is not busy regulating and inspecting nuclear plants. i think there are enough comments posted here to enlighten those who still fear it like the plague: they are safe. tmi is still on-line... director james bridges carefully guides this plot (by mike gray-t s cook) to build suspense and to a thoughtfully interesting film. all the roles were well-played: jane fonda (\"kimberly wells\"), jack lemmon (jack godell\") and producer michael douglas (\"richard adams\") are all excellent in their roles, plus all of the rest of the cast. i, too, loved there being no score. it was so interesting to get a true-to-life glimpse of the behind-the-scenes of the tv industry - that should not be surprising. currently, dan rather is sue-ing cbs, and i hope he wins. can you believe donald trump saying \"he\\'s a loser\" ? trump - who cares? \"tiberius1234\" posted a very good comment here - i

on visuals alone, fellini\\'s satyricon would surely be completely off the scale: a phantasmagorical mixture of sensual beauty and the distasteful but evocative grotesque set in an ancient rome that never was, never could have been, and yet which plays up to every extreme concept we secretly harbor about roman decadence. the leading men are incredibly beautiful; the women are generally seductively depraved; and the broad vision that fellini offers is easily one of the visually stunning creations ever put to film. and yet, oddly, the film is sterile. the story is impossible to describe, a series of largely unrelated events in the lives of two impossibly handsome youths (martin potter and hiram keller) who begin the film by battling over the sexual favors of a slave boy (max born) who alternately unites and divides them until all three find themselves sold into slavery and flung from adventure to adventure, most often with sexual (and frequently homosexual) connotations. clearly, fellini is making a statement about the triviality and emptiness of a life lived for physical pleasures alone. but the film is jumpy, disjointed, disconnected; the sequences do not always arise from each other in any consistent way, leaving viewers with a sort of \"what the...\" reaction when the film unexpectedly shifts without explanation. (this is actually in keeping with the original ancient text, of which only portions remain.) in consequence, satyricon is ultimately less about any philosophical statement fellini may have had in mind than it is about sheer pictorial splendor and deliberate weirdness. whatever its failings, it is an astonishing film, and one that would have tremendous influence on a host of directors who followed in fellini\\'s wake--although all to often without his style and vision. clearly pasolini, director of such works as salo, arabian nights, and canterbury tales spent the better part of his largely unlamented life trying to out-fellini fellini; likewise, it is impossible to imagine how tinto brass and bob guccione arrived at the notorious caligula without reference to fellini\\'s satyricon. such efforts to expand on satyricon were merely more explicit and less interesting than the original, and i do not really recommend them--nor do i really recommend satyricon for any one other than fellini fans, for with its oddly disjointed feel it is unlikely to please those raised on mainstream. still, it is a powerful, remarkably beautiful, and completely unexpected film that must be seen at least once by any one with a serious interest in world cinema, and to those i recommend it without hesitation. gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer',\n"," 'this is the biography of famous actor lon

'redux' slapped on the end of the title i wonder what went wrong. i wonder why the film just did not work out at all. i wonder why the movie failed to score any major points in my book. in particular, what was it about the film which dragged it down, and made it the director's worst film of his career? well it's not too hard to figure out really. let me just say that it truly is a shame that kar-wai so abruptly went down this hell-hole of mediocrity and poorness in moviedom, especially considering the fact that in the same year he released chungking express, one of his enduring legacies and an absolutely sublime film. so what went wrong? it would be suitable to consider ashes of time as somewhat of an experimental film. our director essentially places his own inimitable style of film-making and places it in an entirely different setting, mood and atmosphere; what results is a catastrophic film which is all over the place and simply does not work out. hence, it would be even wiser to call ashes of time a failed experiment. bold, audacious and innovative, but a failure nonetheless. let me elaborate. those who have seen the films of mr. kar-wai, a hong kong-born film auteur who's made his mark on the art-house world since his debut in the late-80's, will know that there is an overriding aesthetic which binds all of his movies together; essentially and frankly speaking, they are all colourful, thought-provoking, amiable, subtly humorous and meaningful evocations of life, love and loss. the same formula is transposed into ashes of time; however, the regular setting of hong kong is ridden of, and in its stead we are placed into the setting of ancient china, and the land of the legendary martial arts warriors and clansmen. intertwined into this quasi-adventure/historical caper is the typical kar-wai love story, this time involving an elegiac hit-man who has moved to the middle of the desert, and is carrying out contract killings. however, i must stop myself there; description of characters is a useless thing to do. why? because not a single character in ashes of time is worth mentioning or nothing. what a bland cast, and what a waste of talent (the case of ashes of time contains nearly all regular kar-wai collaborators). not only that, but the film is essentially endless incessant rambling in a horrendous, almost non-existent narrative structure. one of the main reasons why detractors of ashes of time berate it is because it seems to possess no plot whatsoever, let alone a semblance or an indication of one. you can definitely see what they are getting at, even from the first two, three minutes, maybe less, of the film. perhaps it's just the atypical setting of ancient china which is unaccustomed and inappropriate for kar-wai's typical film-making style. i like to think, however unfortunate it may be, that mr. kar-wai just stuffed up big time here. one thing that a reviewer can actually compliment in ashes of time, albeit said compliment being starkly isolated, is another director trademark wonderful, colourful and blissful aesthetics. what joyous colour is composed on-screen, what glorious textures are painted for us, and what breathtaking landscapes and imagery are captured for us throughout the entire movie. we can at least take this as a sign that wong kar-wai is still there at heart, and it's just the film which is so atypical, and buries his usually commendable nuance. although the visuals are not enough for us to fully absolve kar-wai for this disastrous venture, they are enough to make the film worthwhile and at least we do not walk out of the movie in a completely and totally cantankerous mood, now that there's something we can think of nicely. the film is essentially a 'wuxia art' film, following in the style of, say, legendary japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa. however, one thing differentiates kar-wai's film from kurosawa's best, and that's that in the japanese director's films everything gels together and simply works. in ashes of time, nothing seems to work. kar-wai's attempt to make a genuinely profound wuxia film, let alone an intellectual and provocative movie in general terms, is a futile endeavour. kar-wai claims that making ashes of time exhausted him, and that he needed time to clear his head. it must have certainly been a fatiguing effort on his behalf, as his exertions are embodied in the film and transferred to us directly i mean, just watching the film is an exhausting effort, and now i need time to clear my head of this unpleasant movie-going experience.\",\n"," 'the gist of my too-long ramble below is there probably is, at least definitively within the film, no answer to the \"why?\" of matteo, and that nicola as he ages increasingly embraces the status quo. blame inevitable age, if you like, but it does not happen to their mother. way back, among some finished and unfinished novels that migrate to each computer i buy but that otherwise i no longer bring myself to look at, is one in which my myshkin-like protagonist lies up a minor tragedy to cause his various acquaintances who have nothing to do with one another to show up at one place at the same time. the russian myshkin could not lie, of course, but mine did. just to see, i guess: a sort of wish-fulfillment, curiosity that killed the cat or made the student\\'s mind viable or kept the oldster\\'s young and nimble. lying is storytelling is lying. the act of writing allows, or allowed, me, playing god just like that character of mine, to introduce to one another versions of people i known but whose paths never crossed otherwise. a tragic, now late, slow guy from work somehow occupies my vacation-vacant condo and hits it off with my garrulous but uneducated father. that kind of thing. or, as myshkin, i grab one or another misplaced acquaintance, long gone well before my mountaineering days, and march her way above the timberline to some icy col only to play at not knowing the way back down while sweet panic and thunderheads well. i do not want to get into most la meglio gioventù\\'s maybe merits, the pacing and rhythms gained by extraordinary length, the credible aging and acquisition of time\\'s wisdom, whether for growth or stagnation, in most the characters, the relatively quiet interpolation of passing history. but the sadly heavy-handed, grossly unnecessary insertion of matteo\\'s \"ghost\" into the closing scene between nicola and mirella made me realize what an orgy of wish-fulfillment the second half is. suddenly, seemingly because life or time heals but maybe just so the filmmaker could resolve things for us, nearly everyone meets everyone. even at six hours, a story\\'s tick needs its tock. whether or not director giordana and his writers intended the nearly dead center division, part one ticks, and then part two tocks. if this is more than just a really, really good soap opera, then there have to be ambiguity, loose ends, disappointments that come more from life\\'s constraints than from audiences\\' need for reassurance and resolution. why, other than to create suspense, does nicola deny giorgia\\'s need be involved in finding mirella? he\\'s suddenly so uncharacteristically lacking in empathy. if he\\'s hurting over matteo, then he\\'s selfish. if he\\'s just being professional, then we are denied his rationale. i can easily dream up justifications within nicola\\'s character, but, watching, i sensed a filmmaker struggling to twist an ending out of events that in reality must fractal along indefinitely. with possible exceptions of nicola\\'s mother and perhaps his too-young-yet, barely formed though marriageable, daughter, mirella seems the sanest creature in the film, fate\\'s gift to this at least slightly askew family. has nicola even told her about giorgia, and in what terms? inevitably she will meet giorgia (tiny piece of a six-hour sequel?!), but the film denies us the experience. matteo\\'s so ever-present, and all the more so as the film progresses, in no small part because of giorgia\\'s obsession, that that bit of magic realism offended me as a viewer. do not plaster on the screen what\\'s already there: do not double images. besides, i am not at all certain the living matteo would have been so generous. the sequence suggests suicide\\'s a path to peace of mind, a return to balance or to freedom from self (what?! does matteo reach enlightenment? aurrgh!), but no one can know this. are the filmmakers saying that matteo by self-abnegation, self-destruction, restored balance to his family? probably not, but how cruel the suggestion! even so matteo\\'s the glue here, the macguffin, a key of some sort. i have sat through enough director q & as to suspect there may be no explanation. ambiguity\\'s a storyteller\\'s tool. ambiguity, red herrings, in stories not by genre mysteries cue ineptness from hacks, but deliberation from pros. matteo\\'s case abounds in red herrings. despite the transvestite, i do not think he\\'s gay (all i saw in the episode was self-loathing, and nowadays they would have simply told us so; the day he first flirts with mirella, despite his holding back, he seems no less enthralled than nicola will be later). despite the cop stuff, the look, the gun, i do not think he\\'s political (they could have involved him against nicola\\'s terrorist love but do not; nicola though, by surviving so wholeheartedly within the status quo does come off political). surely each of us, as i think the filmmakers intend, will find a different key to matteo. empson, writing about ambiguity, usually says not that one or another reading is \"it,\" but that all are present and in play. matteo\\'s mystery allows the filmmakers\\' artifice to breathe. if i see any clue, it lies way back, the day or two with giorgia, when she, if not he, knew him already a soul broken in some way that her experience had taught her to understand. whatever was wrong with him likely was already wrong then. i do not know what it was, but banishing from the film\\'s close the first and only character who \"got it\" seems to doom the whole family, if only in the sense of their not \"getting it\" about matteo and giorgia. it seriously undercuts that silly ghost-matteo scene. i know too little to speak but recall vaguely that there may be a genetic tendency to suicide: sort of a no-fault clause. luigi lo cascio as nicola, incidentally, looks like both jean-pierre léaud and dustin hoffman, but, even saying that, i can not see that those two ever behave quite alike.',\n"," \"just watched this one again. i wanted to show it to one of my friends and we had the best time. this is why these kind of movies are made, to entertain people and zombie bloodbath 2 does that for me and for everyone i have showed it to. the story concerns a group of teenagers in a van that run into a group of escaped convicts who have taken over an old farmhouse. when a scarecrow (that is actually a demon i think) gets disturbed, it comes to life and re-animates dead bodies from the local cemeteries. this leads our heroes to escape only to land in the arms of two insane killers that are in the process of torturing some people in a deli in a small town. pretty soon it's a showdown with humans fighting zombies. i loved this movie! from it's different formats (black and white film, video and digital cameras) to the very fast pace and great music, there was always something going on and it never bores you! sure, it's cheap, but you can tell that a great deal of care and hard work went into this film. i have read other reviews and all i can say is that these people have missed the point. if you want 35mm full moon fluff, or if you are into modern stuff like urban legend, then i say pass on this. if you like low budget stuff like gates of hell and evil dead, i say buy this now. the make-up and gore is very good, the acting is uneven at times, but over-all it is pretty good and the editing is very impressive. there is enough going on in this one to fill two more films! it is actually one of the better b-movies i have seen in ages.\",\n"," 'now, throw momma from the train was not a great comedy, but it is a load of fun and makes you laugh. the title may seem a little strange, but the

funny events take place. the premise is quite funny, and the things that billy crystal and danny de vito get into were great. some of the scenes seemed to not fit in for me, but this did not make it a bad movie. for what it is, a wacky comedy, it pulls it off well and should be seen once just to say you saw it.',\n"," 'a movie about a woman who starts fires as she becomes aroused.. this movie will

millennium cross-hybrid between on golden pond and the prince of tides, this film ends up being an erratic mess shifting so mercurially between comedy and melodrama that the emotional pitch always seems off. the main problem seems to be the irreconcilable difference between garry marshall's sentimental direction and mark andrus' dark, rather confusing screenplay. the story focuses on the unraveling relationship between mother lilly and daughter rachel, who have driven all the way from san francisco to small-town hull, idaho where grandmother georgia lives. the idea is for lilly to leave rachel for the summer under georgia's taskmaster jurisdiction replete with her draconian rules since the young 17-year old has become an incorrigible hellion. the set-up is clear enough, but the characters are made to shift quickly and often inexplicably between sympathetic and shrill to fit the contrived contours of the storyline. it veers haphazardly through issues of alcoholism, child molestation and dysfunctional families until it settles into its pat resolution. the three actresses at the center redeem some of the dramatic convolutions but to varying degrees. probably due to her off-screen reputation and her scratchy smoker's voice, lindsay lohan makes rachel's promiscuity and manipulative tactics palpable, although she becomes less credible as her character reveals the psychological wounds that give a reason for her hedonistic behavior. felicity huffman is forced to play lilly on two strident notes - as a petulant, resentful daughter to a mother who never got close to her and as an angry, alcoholic mother who starts to recognize her own accountability in her daughter's state of mind. she does what she can with the role on both fronts, but her efforts never add up to a flesh-and-blood human being. at close to seventy, jane fonda looks great, even as weather-beaten as she is here, and has the star presence to get away with the cartoon-like dimensions of the flinty georgia. the problem i have with fonda's casting is that the legendary actress deserves far more than a series of one-liners and maternal stares. between this and 2005's execrable monster-in-law, it does make one wonder if her best work is behind her. it should come as no surprise that the actresses' male counterparts are completely overshadowed. garrett hedlund looks a little too surfer-dude as the naïve harlan, a devout mormon whose sudden love for rachel could delay his two-year missionary stint. cary elwes plays on a familiar suspicious note as lilly's husband, an unfortunate case where predictable casting appears to telegraph the movie's ending. there is also the omnipresent dermot mulroney in the morose triple-play role of the wounded widower, lilly's former flame and rachel's new boss as town veterinarian dr. simon ward. laurie metcalf has a barely-there role as simon's sister paula, while marshall regular hector elizondo and songsmith paul williams show up in cameos. some of andrus' dialogue is plain awful and the wavering seriocomic tone never settles on anything that feels right. there are several small extras with the 2007 dvd, none all too exciting. marshall provides a commentary track that has plenty of his trademark laconic humor. there are several deleted scenes, including three variations on the ending, and a gag reel. a seven-minute making-of featurette is included, as well as the original theatrical trailer, a six-minute short spotlighting the three actresses and a five-minute tribute to marshall.\",\n"," \"one of

already fabulous career,and malchovich's best role to date!\",\n"," 'i read the book after seeing the movie and did not care for it, finding it somewhat trashy; but trashy books often make good movies, and this one certainly could have. the story of a teen girl\\'s exploration of her attractive power over boys, which she finds as irresistibly stimulating as it is doubtfully controllable, and which has an even tighter grip on her than it would on a normal girl because it affects her through her werewolfry--this story would have an obvious appeal to the young audience for which movies are made: an appeal of one kind to girls, and of another kind to boys: and i do not understand how the movie makers could be blind to that and turn the story into one with little appeal to anybody. to begin with, take the title (which is the best thing about the book): it\\'s drawn from a hesse quotation, also used as an epigraph, about a person running in fear and tasting both blood and chocolate in his mouth, one tasting as bad as the other. this is a wonderful metaphor for the heroine\\'s state: torn between her human and wolf sides, savoring each but equally fearful of both. the movie dispenses with the epigraph, and instead introduces the character working in her aunt\\'s chocolate shop! i can understand how the book\\'s title might have suggested to the movie makers the erotically charged chocolates of \"like water for chocolate,\" and led them to want to link the same symbol to werewolves. but they did not; so why is it in the movie? in the book the characters are in high school--or in and out, as with the five, a teen gang who favor black jeans and t-shirts, and fall somewhere between being the heroine\\'s nemeses and her pet peeves. in the movie they have become decadent twenty-something clubgoers. in the book the heroine is 16, just of an age to be discovering how her sexuality operates on the boy she wants, as well as on herself; she\\'s the one who initiates the contact, then steps back, re-initiates, and so on. in the movie she\\'s no longer a girl but a woman, and the guy is no longer a high school poet on the fringe of campus life but a fugitive from the law (and a comic book artist, to boot), it\\'s he who comes on to her, in a manner as unattractive as that of her wormy cousin. she initially puts him off, but then gives in, as he\\'s confident she will: hey, you know you want it. i would have thought a female director would have taken the chance the book offered to show a female protagonist in an uncompliant, proactive role; but no. in the book the heroine\\'s clan is driven from their home because of the five\\'s delinquent behavior; in the movie it\\'s because she went for a run(!). she\\'s a great runner, prone to kicking off from building walls, and both she and her clanmates scale buildings in a trice; very like heroes of martial arts movies and very unlike wolves, or anything resembling them. in the book they do not turn into actual wolves, but things bigger than wolves; in the movie they are just ordinary wolves. in the book they metamorphose in \"howling\" style, with crunching of spines; this is one of the things that make the heroine aware of the pain her body brings her, as well as the pleasure. in the movie the werewolves have become magical acrobats, taking great swan dives and transforming in mid-air, shimmering yellow like tinker-bell; it looks cool, means nothing. in the book the clan is a slightly white-trashy family that has relocated from west virginia to maryland. in the movie they live in bucharest but all talk in different accents, none romanian. in the book nearly the whole pack want to lead normal lives and agree that to insure that--and indeed, their survival--one necessity is to keep their true nature secret from humans. and so the characters keep saying in the movie; yet the head of the clan is some kind of underground boss--but apparently not a crime boss, since he despises criminals--and has a standing deal with the police, who supply him with \"meat\" for the pack. this seems a big exception to the rule of keeping humans from knowing; but maybe the police are considered safe because of their known tolerance for eccentricity and cult murder. at the end of the book the heroine learns she can not be something she\\'s not when, in her effort to live a divided life, she gets stuck between the human and animal states, unable to be all one thing or the other. her boyfriend is not sure or strong enough to accept her for what she is, the pack can not risk having him around, and the two are forced to separate. in the movie she rescues him like lassie, and they drive off to paris (why paris?), in an ending that\\'s smiley-faced but not really happy, since the conflicts between their natures--between _her_ natures--remain unresolved. but the difference in the movie that hampers enjoyment the most is that whereas the book characters behave conventionally, within the realm of young adult novels, those in the movie for some reason have been made as annoying as possible. every other line is a threat or some other kind of oneupsmanship: you\\'ll be sorry; you do not belong here; you will not get rid of me; i gave you your chance; etc. i prefer to steer clear of people who deal in that way. there have been many good vampire movies, never a good werewolf movie. had this one stuck to the book, it might have been the first. but no.',\n"," 'i watched this video because i like malta and this movie was filmed in its entirety there. very disappointing, since it fails to catch any of the flavor or beauty of the island - just the hot, dry, and barren elements. the movie was dull, boring, completely incoherent from

short, i\\'d much rather endure another colonoscophy before viewing this horrible mess again. it was so bad, i actually could not fall asleep. there are quite a few \"eurotrash\" movies out there that were obviously made without adult supervision. this is one of them. on the bright side, who is nadia cassini? never before have i seen a more beautiful set of legs. she is the one saving grace of this

etc.) and then set upon by dogs before it was shot. oh, well - go visit malta anyway despite this film - it\\'s a beautiful, colorful island; rich in history and lots of fun.',\n"," 'by the mid 1990s, the career of animator-director don bluth had seemed to drop to its all-time low. before, bluth had made a series of popular animated films, many which remain beloved today such as \"the land before time\" (1988), \"the secret of nimh\" (1982), and \"an american tail\" (1986). but beginning with \"thumbelina\" in 1994, his films seemed to decrease more and more in quality and popularity and one of the many unfortunate entries is 1995\\'s box office bomb \"the pebble and the penguin\", a film that did not attract audience members beyond parents and children under the age of seven. frankly, the latter are the only audience members i can comprehend taking enjoyment out of this rather bland animated feature. the story is absurd. the film stars a poorly-drawn, stammering, and chubby penguin named hubie (voiced by martin short) who falls in love with a female penguin with a surprisingly healthy flower on her head (voice by annie golden). sort of like in real life, penguins present their bride-to-bes with a pebble as a substitute for a ring. but when hubie is swept away by the current, he teams up with a lone rockhopper (james belushi) with a dream of flying and they race against time to return to antarctica before it\\'s too late. the reasons why they could be too late is one of many underdeveloped elements of this weak story that would still be weak even if they were there. it becomes very clear very early on why this animated children\\'s musical does not and will not work for anybody older than say six or seven years of age. it just does not have any of the qualities that are required for a good animated feature. number one, the film looks bad on account of a very poor drawing style. the animation in this film is very cartoony (even as far as animated films go); it\\'s dark, gloomy, there is no vibrancy in the colors, and on top of that, the design of the film and the elements in it are universally droll and laughable. take for instance, the penguins who star in the film. with only a few background exceptions, every single penguin looks absolutely nothing at all like a bird. hubie, for example, looks absurdly ridiculous with wide cheeks, a stubby beak, big eyes, and that preposterous hat that he wears wherever he goes. combined with his hand-like \"flippers\" he looks like chris farley in a penguin suit. result: he\\'s an ugly, poorly-drawn cartoon character. but the most absurd-looking and absurdly-designed character is the evil penguin, drake, who frankly looks nothing at all like a penguin. he\\'s a muscle-man wearing a penguin mask. he\\'s got a chest broader than that of arnold schwarzenegger, and teeth larger than the teeth of the leopard seals and killer whales that serve as the film\\'s predators. basically, he\\'s a two-dimensional, recycled villain. he lives in a cave shaped like a skull, he wears a cape, laughs a lot, and gets mad when people laugh with him. result: who cares? and what\\'s also bad, and maybe worse, is that this is an animated musical and there\\'s not a single noteworthy or memorable song to found anywhere within its running time. the opening hymn was harmlessnot memorable, but harmless. but after that, the songs became duller and duller and there was one in particular that had me grimacing all the way through. it\\'s the moment that viewers press the fast-forward button for whenever it comes up. i felt \"the pebble and the penguin\" was lame all around save for the very few moments when hubie and the rockhopper penguin rocko are placed in peril at the jaws of leopard seals and killer whales, who were thankfully, given no dialogue and treated as animals instead of cartoon characters. but in a way, for this reason, i cannot wholeheartedly recommend this movie to children. this is the reason. the film displays killer whales are the natural predator of the penguins. my concern is that children familiar with \"free willy\" (1993) may be offended or downhearted by seeing their favorite denizen of the sea portrayed as a bloodthirsty carnivore. the leopard seal was a better antagonist and was more funny seeing as how his jaws opened wider than a rattlesnake\\'s and how he appeared to smile while growling. but the point really is, these moments with the predatorsand there are only a feware the only interesting moments. and they are not enormously interesting, mind you. bottom line, i cannot recommend this to anybody below the age of seven. my advice: if you have children around that page, rent it for them. they might enjoy it.',\n"," 'louis calhern is superb as oliver wendell holmes. the

which point harlan goes looking for some revenge... photographed & directed by don e. fauntleroy one has to say that the shot in eastern europe straight-to-video action films that steven seagal specialises in these days are not getting any better & today you die is a good case in point. this is a terrible film, simple as that really. the script by producer danny lerner, kevin moore & les weldon gives seagal a new sort of character to get his none existent acting skills around, that of a criminal rather than some government agent/cop/soldier/one man army cliché he usually plays. in fact if you were being charitable you could say today you die is a rip-off of mel gibson's excellent thriller payback (1998) where he too played a really nasty piece of work to such good effect. while payback was a superb uncompromising hard edged film noir type action thriller today you die is not & pales into insignificance by comparison. unfortunately here seagal is terrible, he has no on screen presence or menace either & the audience is never quite sure whether he is meant to be a bad guy that we hate or not. for instance initially his character's is set up like a modern day robin hood as he steals from the rich drug dealers & scumbags to give to the poor (as well as keeping a tidy profit for himself) which is just ludicrous in itself but then it has seagal turn around & murder a lot of people which contradicts the likable criminal with morals that the film went to such lengths to set up in the first place. the story is full of holes, for instance agent knowles is contacted by the on the run harlan & is then reprimanded by her bent superior for meeting him & it turns out that he found out by tapped her phone. in that case why did not her boss use the information he had to catch harlan? the story is the usual dull predictable bland fight over lots of money with surprise surprise the investigating government agent is actually a bad guy! wow, i did not see that coming i must say... director fauntleroy slows everything down to a snails pace & today you die feels like it goes on forever, the action scenes & set-pieces are also severely lacking in entertainment value. the infrequent fight scenes are not great, most are either shot in shadow, very quickly cut & edited or with the camera played behind seagal's character to try & disguise the fact that most of the stunt work done here is by a double. again seagal looks fat & out of shape & uses long baggy overcoats to try & hide it, it does not. there's a pretty cool car chase through the streets of las vegas in this at the start & i thought that today you die might be alright but it seems the whole sequence was stolen from another action film called top of the world (1997) which is about a las vegas casino robbery, as well as using footage from that film today you die also edits scenes from the charlie sheen action film no code of conduct (1998), the jean-claude van damme action film the order (2001) & the wesley snipes prison based action film undisputed (2002) so quite how much of today you die is original footage is anyone's guess. technically the film is alright, considering it's edited together from four separate films as well as it's own footage it's just about competent & consistent enough. all the footage of the us locations are obviously lifted from the films already mentioned with all the original footage shot on the cheap in bulgaria. the rap style music that litter today you die is awful by the way. the acting is poor & seagal just mumbles his way through his lines as usual. today you die is a really bad film made up from other bad action films, seagal looks old & fat, the action scenes are average at best & most of the story is fairly random & it does not come together

gal who had to brush the sagebrush pollen out of her hair before joining polite company, stow her lasso, and pretend to be civilised, how did she manage to master the accent and rhythms and patterns of speech, dress, and mannerisms of those real savages, the gals in those short tart's skirts who live in tower blocks in east london and are married to men who support arsenal football club? (ugh! football! makes me sick! and singing about a football club, how oafish can you get?) it all goes to show that williams, like good wine, travels well, even though in this case it was from planet to planet. this film is so brilliantly written and directed by sharon maguire (formerly a television documentary film maker) that the combination of maguire and williams sets the cinema on fire and thereby justifies the film's title admirably. excellent support is had from ewan mcgregor and matthew macfadyen as the two male leads, but all eyes are on williams. the production values of this film are very high, and it is easy to be convinced that the big terrorist attack on wembley stadium has really happened, as the attack and the aftermath are all so real. however, this is not a film about terrorism, which is merely the backdrop, in the sense that world wars and civil wars have been for so many films in the past, from gone with the wind to for whom the bell tolls to mrs. miniver. this is a film about people, but especially about michelle williams. only a woman could have directed this. in fact, one is tempted to say that all films with terrorism backgrounds should be directed by women, because they are not tempted as men are to dwell on all the violence for its own sake. with a woman at the helm, this film becomes a people film, but a man would have strayed, taken more interest in guns and corpses and explosions (little boys going bang bang sometimes never grow up, especially when they have a budget and a cameraman handed to them). as a study of searing grief and despair, williams has our hearts in her mouth, but do not worry, it is not really a downer, it is simply so spellbinding looking at her and seeing into another dimension. she seems to be a tiny little thing, and it is almost inconceivable that such a small package can carry such a huge explosive power. this film really is an instant contemporary classic.\",\n"," \"mulholland drive made me the definitive fan of david lynch. he's a modern genius, because he's not only a film-maker. his stories and his style have a spell that cross the screen. so the straight story was quite a surprise to me, with its easy to follow storyline and sunny sets. still, lynch is there, and, while this is far from his best, it's a film not to be missed. late richard farnsworth's performance is one of the reasons. 8/10\",\n"," \"this is another boring low budget horror/monster movie. the video box art is quite cool (as usual) but the film itself is far too dull. the monster is a guy in a rubber suit, which usually would give you laughs due to the cheese factor, but sadly the monster is not shown nearly enough to be entertaining. there's no gore nor suspense to be had either. the acting ranges from ok to terrible. demon of paradise reminds me of another horror flick in a similar vein called the evil below, which is equally as boring. all horror fans will want to avoid both of these films - all they are good for are the vhs covers.\",\n"," 'the film lacks style, i mean original style. everything looks copied including action, first appearances in the movie, songs, dialog delivery, etc etc. yes, there the goof-ups were original, like in the beginning a car is shown with number up** number and few seconds later it starts falling down a hill with number mh**. that was one in many goof-ups of the movie :) anything good in the movie? yes, for kareena fans, if there are any, kareena in bikini. for akshay fans, his dialogs and action stunts. thats it. nothing else. so watch it on your own risk and do not blame the director or actors. director is already insane and actors, i pity them.',\n"," \"a difficult film to assess. the cinematography is stunning--one of the most beautifully shot and constructed urban thrillers i have seen from any country. visually it surpasses most american productions in its lushness and moments of brutality. in terms of atmosphere, it's unforgettable; the character in the rain, in the shadows of alleyways, the iridescent shimmering interiors (shot in some beautifully seedy spanish settings). a wonderful star-turn by victoria abril also carries the film. her character, who cruises for sex in public places, is in turns pathetic and fascinating and drives the film forward even when the plotlines lag. without blowing the revelation of the film, this also proves to be one of the most virulently aids- and homo-phobic stories committed to film. the film's positing of a gay character as a crux of the mystery and the final moments of the story leans on a highly questionable exploitation of audience prejudices and anxieties. taken at face value, it's an entertaining, well-paced thriller. behind the surfaces, though, it's reactionary trash which preys on hatred and misunderstanding of sexual minorities. the audience i saw this film with applauded at the end, for the bravura filmmaking and good acting. i left with a bad taste in my mouth and ashamed that i had enjoyed the majority of the film until the last few minutes. depending on where you are coming from and how far you are willing to scrutinize the context of this film, it will seem like a good, well-made movie or typically hetero-centric bashing of gay people, so common in movies from any country. or perhaps both?\",\n"," 'this is simply the epitome of what a made for tv

implausability. i realize that you need to create difficult situations which would cause suspense and the tense feeling of whats going to happen next, but this movie was so predictable, and is just not believable. i find that the more i watch this kind of movie, the more i am continually saying things to actors to direct them away from danger. continually making bad decisions just borders on being plain stupid. if they took the time to make it more realistic, i might have enjoyed it a little. having said that, you might be better off staying away from this one.',\n"," \"jean-jacques' career began with his essay answer to a prize question: civilization makes us evil. this intelligent and exciting movie supports that argument. in that sense it repeats a theme common to french films:

well hold true in france; at any rate, it's quite romantic.\",\n"," \"this was bad. really bad. extremely bad. let's start with the most important element of any movie: the plot. or actually, the lack

were quite good, for a b-movie. do not really have to complain about those (except perhaps the use, which they do not have) the actors. this movie was poorly acted, the characters stayed as flat as can be. but hey, there was no room for character development, they had to move the 'story' along! the overall feel. if you watch the first three minutes and feel like pushing the 'stop'-button, do it.

look is just right. the music is elegant and the costumes certainly deserved the oscar it received. regarding the murderer, it is impossible to really know who it may be. everyone could have done it

locations represent the small world in which these young people's lives intersect, in how they dole out their verbiage, how much belonging to a small group of people can dictate the every day thoughts of each member of the gang. the kids have not yet lived enough to be fully forming the opinions they insist upon shoving down each others throats, and the comedy comes from their own inexperience and total lack of thinking other wise. this is like a high brow breakfast club, smarter and much more fun for those of us not into stereotype titillation. with out a doubt on of my favorites.\",\n"," '\\'the dead next door\\' is an ode to all things zombie. a homage to sam raimi, tom savini and the great zombie-king george romero; done on a next to nothing budget. shot entirely on super-8, and written, produced, edited and scored by j.r. bookwalter; this thing looks and feels just like one would expect it to: indie. i found the storyline to be about as entertaining as it could be. zombies running amuck. scientists trying to cure them by running tests (much like romero\\'s \\'day of the dead\\'), which end up being fruitless. nice little original twist here too, a \"zombie squad\" who hunts down and kills them as in most zombie films, but this time they are roadblocked by a group of what appear to be leftist democrats trying to preserve the human rights of zombies. haha. not too far fetched in this day and age. anyhow, this leads the zombie squad to a farmhouse outside of akron ohio, where an original group of doctors almost perfected a serum which could get rid of the problem once and for all, problem is now that farmhouse is inhabited by a cult of zombie worshipers, led by a rev. jones, no doubt a tongue-in-cheek dark homage to the madman jim jones of jonestown fame. so it is what it is. a low-budget, ultra cheesy, terribly acted zombie gore-fest. by my standards of gore - my standards being jackson\\'s \\'braindead\\' as the godfather of gore for a zombie flick; \\'the dead next door\\' is slightly below average, but still having enough squirting blood and decapitations to keep me happy. enjoy this film with some mates and a few pints. 4 out of

started with lex luger, a former nwa world heavyweight champion being given a title shot against yokozuna. lex travelled all over the us in a bus called the lex express to inspire americans into rallying behind him in his bid to beat the japanese monster (who was actually samoan) and get the wwe championship back into american hands. as such there was much anticipation for this match. but every good ppv needs an undercard and this had some good stuff. the night started off with razor ramon defeating ted dibiase in a good match. the story going into this was that dibiase had picked on ramon and even offered him a job as a slave after his shock loss to the 1-2-3 kid on raw in july. ramon, angry, had then teamed with the 1-2-3 kid against the money inc tag team of ted dibiase and irwin r shyster. to settle their differences they were both given one on one matches dibiase vs ramon and shyster vs the kid. razor was able to settle his side of the deal after hitting a razor\\'s edge. next up came the steiner brothers putting the wwe tag team titles on the line against the heavenly bodies. depsite the interference of \"the bodies\" manager jim cornette, who hit scott steiner in the throat with a tennis racket, they were able to pull out the win in a decent match. shawn michaels and mr perfect had been feuding since wrestlemania ix when shawn michaels confronted perfect after his loss to lex luger. perfect had then cost michaels the intercontinental championship when he distracted him in a title match against marty janetty. michaels had won the title back and was putting it on the line against mr perfect, but michaels now had a powerful ally in his corner in his 7 foot bodyguard diesel. micheals and perfect had an excellent match here, but it was diesel who proved the difference maker, pulling perfect out of the ring and throwing him into the steel steps for shawn to win by count out. irwin r shyster avenged the loss of his tag team partner earlier in the night, easily accounting for the 1-2-3 kid. next came one of the big matches of the night as bret hart prepared to battle jerry lawler for the title of undisputed king of the wwe. but lawler came out with crutches, saying he\\'d been injured in a car accident earlier that day and that he\\'d arranged another opponent for hart: doink the clown. hart and doink had a passable match which hart won with a sharpshooter. he was then jumped from behind by lawler. this bought wwe president jack tunney to the ring who told lawler that he would receive a lifetime ban if he did not wrestle hart. hart then destroyed lawler, winning with the sharpshooter, but hart refused to let go of the hold and the referee reversed his decision. so after all that lawler was named the undisputed king of the wwe. this match was followed by ludvig borda destroying marty janetty in a short match. the undertaker finished his long rivalry with harvey wippleman, which had started in 1992 when the undertaker had defeated wippleman\\'s client kamala at summerslam and continued when wippleman\\'s latest monster the giant gonzales had destroyed taker at the rumble and then again at wrestlemania, with a decisive victory over gonzales here. gonzales then turned on wippleman, chokeslamming him after a poor match. next it was time for six man tag action as the smoking gunns (bart and billy) and tatanka defeated the headshrinkers (samu and fatu) and bam bam bigelow with tatanka pinning samu. this brings us to the main event with yokozuna, flanked by jim cornette and mr fuji, putting the wwe title on the line against lex luger and it was all on board the lex express. lex came out attacking, but yokozuna took control. lex came back though as he was able to avoid a banzai drop and then body slam yokozuna before knocking him out of the ring. luger then attacked cornette and fuji as yokozuna was counted out. luger had won a fine match! balloons fell from the ceiling. the heroes all came out to congratulate him on his win. yokozuna may have retained the title, but luger had proved he could be beaten. the only question was, who could beat him in the ring and get that title off him?',\n","

ability to shock people. it\\'s a childish impulse at heart, but great when you are deconstructing philosophies. in satirical cases, the childish impulse is justified by the purpose of the deconstruction. the need to expose the hypocrisy is much more than the jollies of the person doing the ripping. unfortunately for lee, satire requires a deft touch. being too coy and the satire fails as a justification for the subject of the satire in the first place. being too blunt and the satire comes off as preachy and self-serving. lee and his work fall into the latter; he does not have the touch to do effective satire because he is too close to the subject matter. lee has some valuable insight into matters of race (in that he never fails to remind us) and we take him at his word. sadly, he is so bitterly one-sided that his preaching. given his lust to bash all sides as a battle between him and the world, his movies often come off as diatribes that are disconnected from reality. the power of cinema is to put a person in a differing standpoint through prospective, and lee does not grasp that. to him, it\\'s a bigger stage for his ego and himself and we are \\'fortunate\\' enough to pay only a meager fee to finance his house to hear this great oracle of the nike commercials speak his wisdom.. which is about as intelligent as a thirteen-year old goth girl talking about death and cutting herself. the racial politics behind drop squad are so pathetic--rich equals white and poor equals black--is that it makes a mockery out of lee\\'s mlk love. lee never really grasps the idea of racism has a solid element of class-ism behind it. if you are black, you are poor yet humble. if you are white, you are rich and morally bankrupt. and if you are black and rich, then you are white and need to be knocked back down into being black. and with this, lee\\'s world of racism is complete according to this movie. and that idea is so self-hating and overly simplified that it defies logic. are we watching an examination of race relations, or are we watching a poor little rich boy deal with his unresolved racial/class issues by endorsing the same idea of crab theory--see \"the corner\" for more on this in a much more mature way then lee could ever imagine or wants to--that tortured him as he was growing up? in fact, why does not lee grow up and make movies a bit more textured instead of playing the game he was forced to as he was growing up? in short, lee\\'s \"do the right thing\" was the alpha and omega of his career. he would never show the same maturity or grow above it ever again. in a sense, he sold out himself, and the world is lesser for it.',\n"," 'it has been one whole year since the capers in home alone! and america\\'s favorite family is back

of the movie is 9. there are 8 people (except the police) in the examination room. mom 1, stationer 2, american man 3, greengrocer 4, ex-fiancée 5, photo firuz 6, tunç 7, kaya 8, ? 9. who is the 9th person? where did the necklace (of yiddish symbol)come from? why did they (the police) stop recording before they beat and torture kaya and made him confess the crime and sign ? if we do not answer these, we can not find the killer. remember the words of firuz: \" if you want, all things could have lived in a different manner.\" tunç prefer to confess (or do) the crime because he did not want his nationalist (and praised) dad (the butcher) have known he had f*cked firuz. firuz (who possibly knew the real killer) prefer to agree the accusation of murder because he want that nobody have known his homosexuality (and his love to kaya)so he made up a different story about the murder with the police along the movie (and the reason of the pain he felt while he was sitting on his ass is not his regret!) and he tried to save kaya from accusations while he was doing that. salim the stationer (who possibly knew the real killer) panicked and told a lot of things because he tried to save kaya (because he is his real father). american is an \"other\" and all neighborhood could accuse him for this crime. american and salim are afraid of the reactions of the neighborhood (because one of them is an ex-communist and a cheater while other one is a foreigner) and they are easily persuaded to hide somethings for the possibility to continue their lives in the neighborhood. and spiky is an \"other\" too and all neighborhood (mom, grocer etc.)hate her and would like to kill her. but there is a video tape firuz had recorded so suspects are kaya, firuz and tunç. at the end of the examinations of the neighborhood, the police succeeded to make people accuse each other, make up false stories and agree the accusation. finally, the police tortured kaya (who do not want to agree the \"confession\"), made up the \"necklace story\" so he signed. 9th is spiky (kirpi) who had been killed by the police (or us!) in the examination room of the police office. and the last question: why we (or the police) killed spiky? katil polis! **spolier',\n"," 'it\\'s official, folks -- hou hsiao-hsien does not have a thought in his pretty little head. are you wondering why he chose shu qi as

-- an impossible directorial feat -- get trapped making this laconic sub-jarmusch reality porn for two films in a row now? millennium mambo may be dead weight, but at least it has two great shots, shots that hint at hou\\'s true calling as the film equivalent of odilon redon: those shots are the sex scene with the arrhythmically blinking lights and the opening shot of shu qi floating down a blue corridor. his m.o. while making cafe lumiere seems to have been to remove the two great shots from millennium mambo to make it more consistent. you be the judge if that sounds appealing. hou does not need to refine -- you cannot refine the limbo idea further than flowers of shanghai. he needs to expand, to bloat outwards, to release the inner expressionist and genre-revitalizer that is being squandered so senselessly on clichéd minimalism. it\\'s time for him to do a live-action remake of akira or something. this kind of art film where the actors are supposed to be authentic because they are held facelessly in long-shot and speak in monosyllables is now every last bit as safe, ghettoized and stagnant as the hollywood action blockbuster. ( what is the connection between \"reality\" and people who can not talk? it seems to me that people \"in real life\" never stop jabbering. ) then again, considering that 2005 alone brought big-budget movies as diverse and rich in ideas as aeon flux, the island, and king kong, it\\'s now safe to say that even michael bay has surpassed hou, and that\\'s really sad. the good news is that, though hou is in his 50s, it frankly feels to me as if he has not even begun. there are a couple moments in this film that show the promise is still there, such as a moody bit early on in the bookstore when the room dims to a bloody sunset-red while hitoto talks about babies with the faces of goblins. but whatever fear is holding him back, however comfortable it is to make the same film over and over and be hailed by the gullible and pretentious as the savior of cinema, hou, your time as the darling of the rotterdam, venice, toronto, berlin and whatever else film festivals is almost up and people are catching onto your ruse double-quick. two words for you: atom egoyan. two more words, or maybe three: tsai ming-liang. you are now cribbing from both of these tedious frauds who are about to go up their own dark tunnels forever. risk your shirt on a sci-fi epic, sell out, be reviled -- but leave the social critiques to people that have no eye and no heart. let your painterly talent express itself to the full. you are not going to ever get out of limbo otherwise.',\n"," \"a movie about dealing with the problems with growing up and being true to yourself, blue juice is mind candy for those who like surfing and cornwall. sean pertwee is the real star of this film, while the more famous catherine zeta jones plays his girlfriend and ewan mcgregor plays his drug addicted pal. for those who do not like surfing or cornwall in the slightest, you'll find that it takes a long time before the movie even hints at being interesting. the beginning is slow and spends too much time on long shots of only slightly interesting landscapes. plus too many main characters leads to most of them being one dimensional. the plot is an interesting idea but because of the shallow characters you have no idea why they act in the situations they are put in. only ewan, sean and catherine's characters make this a film worth being on videotape, which is why it was only released on videotape in the us after ewan and catherine reached mainstream fame.\",\n"," 'warning: may contain some spoilers. i do not think i have ever gone to a chop socki movie and expected to see the next titanic or the next american beauty. i do not want to see a multi layered, subtle film that has lots of plot twists and turns and characters that surprise me. what i do want to see is a bunch of guys beating the snot out each other and doing things that they should not be able to do. i love all the greats in regards to this type of film. from guys like chuck norris, bruce lee, steven seagal, some jcvd, jeff speakman ( anyone ever see the perfect weapon? ), jackie chan and of course jet li. i have seen every film of jet\\'s released in north america and every film he amazes me with what he can do. i do not really see the difference between a film like crouching tiger and kiss of the dragon. they are both fun, entertaining films to watch but they are not by any means worthy of oscar consideration. but then again, you are talking about a bunch of fossils who think shakespeare in love is better than saving private ryan. kod is nothing but a pure adrenaline rush. bridget fonda is along for the ride and so is the guy from bad boys and the patriot (tcheky karyo), but all you really need is jet li and you have yourself a great action film. but perhaps what separates this film from some of the other martial arts films if that in most fight movies, the action sequences are good, really good, but kod takes some of the fights a step further. i was amazed at some of the choreography displayed. not just by jet but by some of his opponents. it is thrilling to see a small man fight two bigger men and watch them fall. that is exactly what happens when jet meets two massive blond twins schooled in martial arts. as they say, the bigger they are, the harder they fall. and that is true in this case, but not before jet takes a good beating. the plot, well, who really cares, but jet li gets mixed up in some french plot to smuggle heroine and he has to stop the perpetrators. as i said, the plot is really not the core of the film, even though it was written by luc besson. all you really need to know is that if you enjoy this kind of action, then this is one film that you can not pass up. it will please even the most skeptical critics. one particularly amusing scene is when jet walks into a police station to go after the bad guys. he opens one door to try to escape and buy himself some time and it is there that he finds a room full of black belts practising their karate. jet takes his jacket off and invites all of them to bring it on. this reminded me of a funny scene in wayne\\'s world when wayne and garth open a door and behind it there is a bunch of spies doing a bunch of spy things like climbing walls and fighting. they close the door and say something to the effect of \" i always wanted to see that.\" well in this film, it is not so much a joke as it is a reality. it is one of the most impressive fight sequences i have ever seen in any film, with all due respect to bruce lee. kod is not a martin scorsese film, nor is it a film by coppola or truffaut or fellinni. it is a film by chris nahon that stars jet li. i could not tell you what nahon has done before this and to be honest i really do not care all that much. if he continues to make films like this, with a flair for the ridiculous and an eye for action, then i think he will be around for a while. but what i can tell you is that li is the best at what he does. and this is one kick-ass-action film. there is not much to dislike about it, unless you do not like violence and then i would recommend you stay away. but if action and chop socki and deceit and betrayal is what you crave, then go see kod. 8.5 out of 10-- some excellent action and fighting scenes make this one a great summer flick.',\n"," \"i was really excited to see this. i have never heard of mcg and i have never seen any of his work until now. they said he was a bad director and they were not kidding. here are a few things i have a problem with: 1. where was the war that we get clips of from the first three terminator films? the wars looked awesome. there was a huge battle going on. people dying, terminators everywhere, etc. it was intense! here? nothing! we only have around maybe 5 or 10 different terminators. 2. why was there a 9 foot tall terminator? why could not the john conner and the others hear it coming? something that huge would probably make the ground shake signifying that something is wrong. 3. why did not skynet terminate kyle reese once they got their hands on him? i remember in the first terminator, the terminator was merciless. he ripped that one gangster's heart clean out of his chest. why did not he do that to kyle? 4. why does skynet have prison cells that hold humans? why are they capturing them? why not kill them? is not that the whole point of their decision that they decided in a microsecond as stated by kyle reese in the terminator? 5. why are there keypads on the cell doors? skynet is one giant computer right? why not have skynet be in control of the doors? they do not need keypads! 6. what was the whole point of marcus? he was useless throughout the entire film! i did not give a damn about his character in the slightest! he only becomes useful in the end when he gives john his heart. that was the only reason he was there? you have got to be kidding me! 7. why did mcg direct this? this guy is a moron and has no talent! the movie has nothing to do with the others except for having the machines from the other films. the hk's, t-800s, etc. that was it. mcg obviously did not see any of the terminator films. 8. why was this given a pg-13 rating? i think the movie would have been so much better if it was given a different director and a different rating. they thought they would make more money if they gave it a pg-13 rating? they were dead wrong! 9. in the factory toward the end, you see terminators being built! why are not these terminators being deployed to kill john and the resistance? it looks like they are being built in the factory but skynet is not activating them! is not skynet's primary objective to wipe out the resistance and their leader john conner? why are not they accomplishing this? 10. why was arnold only added at the end? i guess since arnold ran for governor he could not do movies. obviously he can not but they did a cgi version of him fighting john. i guess if arnold was not governor, they would not need marcus. they could have arnold instead. also, when arnold fights john, why does not he just pull his heart out? instead, he just tosses him around for about five or ten minutes. it's stupid. those are the 10 reasons why i think this movie is garbage. i give this movie 1 star out of 10. please do not make terminator 5 unless you intend to make it good.\",\n"," 'this is one of the best films i have seen all year. i

factory, some cycling, most walking, moving right or left. along with melies, the lumieres are both the starting point and the point of departure for cinema - with melies begins narrative fiction, cinema, fantasy, artifice, spectacle; with the lumieres pure, unadorned, observation. the truth. there are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of cinema from the latter into the tired formulae of the former. but consider this short again. there is nothing 'objective' about it. the film is full of action - a static, inhuman scene burst into life, activity, and the quiet harmony of the frame is ruptured, decentred from the back to right or left (but never, of course, the front, where the camera is). and yet the camera stands stock still, contains the energy, the possible subversion, subordinates it to its will. the cinematograph may be a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes - to map out the world, edit it, restrict it, limit it. worse is the historical reality of the film. these factory workers are lumiere employees. the bosses are spying on their workers, the unseen eye regarding his faceless minions. the film therefore describes two types of imprisonment. behind the gates, the workers are confined in their workplace. the opening of the gate seems to be an image of freedom, escape, but they face another wall, the fourth wall, further confining them. the first film is also the first example of cctv surveillance, an image of unseen, all-seeing authority entrapping its servants. a frightening, all too prophetic movie.\",\n","

same theme of the show must go on. in addition to keeler and powell the films featured the kaleidiscopic choreography of busby berkeley, show stopping tunes and many of the same supporting players. all are arguably classics of their genre but i must admit a clear preference for footlight due to it's pace energy and lead james cagney. warren william in gold diggers and warner baxter in 42nd street acquit themselves admirably as the shows production heads- particularly baxter as the burned out julian marsh in search of one last box office smash. both lack the infectious energy of cagney however, who perfectly compliments the frenetic pace of putting on a broadway musical. he is an absolute whirlwind as he deals with production numbers, unscrupulous partners and a gold digging girlfriend. of course cagney alone does not make footlight the classic that it is. the script crackles with some sharp double entendres delivered by a superlative supporting cast featuring frank mchugh, hugh herbert, guy kibbee and especially joan blondell who cuts everyone down to size. busby berkeley's dance numbers are surreal, suggestive and risqué and done just in the nick of time before

was released as \"pardon my terror.\") it obviously was too good for the stooges to pass up, and it was finally filmed by the stooges at the end of 1947. old man goodrich calls ace detectives shemp, larry, and moe out of fear that he will be murdered. when they arrive at his home, goodrich has disappeared, and his niece and assorted goons try to get rid of the stooges. will they find goodrich and bring the niece and goons to justice? shemp is particularly funny in this film. his reactions after being given a mickey by christine mcintyre are superb; he gives his trademark sound (eeb-eeb-eeb) and miss mcintyre is noticeably trying not to laugh! other funny scenes: the close-up of moe\\'s mug looking through the camera lens; and the in-the-dark fight with all cast members involved. nikko the goon (played by duke york) is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a stooges film. with his kinked hair, he could almost pass for a stooge, if he did not tower over everyone else! \"who done it?\" is a gem among the stooges films with shemp. even die-hard curly fans will enjoy this one! a true stooge classic. 9 out of 10.',\n"," 'i saw this for cheap at a used

excellent job of setting the mood for the unraveling debacle that was che's bolivian adventure. you really get the impression of the total timidity and bewilderment of the bolvian peasant to che's

foundation had left the vile d-generation x stable unchallenged in the wwe. their despicable leader shawn michaels had stolen the title from hart thanks to the interference of vince mcmahon and, with help from his cohorts triple h and chyna had systematically taken out anyone who challenged his supremacy. but at the royal rumble a new contender had emerged. stone cold steve austin. hated by mcmahonagement, austin had dx worried. so worried in fact that they\\'d enlisted the help of \"the baddest man on the planet\" mike tyson as a special enforcer. austin would have the odds firmly against him in his title match with shawn michaels. but first, there was an undercard to get through which kicked off with the legion of doom winning a forgettable 15 team battle royal to become no.1 contenders for the tag titles. i\\'d actually forgotten this match existed until i rewatched the ppv. no very good and really highlighted the lack of depth in the tag division at that period in time. next match saw the light heavyweight title defended by champion taka michonoku against aguila. the wwe had established the light heavyweight title to compete with the strong cruiserweight division in wcw. it was not successful and this was the only time the title was ever defended at wrestlemania. short match, going about five minutes, and in fact too short for much to be achieved. what little they did was exciting and this was a nice little match which saw taka retaining his title. ok, our next match saw dx member triple h defending the wwe european title, which he\\'d won in farcical fashion from shawn michaels on raw in december and had not defended on ppv, against owen hart, the sole survivor. triple h got a big entrance with the dx band there to perform his theme song. chyna accompanied triple h to ringside, but was then handcuffed to wwe commissioner sgt slaughter. triple h and owen have a nice little match, before chyna interfered causing a low blow on hart which leads to triple h retaining the title. good match, could have been great had it gone slightly longer. but of course we would not want to take time away from our next match which saw real life husband and wife marc mero and sable defeat goldust and luna vachon in the first mixed tag match at wrestlemania in 8 years. and, in all honesty, it was not worth the wait. while not terrible, the match was in no way memorable either. this was the nearing the end of mero\\'s only run in the wwe and the main purpose was to continue the disintegration of his relationship with sable. next up we saw ken shamrock flip out and cost himself the intercontinental championship as he destroyed ic champion the rock, but then refused to let go of his ankle lock submission hold, resulting in the referee reversing his decision. this was a short match, but decent for what it was. next saw the first good match of the night as wwe tag team champions the new age outlaws lost their titles to cactus jack and chainsaw charlie in a fun dumpster match. the decision was overturned the following night as cactus and chainsaw had thrown the outlaws into a dumpster backstage, rather than the one being used in the match, but this was still a fun match. now it was time for the highly anticipated first ever meeting between kane and his brother the undertaker. kane had cost undertaker the wwe championship at the royal rumble and then \"killed\" him when he helped shawn michaels lock undertaker in a casket and set him on fire as revenge for the undertaker burning down their parents house and leaving him horribly disfigured years before. this was a decent match and told a nice story as the underataker absorbed everything kane could throw at him and then knocked him out with three tombstones to end the match. this left only the main event which saw wwe champion face steve austin with mike tyson as the guest enforcer. michaels had suffered a debilitating back injury in his match with the undertaker at the royal rumble and was remarkable in this match despite his physical limitations. triple h and chyna were banished to the back in the early going after interfering from the outside. the match ended with austin ducking an attempt at sweet chin music and hitting the stone cold stunner with the ref down. tyson then came into the ring to count the three, celebrating the win with austin and then knocking out michaels after the match. it turned out tyson and austin were together and the cat had been playing with the mouse all along. that was the final ppv match for shawn michaels for four and a half years. it helped establish austin as the biggest star in the wrestling business and the mainstream publicity garnered by tyson\\'s appearance proved a crucial turning point in the wwe\\'s battle with wcw. austin would go on to become the biggest star in wwe history, and along with the rock, mick foley, the undertaker and triple h lead the wwe through the period where they would gain their highest level of cultural relevance. and it all started here at wrestlemania 14.',\n"," \"track listing: 1. spiderbait - outta my head 2. lash - take me away 3.lavaland - everwonder 4. machine gun fellatio -

our respective \"advanced\" nations. i write from japan, where women merely got the right to vote 60 years ago, and female technical engineers are a recent phenomenon. pubs in england were once all-male, the business world was totally off-limits for women in america until rather recently, and women in china had their feet bound so they could not develop feet strong enough to escape their husbands. iran is conveniently going through this stage in our time, and we get a good look at how ridiculous we have all looked at one time or another. back to the issue of sexuality, we are made to wonder what it may be intrinsically about women that make them unfit for a soccer game (the official reason is that the men are bad). especially such boyish girls, a couple so much so that you even get the feeling that lesbianism is on the agenda as well. i think one point is that not all women are the same, and the women the police are trying to \"protect\" are not the ones who would try to get in in the first place. the opening scenes of the approach to the stadium makes you appreciate the valor of the young women trying to get in -- and each one separately -- at all. it is a brutish man\\'s world. any woman brave enough to try to go should be allowed! the world of sexuality is not one-size-fits-all. meanwhile, the apprehended criminal girls bond inside the makeshift pen awaiting their deportation to who-knows-where, and in a much more subtle way, begin to bond with the guards keeping watch over them. these had definite ideas about women and femininity, which were being challenged head-on. the change in attitude is glacial, but visible. since the movie is pure iran from the first moment, it takes a little easing-into for the foreigner, but the characters have a special way of endearing themselves to you, and you end up getting the whole picture, and even understanding the men\\'s misunderstandings and give them slack. the supposed villain is the unseen patriarchy of the ayatollahs, which remain unseen and unnamed, and likely unremembered. knowing that this movie was filmed during the actual event of the iran-bahrain match gives me a feeling of awe for all involved.',\n"," 'this is the first of these \"8 films to die for\" collection that i have seen and it\\'s certainly not made me want to see any of the rest... although i have heard at least a couple of them are decent. i do not know, this was not terrible but it did not really do much for me. your basic dysfunctional cannibal family in suburbia kind of thing, mom & dad died, the family sold the farm & moved to san francisco (?) where they continued to bring home stray food sources whenever possible. the best part of this was the creepy goth sister, who of course invites a friend over from school that never leaves. anyway, of course we have a butcher shop in the basement and so on and so on. this family is sort of like the white-bread version of the sawyer clan, they are nasty & they do bad things but they ain\\'t go no soul. i see a lot of reviews from people that liked this, and i guess i do not know what i missed, but i found it to be very mediocre & i would not

friends. it has become our benchmark for how completely rubbish a film can be. after 15 years i still feel i was unfairly robbed of 1.5 hours of my life. we sat there staring in disbelief like rabbits

(she is deeply suspicious of richard, who she suspects may have distributed further copies of daffy\\'s map). one of the film\\'s most chilling incidents comes after christo, one of the group, is seriously injured after being attack by a shark. he can only be saved if he is taken back to the mainland for immediate medical treatment, but because this might result in the community\\'s existence being revealed to outsiders, sal refuses to permit this and christo is left to die. there is some good acting in the film, especially from tilda swinton who gives a nicely judged performance as sal, a woman with steely eyes and a cut-glass accent who for most of the movie can seem threatening without ever issuing any direct threats or even raising her voice. this increases the impact of the scene at the end where sal finally does lose her cool. the beautiful virginie ledoyen makes a charming and unaffected francoise, and i also liked guillaume canet as etienne. originally seen as a loser, the man who loses his girlfriend to richard, etienne later emerges as the community\\'s voice of conscience, the one man who refuses to abandon the dying christo. it was, however, unfortunate that the director danny boyle, who wanted ewan mcgregor to play richard, was overruled by the studio, as leonardo di caprio, although he is better here than he was in \"titanic\", tends to overact. the film tends to deteriorate in the second half, with the plot becoming difficult to follow as richard, alienated from his fellow-members of the group, starts to become mentally unstable. the style of direction was excessively hectic for my tastes, and the sequence where richard imagines he is a character in a video game was particularly eccentric. despite its potentially interesting themes, \"the beach\" falls just short of being a very good film. 7/10',\n"," \"night watch is a low budget russian vampire movie that depicts the eternal battle of good and evil in modern day moscow. centuries after a truce between two opposing forces there is a risk that an 'other' or gifted human (anyone seen neo?) will tip the balance of power. as with the vampire movie underworld there are forces that prevent the battle from spilling over into the real world. the day watch are vampires assigned to police their brethren who disguise themselves as adidas tracksuit wearing chavs who drive audi tts and aspire to be pop stars (the uk is full of vampires!). the night watch must step in to prevent evil forces from doing harm to innocent humans. the special effects in the movie are decent and one would be forgiven for mistaking the movie as a hollywood title at times. however, there are other instances when it looks as though the movie is being acted out by a bunch of friends in a warehouse or derelict flat. the cheap grainy feel is likely to be part of the desired gothic, art house effect so many will however enjoy its raw non glossy appeal. whilst most sci fi/ horror fans will be instantly attracted to the story there is not a great deal of depth to the plot or characters and there is the strong feeling that you are being set up for sequel. the movie also moves very slowly at times and the surreal action can be confusing. whilst some would argue that this adds complexity and intrigue it cant really mask the lack of depth in the story line or characters and will not somehow make it more interesting than it really is. the special effects also often seem to be on display rather than interwoven with plot. there is an interesting end to the movie but the film has been dragged out for too long by its conclusion for you to care. overall an interesting movie that is likely to herald the start of a potentially significant contribution from russia to the international action genre but as a stand alone entity it is average at best.\",\n"," 'this movie was highly recommended by some folks. i saw it in cinema with my brother and his 2 friends. at the end we were in disgust and regretting our decision to pay extra money and losing one weekend over this. from the start we did not understand what s going on , there was only killing with bullets firing in an unrealistic fashion. quite a few action sequences were unbelievable carrying no weight. in one final battle cars were coming directly straight antonio and his 2 buddies they spray bullets over bullets , not a single one hits the while his shot just inside from his guitar case is far more accurate. the whole film was lost during the process of mindless gun fights. i think its successor was way better than it. such movies can only be enjoyed very much teenage and some immature minds who only want to see violence with no proper plot.',\n"," '\"gespenster\" (2005) forms, together with \"yella\" (2007), and \"jerichow\" (2008), the gespenster-trilogy of director christian petzold, doubtless one of the creme-de-la-creme german movie directors of our time. roughly, \"gespenster\" tells the story of a french woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a 3 years old child while the mother turned around her head for 1 minute in berlin - and has never been seen ever. since then, the mother keeps traveling to berlin whenever there is a possibility and searches, by aid of time-dilated photography, for girls of the age of approximately the present age of her age. as we hear later in the movie, the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter marie. however, this time, when she meets nina, everything comes quite different. the movie does not bring solutions, not even part-solutions, and insofar, it is rather disappointing. we are not getting equipped either in order to decide if the mother is really insane or not, if her actual daughter is still alive or not. most disappointing is the end. after what we have witnessed in the movie, it is an imposition for the watcher that he is let alone as the auteur leaves nina alone. the simple walking away symbolizing that nothing has changed, can be a strong effect of dramaturgy (f.ex. in \"umberto d.\"), but in \"gespenster\", it is displaced. since critics have been suggesting freudian motives in this movie, let me give my own attempt: why is it that similar persons do not know one another, especially not the persons that another similar person knows? this is quite an insane question, agreed, from the standpoint of aristotelian logic, according to which the notion of the individual holds. the individual is such a person that does not share any of its defining characteristics with anyone else. so, the aristotelian answer to my question is: they do not know one another because their similarity is by pure change. everybody who is not insane, believes that. however, what about the case if these similar persons share other similarities which can hardly be by change, e.g. scarfs on their left under ankle or a heart-shaped birthmark under their right shoulder-blade? this is the metaphysical context out of which this movie is made, although i am not sure whether even the director has realized that. despite our modern, aristotelian world, the superstition, conserved in the mythologies of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their individuality, and that individuality, therefore, is not something erratic, but rather diffusional, so that the borders between persons are open, such and similar believes build a strong backbone of irrational-ism despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking - a source of gespenster of the most interesting kind.',\n"," 'a bit of a preview to the sixth sense, the theme treats childhood conflicts with a respectful interest. not only does the director get virtuoso performances from his juvenile leads, but his pacing, lighting, visuals, humorous one-liners is simply overwhelming in a neophyte. rewatch the scene where joseph cross and his grandfather are walking outside and the kid eventually cries on grandfather\\'s chest. long, complicated scene with changes in emotion, relationships, timing etc... and done in a single cut. amazing. i appreciate the oriental philosophy touch (as in eastern). while i heard that m. is an episcopalian, he retains at his core some mysticism which is evident in both movies. once cole seer understands his \"gift\" he stops being a psychotic outcast and starts a new direction in his life. once joshua wakes up and accepts his surroundings, he gets his sign and his answers... what is this, zen/hindu/catholic?',\n"," \"i have not read the novel, though i understand that this is somewhat different from it; the fact that i rather enjoyed this, coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre, leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book. having not read a single word of austen's writing, i really can not compare this to any of her work. what i can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is clever, witty, and well-delivered, as well as the biggest source of comedy in this. this made me laugh out loud a lot, with perfect british and verbal material. every acting performance is spot-on, and paltrow completely nails the role of a kind matchmaker. the characters are well-written, credible and consistent. i did find a couple of them extremely irritating, however, and while i think that at least some of that was meant to be funny, it tended to get repeated excessively, and it honestly was not amusing the first time they appeared. the editing and cinematography are marvelous, and everything looks utterly gorgeous. plot and pacing are great, you are never bored. it does end in a *really* obvious manner, but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer. i can not claim that this did not entertain me, it did from start to finish, and i'd watch it again. there is brief language in this. i recommend this to any fan of romance stories. 7/10\",\n"," 'i first

am 100% sure that each and every scene and detail is well crafted out in the script word by word, image by image, page by page, and that is reflected on the screen. but the whole approach is immature coming from a veteran director. the characterization is poor, each scene is like a stand alone scene of enacted on stage, each single scene is stretched to unbearable limit of irritation, the music on the over-stretched scene is jarring, the sync sound is badly recorded, each dialogue is a pick-up from 60-70s pot boiler, and even with range of emotions given to the characters, all actors are under-utilized and wasted. a good movie on paper does not necessary result in a good movie on screen is the big, loud and clear message one gets after seeing this crap. only saving grace of this movie is the cinematography. on the other hand, if you blindly follow hollywood players, or believe that purely by eliminating songs and putting in gorgeous imagery you automatically transcend all flaws of the typical feelbad-flick and will get to watch a better film, then this one is for you.',\n"," 'i had great hopes for this movie... none of which were fulfilled. my family and i enjoyed the first two

were pretty good, and almost made up for the flimsy plot. but did anyone else notice that this movie was set in louisiana (the ride at disneyland is in the part of the park called the french quarter,

although this is what many people would just think of as an animation, there are performances that actually seem as though they are real. we feel golgo's loneliness and leonard dawson's hate and his daughter in law's pain. it is the art of the film that really is portrayed amazingly throughout. the scene in which duke's car speeds along the beach, or when gold and silver (two of the hired mercenaries) attack him in dawson's office building near the climax of the film are genius. it is the simplicity of the art that shows what needs to be shown and keeps the story linear, instead of making a muzzled storyline as in other action films. this film does not try to make itself more than what it is. it knows that it is an action film and uses this as the foundation to work with, instead of making out it is some sort of psychological examination of killers like so many hollywood films. it just is what it is, and does this well. just another note: the scene in which gold and

peckinpah\\'s the wild bunch. when we first meet borgnine\\'s character, he\\'s standing alone on the streets of a ghost town looking every bit the part of a western rancher. but before the film\\'s over we see him dressed in the dark robes of a satanic priest, and in an unflattering spandex costume that makes him come off as an obese hermaphroditic version of wonder woman. several times in the film, roused into a charismatic fever by his satan-sermons, ernie ads the final touch: he turns into a goat. then there\\'s william shatner. dressed like an itinerant farm laborer in the most hee-hawish straw hat you ever saw, he shows up with a.45 in one hand and a sacred amulet in another, projecting a \"get behind me, satan\" attitude. he lasts about five minutes. but in that time he manages to shoot a few of ernest\\'s goons (which apparently causes them to leak rainbow sherbet), get tied to a cross, branded like a cow, share a passionate kiss -tongue included- with his own mother, and get stuffed into a what looks like an old watermelon full of lost souls. then tom skerrit comes in with his girlfriend and eddy \\'ggrreenn acres is the place to be!\\' albert. together, they cause some more sherbet leaks, then break the watermelon. this does two things. it causes borgnine to to yell, \"seize them!\", which a high priest of satan has to say at least once in such a movie. it also causes a cold front to inexplicably appear in that little arizona ghost-town. it rains, and all the satan-goons melt. whether they melted because they are goons-of-hell deprived of their holy watermelon, or just because they live in arizona and are unused to precipitation is not explained. the movie ends with tom skerrit lovingly embracing, and crying on the shoulder of, earnest borgnine. if only borgnine had been a goat in that scene, the movie would be priceless.',\n"," 'this was a great show about a deeply insecure woman with intense emotional problems. the show catalogued

an american and having different values. this is not the \"e.t.\" feel good movie nor is it an interesting and beautiful, gut-wrenching movie like the swedish movie \"my life as a dog\", although it had tried many attempts to redeem itself. the characters are mean and self-serving, promoting the value of \"being useful\" over common sense logic such as \"self reliance\". **warning!**spoiler alert**details of movie below** cj7 starts out with a very sad tale of a mother-less child who lives in a dump with his father who is a construction worker. the father spends his hard earned money on a private school that he can not afford and forgoes basic necessities such as food, shelter, and clothing so his son can go to this school and have the opportunity to learn. the father never studied in school and constantly reminds his son that they are poor because he is uneducated and can not get a better job. the son, dickey, is ridiculed at school because he comes to school dirty, his shoes and school uniform is from the dumpster, and it is obvious that he is poor. nonetheless, like all humans, we all yearn to be accepted. one day, the child who bullies dickey, comes to school with a very cool toy, a robotic dog named \"cj\" and evokes jealous from dickey. later while dickey and his father are watching cartoons in a storefront window, dickey runs off inside to the toy store and screams for the \"cj\" toy. the father feels awful for spanking the boy to let go of the toy and shame that he cannot buy the toy. cut to a scene where the father is in the dump looking for better shoes for the boy. in his discoveries, the father runs into a ufo that leaves a nice green ball that the father brings back to dickie. he claims it\\'s a better toy than cj. the best scene of this movie is the scene where the green ball is about to hatch and dickey witnesses the ball hatching and has hallucinations throughout the process. after the hatching, dickey then dreams that the friendly, magical alien (who he thinks is a toy with batteries) will create additional magical electronic devices to make him smarter, stronger, better, etc... at school. the reality is that the green alien dog like character cannot do that.. instead the dog takes a dump in his hands (is this suppose to be funny?) and then also has exploding diarrhea\\'s out of fear (is this suppose to be funny as well?). dickey abuses the dog, throws it away in a trash can at school, and then has regrets. the dog only wants to please its master. this is where the senses of culture clashes. as an asian-american that understands confucian philosophy, i do no value the class hierarchy that animal must obey men and that the younger generation of men must always blindly obey the older generation without question and without doubt. it is painful to watch the dog (alien or not) to be abused by everyone until the end, when the dog sacrifices it\\'s own life to the elder of the family (the father). in death, the dog revered and respected. throughout the movie, it is even more painful to watch the son suffer for his father\\'s pride. the father\\'s boss states that his own son goes to public school, why should not dickey? dickey is failing and \"cheating\" in school and his father stubbornly wastes his money on the expensive school where dickey is not learning. dickey\\'s father is too busy trying to keep up with appearances. in the end, even if the father is brought back to life by the dog, the father is still a loser, poor, and can not get a date. dickey is still dumb and picked on at school.

all of this helps add to the bland movie atmosphere, and it\\'s not helped by the flintstones-like music playing all the while. the most annoying thing though was the cannibal tribe. every cannibal in the tribe all chant the same noise constantly (as if making that noise and bouncing is a ritual). miraculously, though they all say the same thing all the time, they all understand each other. after watching ten minutes where the only thing on the soundtrack is that chanting and the screechy, whiny screams of the \"victims\" gets old really fast. the wardrobe and makeup was terrible, and the only gore effects that are good are the real animal killings (horribly out of line, with an orangutan having its head broken open), which are only there to make the movie seem as hardcore as the italians\\' movies. to add to that, the infamous tomahawk-boomerang scene has to be the most hilariously stupid scene in movie history. the only thing i can note about primitif is that the cannibal tribe at the very least looked realistic, dirty, and gritty, unlike several other cannibal obscurities. however, everything else in the picture tears that positive note apart. why anyone would pool their money to make this is beyond me. the acting would come better from a kindergarten music class, which does not help the ridiculous events, and the audio and visual elements are scratchy and inept. yes, controversial animal killings are present, mainly to add shock to an incredibly shockless film, thinly disguised as rituals by the tribe. if there are any \"good\" parts to the movie, it was probably taken from other movies. even cannibal completionists would be hard pressed to consider wasting the money for this movie, especially that there is almost no single feature release still in existence. if you can sit through it, even though i do not even recommend putting it in the player, feel free to experience the most boring 90 minutes or so of your life, and hate yourself for never being able to have them back.',\n"," 'so this is where columbia\\'s head of their short subjects unit got his directorial start, eh? yeah,it\\'s none other than mr. jules white who is credited (or is it rather, \"exposed\") as the director of this entry into mgm\\'s dogville series. given co-credit as co-director is one zion myers; whose name is heretofore unknown to us. mr. meyers was, no doubt, the guy who controlled the four-legged thespians and was responsible for training and \"acting\". in short, he must have been the dog trainer on the set. the title of this comedy short is no doubt a play on the mgm feature of the same year, the big house; which starred chester morris, wallace beery, robert montgomery and a stellar cast in support. we must plead ignorance in regards to this title; not having seen it up to this point. (sorry,schultz!) but there are many of the doggie gags that relate to what we have read about the movie*; not to mention some particular character specific gags. for example, we observed a canine convict who st-st-stuttered and deduced,correctly, that the bow-wow actor was mimicking character comedian, roscoe ates. we later cross-checked with the cast of the big house and presto, his name is there! (brilliant deduction, one fit for holmes & watson!) the practice of lampooning popular features was already a tried and true practice in the realm of the comedy short. it was one that seemed to draw no objections from the producers and copyright owners of the major films; but rather quite contrarily received heaps of tassive approval. after all, imitation is said to be the sincerest form of flattery; besides, any producer would welcome even some seemingly irreverent parodying.** as for the movie, itself, we found it to be interesting in a sort of perverse manner. seeing so many of \"man\\'s best friends\" being so artificially animated into one, long and boring sort of anthropomorphic gag seemed very tiring to we, who make up the audience. i mean just how many pooches were made to bark, needlessly, in order to achieve the illusion of \\'talking\\'? when it comes to pets, or \"animal companions\" as the politically correct crowd prefers, we are quite eclectic; favoring not only dogs; but also cats, hamsters and parakeets. we do not enjoy seeing any animal exploited in such a non-funny,extended play format. as incredible as it may seem, the step that mr. jules white made from mgm\\'s shorts to heading up columbia\\'s 2 reeler production would seem to have been not only a $tep up in the area of finance$; but al$o in the arti$tic content. we never thought that being producer-director for the likes of such luminaries as the 3 stooges, andy clyde and hugh herbert, as well as some who certainly had seen better days, such as charley chase, buster keaton and harry langdon; would be a step up cinematically. in case we have not made our point yet; we are officially panning this one. so, view it at your own risk. we warned you! note * we read excellent accounts of both the big house and the laurel & hardy send-up, pardon us (hal roach/mgm, 1931) in both mr. laurel & mr. hardy by john mccabe (1962) and the films of laurel & hardy by william k. everson (1967). both books have our most enthusiastic endorsement. note ** the prison picture became a genre of its own; all owing a debt to the big house. in pardon us, laurel & hardy, hal roach and its director did a first class spoof,the first of many; for a prison comedy became a required theme for so many a screen funny man to come.',\n"," 'the cover made it look like the devils rejects, the opening credits

you might think it\\'s a thriller with a touch of science fiction. but that does not really do this movie justice. there is a fantasy aspect within the sub-conscious minds that is stunning, with lavish visuals and incredible mind-tripping scenarios. there is drama as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by lopez prior to her becoming a solely romantic comedy component) makes contact with the child within and witnesses his terrifying upbringing. and there is most definitely a horror facet due to the sickening actions of the serial killer\\'s evil persona. the movie attempts to function on many different levels and crosses genre boundaries at will. while i feel it ends up being a reasonably bizarre experience, i find it to be completely fascinating. right from the opening credits, with lopez riding a horse through the desert stunningly clothed in a white dress, you will know that you are in for a visual treat. every time the audience leaves reality and follows her into the sub conscious depths of her \"patients\", they are guaranteed a feast of visual and aural delight. the costumes are wonderful creations of angles and colour. the camera leaves regularities at the door and traverses a world where up and down are the same. the characters become rulers of their own domains and transform into creatures worthy of such stature. if you do not enjoy anything else about \"the cell\", you will surely be impressed with the work put into these scenes. the casting is top notch also. jennifer lopez is in her element here, utilizing her natural, compassionate and almost maternal sensibilities, while combining her own striking looks with the lush surroundings, makeup and costumes. she is incredibly sexy and i personally wish someone would find another role for her outside of the rom-com world she has been typecast into that would allow her to experiment further. vince vaughn is fairly convincing as an fbi agent that will do anything to save the life of a young woman. but it is without a doubt vincent d\\'onofrio that has the biggest impression here. it\\'s an extremely difficult role as he is required to bring out multiple emotions within the viewer. we are disgusted at his actions, yet sympathetic towards him due to the trauma he has experienced during his life. he looks magnificently powerful within his realm, yet insecure and vulnerable within the real world. it\\'s a great performance from an underrated actor. while \"the cell\" does not work as well on every level it ambitiously attempts (some of the actions of the characters are not believable) and while it is all based on some fairly flimsy scientific logic, it is an occasionally shocking, visually astounding head trip that rewards multiple viewings.',\n"," \"haines is excellent

unrecognized by her, with her and her growing family. this film is notable for a couple of reasons. the first is it's one of chaplin's first films where he plays a relatively straight role throughout the film, and the second reason is it contains perhaps his first real attempt at pathos in his films: he draws a smiley face on the bar room floor of the girl who left him. however, the print i saw

there is something lacking. the backdrop and integration of the corps was well utilized, but i was less involved than i thought that i would be. perhaps haines\\' character went too far, or got away

7 because kelly did not put as much attention to detail as with his other movies. overall good flick.\",\n"," \"this is one of may all-time favourite films. parker posey's character is over-the-top entertaining, and the librarian motif will not be lost on anyone who has ever worked in the books and stacks world. if you are a library student, rent this. then buy the poster and hang it on your wall. the soundtrack is highly recommendable too. i have shown this film to more library friends than any other -- they all fall in love with it.\",\n"," \"this is a children's movie. is it a great children's movie? no. but, it is an enjoyable children's movie. sure gamera looks like he was constructed at the last second out of an old shopping bag; and, monster x looks like something that you pulled out of a salvation army drop-box. but, this movie has children as the main characters, doing the bulk of the heroics and making the bulk of the sound decisions... there are a tremendous number of plot-holes in this movie; but, if you have got children, and a little patience, you can enjoy ninety minutes of pig-headed adults, brave children and flying turtles... also, there is a certain resemblance to the science fiction novel blameless in abaddon... anyone else notice?...\",\n"," '\"everything is illuminated\" is like viewing a fine piece of museum quality artwork. it absolutely inundates the emotions through a very broad spectrum. jonathan safran foer is played with candor by elijah wood. he is in search of his paternal heritage in the ukraine. his travels bring him in contact with alex, played very well and with extreme humor by eugene hutz. his grandfather is the most emotional tie to this film and he is aptly portrayed by boris leskin. if one finds little humor in the human characters in this cinema, then one has only to turn to mikke, a real dog who is called sammy davis jr. jr. by alex and his grandfather. they also call him the \"seeing eye bitch\". the cinematography is spectacular. the colors are a very important part of the patchwork of the film. it is a film worth the time and emotional investment.',\n"," \"this documentary film is based on incomplete considerations of the evidence, in which brian flemming, perhaps purposely, fails to mention important evidence to the contrary. perhaps his most crucial mistake is one of the earliest: his claims concerning the invalidity of paul's testimony about jesus christ disregard key facts, like: **the existence of some formulated creeds within paul's letters. these creeds suggest that most of the central claims about jesus were already formulated into statements of faith possibly within a few years of christ's death and resurrection. **the testimonies of the early christians can not just be tossed out as mere fantasy. there were indeed many people claiming to be the messiah during that period, but only one of them has remained: jesus. why? because it would have been preposterous for anyone to have actually believed christ was the messiah, and go on to die for those beliefs, if they knew that he had not been resurrected. **even if the gospels are dated more liberally, we are still talking about accounts of jesus written within the lifetimes of other eyewitnesses that would have pointed out inaccuracies in these gospels. and there is evidence that the gospels were written much earlier. what i am saying is that flemming's documentary is an incredibly biased and self-serving piece of work that hodge podges different arguments and evidence to serve his anti-christian view. do not be fooled by poor investigation.\",\n"," 'the movie was well filmed, on a great location, with fantastic backdrops, and is mel gibson accurate on all accounts? no, but directors and cinematographers must make changes and put in their montages what they see as a visual story. a small tribe being abducted to be sacrificed did indeed happen in the time of the film 1517 & 1518 the post classical maya period. even though it was the aztecs who were the strongest in the time portrayed by the film, \"they \\'the mayas\\' were close allies of the aztecs, they shared ideas and religion; and there were trade routes throughout mesoamerica.\\' (adams,1998) were there all kinds of sacrifices going on? yes, the mesoamericans were going through all kinds of bad prophecies, such as the hundred year drought and there had been very little rain for the crops. people were starving, the moon ate the sun, and wild animals were attacking the villagers more and more. since the europeans had already landed in the antilles and had already ventured into the yucatan coast; there was an epidemic of measles and chicken pox that were heavily affecting the american indigenous, who had no resistance for such diseases (the little girl in the movie). these were all signs that the gods were displeased. for the aztecs, mayas and incas blood was life. it was the flow of life, the liquid that provided life for them, and for the gods as well; and if the gods did not get enough blood the gods were unhappy. so the aztecs and mayas were sacrificing at an alarming rate trying to please the gods. this was unfortunate for the villages and tribes in and around the aztec and mayan major cities. since the sacrifices had depleted the population in the larger cities (they could only sacrifice so many of their city people without creating chaos within the city) and most of the citizens and families had already donated a child or an adult male or female to the gods. worriers were ordered to go outside the larger cities and abduct by force several individuals (young, old, women, and children) from the surrounding villages and tribes. the spaniards were very much astonished when they witnessed their first human sacrifice, talk about cultural clash. most of the surrounding villagers did not want to partake in the sacrifices and several of the small villages had already donated a number of their kinfolks to the city leaders for sacrifices. hence the bloody mess at the temples throughout mexico in those times was horrendous, \"approximately 40,000 individuals had been sacrificed in one year in teotihuacan alone\" (adams, 1998). imagine about 100 sacrifices per day. this is why cortés had no problem recruiting 50,000 to 100,000 indigenous fighters to help his 400 spaniard eventually defeat the aztecs. the thrill of seeing a young father and proud tribesmen going to save his wife and children is what movies are made of. the setting in the jungle, the animals, the danger, the trill of victory are all in this film, and even better because of the mayan background. see it, let the true or untrue facts rest (were the mayans savages or not?), and the movie is no more gory or graphic than the video games our children here in the usa play.',\n"," 'an excellent movie where everything is beautiful - from the crumbling, claustrophobic backdrops of the antagonists\\' hiding places, the actors and the background music. besides showing an unusual homosexual relationship, the film also questions the relationship between sex, love and violence - even when the main characters turn \"straight\" violence and death hang in the air, with scenes sex often interspliced with those of death and agony. more importantly, you can not help but feel sorry - and yet almost envious - for the doomed (and did i mention beautiful?) lovers as they slide towards their inevitable end, just for the incredible passion they have for each other.',\n"," \"not really sure what to say about this one, aside from i did not like it much. the actors were all fine, there were a few laughs here and there. the ending was not too bad, but i suppose after the mess of a plot that came before it, that's not a huge feat. half the time you have no idea what's going on, and by the time you might have a clue, you do not care anymore. this plods along at a pace most snails would be ashamed of, and i found myself fighting to stay awake the whole time. do not get me wrong, i do not mind a slow-paced movie, so long as it keeps your attention. this does not. overall, is this a good movie? no, not really. could it cure insomnia? i would not be surprised. 3.5/10\",\n"," 'ok, a slasher movie. a very, very stupid slasher movie. we got your stereotypical teenagers in a house thing going. we got a fbi agent that\\'s seen dirty harry one time too many. \"so what\\'s the secret... punks?\" we got about 4 different little camera shots and scene that make no sense at all. \"hey man, i am fixing the sprinklers\" ((that guy was my favorite part of the movie)) suddenly there\\'s a preacher tied up on a couch watching home movies, he gets killed. they follow the killer into the middle of nowhere, with no cops. suddenly she\\'s in a church, wearing a wedding dress. i swear this is the stupidest slasher movie i have ever seen.',\n"," \"anyone giving this movie a good review obviously must have had something to do with its creation. this movie is a painful suckfest. the acting is stiff, the stock generic soundtrack is laughable, the direction is bland and strangest of all, the teacher really is not all that attractive (making the student's blatant advances all the more awkward). the creative minds behind this trash should disband and spread out to prevent further displays of such concentrated craptitude. i am certain that some starving kids in africa could have used the money squandered on this project. hell, the funds would have also seen a more enlightened purpose fueling a crack-addict; at least someone would be getting some entertainment out of it. for the sole reason that it did not give me a terminal illness, i'll give this film a two.\",\n"," 'this movie starts off well. when the guy comes to the main characters base with that scrool then he is chopped up by the screamers. the plot also starts of well. little ground digging (like miniature versions of those things in \"tremors\") robots are used for war, and guys on the same side as them wear wrist bands that let the screamers know they are of the same side. the people in the base have to smoke some red cigarettes to protect their lungs from something in the air \"we have to protect our lungs from sh*t by putting sh*t in them\". but this movie gets bad in a hurry. we really want to turn it off when those kids (screamers in kids bodys) are walking and the main characters going \"help me\". but some decent special effects and ok atmostphere let me give this film 6/10.',\n","
