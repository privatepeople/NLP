It\\'s an odyssey, a comic book, a western (in the East), a black comedy, an operatic nightmare, a sci-fi cautionary tale, an \"audience movie\"... It\\'s a showcase for underutilized talent. Utterly creepy, funny, bleak and suspenseful with rich characters, memorable dialog and stimulating visuals. Oh, and that wonderful cast! That wonderful score! This gem will never truly get the praise that it deserves. Also, are there any doubts as to where James Cameron got the inspiration for his \"tech-noir\" look for \"The Terminator\"? Sure, we all know Jim worked on this movie, as we know from whence Carpenter drew many of HIS inspirations. But there\\'s nothing wrong with giving credit where it\\'s due. Notable standouts: Harry Dean Stanton\\'s delivery of the greeting, \"Gentlemen. Mr. President.\", as he walks into a room of the Duke\\'s filthy, thrift-store attired goons and the camera pans over to the president adorned with a blonde wig. Frank Doubleday as Romero. (What a classic entrance/introduction!) He looks like the Heat Miser from that Christmas TV special but solidly establishes the inmates as horrific androgynous, diseased cannibals. Ernest Borgnine, successfully topping his portrayal of Mr. Rogo from \"The Poseidon Adventure\" with his performance as Cabbie; simultaneously hilarious and tragic.',\n"," \"I liked this movie just about as much as the first, if not more. I know it's odd to say that about a sequel, and a sequel going straight to DVD without it's original cast no less, but I really liked it. I thought it was a good movie about following your heart and finding your place and passion. Some people are saying that it has the same storyline as the original, but I didn't see that. I thought it was completely different. There are different people, different surroundings. Sarah is already at Julliard in this one and she's in love with rap and hip-hop music at this point. How can you be more different than that? I'll definitely buy it to add it to the original in my collection of DVDs at home. :)\",\n"," 'Pakeezah is in my mind the greatest achievement of Indian cinema. The film is visually overwhelming but also emotionally breathtaking. The music, the songs, the sets, the costumes, the cinematography, in fact every creative element is worthy of superlatives.',\n"," \"At the opposite end of the spectrum from RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is David Hemmings' utterly inferior adventure regarding the salvage of a World War II-era plane with a valuable cargo. Assets include beautiful New Zealand settings, Brian May's energetic music score and some dandy helicopter flying and jet boat chases. The bad, however, far outweighs the good. Donald Pleasence hams as perhaps never before; half of his dialog is almost unintelligible. George Peppard attempts an Australian (I think) accent, then gives it up halfway through. Lesley Ann Warren is at her most irritating. Ken Wahl is, well, Ken Wahl. The dialog is painful to hear and Hemmings' direction is largely inept. The script is not only obvious but terrible. Jokes fall flat, scenes carry no punch and continuity is virtually non-existent. According to the end credits, two men were killed piloting jet boats during the making of the film. What a waste.\",\n"," 'I cannot believe how uneducated this movie is. It\\'s like watching police academy, except it\\'s with people that have no clue of what they are talking about, and...Wait, there is a stupid robot that is supposed to be a sidekick. I can understand suspension of disbelief, but this is just complete stupidity. Not only is there no plot to this movie. It\\'s like watching someone that pretends to be a doctor, throw non-medical words around as if they were chief of staff at a major medical facility.

Apart from the James Bond-movies and a small number of comedies, they are usually pure crap. This movie is definitely one of those. The first ten minutes starts out OK, and the movie has potential at this time. Sadly, it doesn\\'t continue in this style at all. The story is about two swindlers who tries to earn a lot of money by tricking people in different ways. None of the ways they do this are funny at all. It\\'s supposed to be a comedy, but personally I didn\\'t laugh one single time during the movie. In addition, the story really sucks, especially because they threw a bit of romance on top of it. Alos, the ending is very bad, and it was just what I had expected because movies like this leave you with no surprises. If you want to see a movie about swindlers, watch \"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\" instead.',\n"," \"The comments about this movie seems to focus on the fact that it's based on a true story. What has that got to do with the quality of the movie? Nothing.<br /><br />The acting is actually good, at least the children are great, but the directing and the script is awful. Everything moves at a near-sleep-pace, and the dialogue is throughout without interesting language and lines.<br /><br />And what about the psychology between the mother and the children. She forces them to move in with a man they've never met, to a house neither she or the children has seen? Further on, when she gets sick, she claims that she all the time are forced to lie to the children, for their own good. OK it's the 80's but still.<br /><br />All and all, a very unsatisfactory movie.\",\n"," \"Some other reviewers seem to think that Woody Allen got his inspiration for Radio Days from foreign sources. I think his own childhood, similar to mine a half a generation later, was all he needed and for any further influence, he must have listened as I did to the radio ramblings of Jean Shepherd on WOR Radio back in the day.<br /><br />With the casting of young Seth Green as the protagonist and childhood Allen this was the start of a whole series of quirky roles he's played right up to this day. Allen has a good eye for detail and places that haven't changed too much since he was a child. The only difference is that he used the Rockaways instead of Brooklyn because the appearance is still the same or at least in 1987 it was. One thing that certainly hadn't changed was the elephant house at the Prospect Park Zoo where young Seth Green and his parents Michael Tucker and Julie Kavner meet one of the Quiz Kids and his parents. An all together unsatisfactory experience all around.<br /><br />The film does not have any plot so to speak, it's simply a collection of stories from just before World War II and American entry into World War II. It was the height of American radio entertainment where all you needed was imagination. Radio as we see influenced young Green/Allen in direct and subtle ways as well. Television first became commercially popular in 1947 the year I made my earthly debut. But Allen's childhood was influenced by radio. You could believe anything if the actors were good enough. Young Mr. Green believed that Wallace Shawn was a superhero because of the radio.<br /><br />The technique of the film is like Jean Shepherd's The Christmas Story and his monologues on WOR were exactly like Radio Days, just a collection of loose ramblings about the things that Shepherd remembered from his childhood in the Midwest of Hammond, Indiana. Only the Jewish humor of Woody Allen makes it distinct from a Jean Shepherd radio show being made into a film.<br /><br />Woody cast his film well, but my absolute favorite was Dianne Weist as his lovelorn Aunt Bea, destined to be a spinster like another Aunt Bea from television. The poor woman was in love with love and constantly dating a real collection of losers that never quite cut the mustard.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Jean Shepherd's nostalgic humor and The Christmas Story, you will love Radio Days. You don't have to be Jewish, honestly.\",\n"," 'Poorly-made \"blaxploitation\" crime-drama aimed squarely at the black urban market of the early 1970s. Pam Grier stars in the title role, that of a nurse who becomes a one-woman vigilante after drug-dealing thugs make Coffy\\'s little sister a junkie. Violent nonsense plods along doggedly, with canned energy and excitement; only Grier\\'s flaring temper gives the narrative a jolt (she\\'s not much of an actress here, but she connects with the audience in a primal way). Not much different from what Charles Bronson was doing at this time, the film was marketed and advertised as crass exploitation yet still managed to find a sizable inner-city audience. Today however, it\\'s merely a footnote in \\'70s film history, and lacks the wide-range appeal of other movies in this genre. *1/2 from ****',\n"," \"A May day 1938 when happen a huge rally celebrating Hitler's visit to Rome serves as the backdrop for a love story between Antoniette(Sophia Loren)married to fascist(John Vernon) and Gabriel(Marcello Mastroianni). She's a boring housewife with several sons and he's a unhappy, solitary homosexual fired from radio and pursued by the fascists. She's left alone in her home when her spouse must to attend the historical celebration. Then both develop a very enjoyable relationship in spite of their differences. The film is set on the historic meeting Fuher Hitler and Duce Mussolini along with others authorities as Count Ciano and King Victor Manuel III, describing the events by a radio-voice in off which sometimes is irritating. <br /><br />It's a romantic drama carried out with sense and sensibility. An unrelentingly passionate romance between two conflicting characters. Magnificent performances from two pros make a splendid movie well worth seeing. Of course Ruggero Macarri and Ettore Scola's sensible screenplay results in ever interesting, elaborate and sentimental. Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Pascualino De Santis. Emotive musical score by Armando Trovajoly with sensitive leitmotif. The film won deservedly Golden Globes 1978 to best Foreign Film.<br /><br />Director Scola's imagination stretches to light up the limited scenarios where are developing the drama. Usually his films take place on a few stages and are semi-theatrical. For example : ¨Le Bal¨(1982) uses a French dance-hall to illustrate the changes in society 2)¨Nuit of Varennes(1983) a stagecoach is the scenario where meet an unlikely group as Thomas Paine, Luis XVI and Marie Antoinette who fled from revolutionary Paris 3) ¨The family¨(1987)all take place in the family's grand old Roman flat; and of course 4)¨Una Giornata Particulare¨ or ¨A special day¨ where Loren and Mastroianni strikes up a marvelous relationship into their respective apartments and at the flat roof.\",\n"," \"This woman who works as an intern for a photographer goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling. So she goes to find out that her neighbor above her is a photographer. This movie could have had a great plot but then the plot drains of any hope. The problem I had with this movie is that every ten seconds, someone is snorting heroin. If they took out the scenes where someone snorts heroin, then this would be a pretty good movie. Every time I thought that a scene was going somewhere, someone inhaled the white powder. It was really lame to have that much drug use in one movie. It pulled attention from the main plot and a great story about a photographer. The lesbian stuff didn't bother me. I was looking for a movie about art. I found a movie about drug use.\",\n"," \"Was I glad to see some more of Steve and Jaime. I just loved the 1970's series. However I missed two things in all three reunion movies. First of all, I missed the 1970's look (furniture, clothes, cars, etc.) since I believe the 1970's was the ONLY decade that had style and taste (I hated the 1980's). But most importantly, where were the Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman theme music? It was a mistake not to include the themes. In fact, almost all remakes/reunion movies used the theme of the original shows. Just look at Mission Impossible, The Saint, The Wild Wild West, The Avengers, SWAT, etc. They all used the themes of the shows those movies were based upon. It wouldn't be James Bond without the James Bond theme. Yet sadly in none of the SMDM-BW reunion movies the theme from either show was present.\",\n"," 'I must have some kind of death wish to sit through Doris Wishman\\'s \"A Night To Dismember\"...very rarely have I used the term \"unwatchable\" and meant it, but in this case it\\'s absolutely true.<br /><br />Where to begin? Wishman seems to have wanted to cook up some convoluted slasher-horror movie about insane girl released back into the care of her family only for mysterious killings to begin again. But what she ended up presenting was a muddled mess of catastrophic proportions, even by her standards. Apparently much of the footage shot was lost in a fire, so when the film was edited, large chunks were missing and lots of out-takes had to be substituted. Well, it sure does show.<br /><br />Watching the movie proves to be a fractured, almost hallucinatory experience. Not a single shot has any location-sourced or ambient sound, all the soundtrack is made up of music, over-dubbed dialogue/narration, and slapped on sound effects. It\\'s like watching a silent movie that has been given a hasty \"make-do\" soundtrack by someone else. In fact it\\'s like watching a film with the sound off, in a room full of improv actors who are making up the lines as they go along, and bashing pots together to try and make matching sounds to go with the on-screen action. Then again, very few of the lines are actually spoken by the characters. A narration goes on for the entire length of the movie, explaining everything that is happening \\x96 however due to the incoherent nature of the film it\\'s the ONLY way of understanding what\\'s happening! And the music! Oh dear...Every type of stock music is laid on with a trowel, from lounge jazz to rock to Gothic chimes, and none of it EVER matches the mood of the on screen action. Maybe Wishman just threw whatever she had handy onto the turntable. And if this wasn\\'t bad enough, the film jumps, cuts, jumps ,and jumps again, in fact every few minutes there is an abrupt change of music or lines of dialogue are abruptly cut off. And I do mean EVERY few minutes. Actually there are a few scenes when the music switches styles every 2 or 3 seconds.<br /><br />There\\'s all the usual Wishman madness such as shots of feet, hideous interior décor, backs of people\\'s heads, someone moving position and the camera not realising they aren\\'t even in shot any more, etc, etc. In a new level of excitement, we get close ups of people lifting slices of cheese off a dinner plate. Some scenes look as though they were shot twice or even three times \\x96 and all the shots are included in the film, so its like some horrible demonic rewind button that forces you to see everything multiple times. Oh and before I forget to mention it, about 30-40 percent of the movie is out of focus.<br /><br />OK OK, I know there are some Doris Wishman fans out there who find this all part of her peculiar charm. The only other movies I have seen by her are the two Chesty Morgan films, and both of these are hilarious and highly recommended to any bad cinema junkie. So I do see the appeal of her unique style. But watching \"A Night To Dismember\" was nothing more than a trial. By the time I had reached the 15 minute mark I had had more than I could stand, but by some sheer force of will I managed to sit through the whole thing. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT try this at home. Utterly, utterly, mind-blowingly bad.',\n"," 'All those who criticize The Sopranos for its stereotypical portrayals of Italians haven\\'t seen anything until they\\'ve gotten a good look at this cornball gangster film which focuses on a family so irritating, you almost want them to be rubbed out.<br /><br />The parents in this clan aren\\'t so bad, but their two little boys--one a total brat, one cloyingly cutesy-poo--are insufferable, while their older good-for-nothing son and Pollyanna daughter ably compete for audience contempt. But the granddaddy of them all is, well, Granddaddy. As played by Chic Sale (in full \"Dag-nabbit!\" mode) he serves as the films moral compass, throwing in lots of diatribes about \"dang, dirty foreigners\" for good measure. If these are the good guys, it\\'s no wonder the actors of that era who played baddies became the big stars.<br /><br />Not that there are any stellar performances to be found among the criminal actors, but they at least acquit themselves better than the grating Leeds family. The incompetent police officers aren\\'t even given enough screen time to bring things down any further. Only Walter Huston, as the district attorney, elevates the cliché-riddled material in his futile attempts to breathe some levelheadedness into these dolts.<br /><br />The film deserves credit for being an early entry in what would prove to be a very popular silencing-the-witness formula, and it doesn\\'t flinch in its depiction of the hard-bitten underworld lifestyle, but there are quite simply better--and less xenophobic--examples in the genre.',\n"," \"I absolutely loved this movie. It met all expectations and went beyond that. I loved the humor and the way the movie wasn't just randomly silly. It also had a message. Jim Carrey makes me happy. :)\",\n"," \"Recap: Jamie Shannon, a mercenary, is hired by a company to go on a information gathering mission to Zangora, an African country ruled by a unstable dictator. The company is uneasy to invest in country where the situation is not under control. So, posing as a bird photographer, he goes to Zangora to collect as much information as he can. But it soon end with him being arrested, beaten to pieces and deported. The company is unhappy about the whole Zangora situation though and hires Shannon to make a coup. Shannon puts his team together. but it is not easy to plan a military operation without alerting the authorities, especially when your employer don't trust you.<br /><br />Comments: First of all, I have not read the novel, I just rented the movie expecting a good action filled war movie, as suggested by the poster for example. I was disappointed. The movie contains precious little war and almost less action. I can believe that the whole part when Shannon assembles his team works well in a book, when you can elaborate and create some suspense. In a movie, like this, when you have to cut it down to a few loosely connected scenes, all suspense is lost and all we have is a long dull waiting before the action finally begins. And when the coup starts it is a quick and easy one. Some of the potential personal vendettas that were established during his first visit is cut to a minimum, and the entire coup is without any trace of suspense. And the action was rather bad too.<br /><br />3/10\",\n"," 'So that was essentially the worst, least enjoyable movie I have ever seen. It was the least satisfying, and as the horribleness continued I wanted to walk out. I decided that wasn\\'t a viable option, so I stayed. Once I was resolute in my continuing to sit through the most dissatisfying film I\\'d ever seen I was less fidgety and distressed; I had resigned to how much the movie frustrated me. From the very beginning the complete disregard for Nicky was totally frustrating to me. Over and over he tried to do the right thing, and even tried to stand up for himself but everyone in the entire movie just walked all over him. Nothing could go right, and the movie continued without any redemption for all of the bad things that were happening, leaving me completely frustrated and unsatisfied.<br /><br />Tacy acts like a child throughout the entire movie, as perhaps only Lucille Ball can do (even that name seems like a child\\'s nickname for \"Tracy\" after they couldn\\'t pronounce the \"r\"). The tantrum she throws at the Trailer Show completely reminded me of a child (maybe me when I was younger?) getting very excited about some crazy plastic toy that had lots of bells and whistles, then begging their mother to buy it for them and explaining how many amazing ways they\\'ll use it and how this specific G.I. Joe with Kung Fu hitting action will be able to help her chop vegetables if they put a knife in it\\'s hand. She rationalizes it in so many ways that seem artificial, and Nicky, as he does throughout the movie, gives in and listens to her, though he knows it\\'s a bad idea. She is thus spoiled by her poor husband, trying to be nice and give her what she wants while knowing that things he gives into will be bad in the end.<br /><br />Even when he puts his foot down, like a mischievous child she circumvents and tricks him, which inevitably turns out badly because the thing he was standing for indeed held disastrous consequences. Much like so many comedies we can see the set up that will lead to some sort of disaster and/or pratfall, except that in this film I didn\\'t feel like the punchline was funny. Any time the irony came to light of how Tacy had screwed up and caused harm to Nicky, it wasn\\'t like some silly prank, but more of a blow to his manhood and the destruction and ungrateful treatment of something he had done to try to make her happy.<br /><br />The ending didn\\'t satisfy me after being tortured for an hour and a half by destruction, ungratefulness, deception, and bad luck. I think the movie was supposed to be cute and funny (one awkward duet does not a cute film make), but the conflict seemed too deep and destructive for me to ever let it slide by. The entire movie I was exasperated by the frustrating situations that were never funny and never redeemed. This was one of the most, probably the most, intolerable movies I have ever seen.',\n"," \"A kooky, but funny bit of diversion. You kind of have to see it from the beginning to follow what's happening, but each report to earth has it's own little joke. Pretty good special effects for a very low budget sci-fi t.v. show. It's fun to watch. Sort of in the vein of Red Dwarf, but even more low budget. For someone who's just coming in in the middle of one of the episodes, what you have to realize is that these guys are all incompetent, because they've been moved up the ladder of command, because the other officers died. Also, the main guys are from the laundry corps, which is why they have laundry in everything. If you like Red Dwarf, you'll probably like this. Slightly different t.v. concept, in that all you see is the Commander's report each day.<br /><br />It would be better if this were explained more, not just in the very beginning of the first episode, but then it was pretty hard to figure out what had happened in Red Dwarf too, if you hadn't been told.\",\n"," 'I went for this movie believing it had good ratings. Firstly, it is ridiculous that they\\'re releasing a movie originally made in 2001, seven years later in 2008 here in India. Everything in the movie looks dated. Even for 2001 the movie looks like its been made on a shoe string budget. There is a scene where a taxi hits a man to elaborate how low budget you can get. Anthony Hopkins doesn\\'t seem to know what he is doing in the film. He ends up giving a long monologue towards the end. If the film had bright sparks during that scene, I missed it as I was sleeping on my seat. Nothing about Jennifer Love Hewitt resembles a Devil. She wears ill-fitting trite clothes and scowls at random kids. As for Alec Baldwin a scene where he goes to meet Webster for the first time is not to be missed. What a waste of money! As Anthony Hopkins rightly put it, \"Go back home and write better!\"',\n"," \"Surface was one of the few truly unique shows on TV last season.

The same sea creature that had killed the main character's brother and the woman character (oceanographer) had seen.

Jan being brought back after being forced to retire because he destroyed the last facility that the device was used in and once again opened a doorway allowing alien creatures to escape!! Nicholas Lea is the young LT. of the rescue team, an early chance to see the man who would become Krycek on the X-Files. The cast continues to drop off trying to stop the creature from escaping. The effects are o.k. but there is one very good death of a rescue team member by the alien through a wall. Overall the story is entertaining.',\n"," 'The only reason I\\'m giving this a 9 is that the other kid actors who played Tadashi\\'s tormentors were not up to the job. I presume they were just kids who happened to be the right age and handy, but they were not well coached, and their scenes were a minor annoyance. <br /><br />I say not to judge this by U.S. standards because it\\'s full of ambiguities and the kinds of equivocations that Japanese culture readily embraces, and is not beholden to the black-hat/ white-hat moral constraints U.S. kids\\' films are routinely subjected to. For example, there is a preciously funny moment when Tadashi\\'s small band of yokai companions finds themselves let down and abandoned by the other yokai, and Shojo--the avuncular Kirin herald--does what many a stressed-out Japanese adult would do. Hint: this would not happen in a Disney film. This picture also has the best product placement for beer you will ever see in a kids\\' movie. <br /><br />Early on, there\\'s a moment where a school teacher smacks a couple of bullies on the head with her attendance book. There was a TV commercial in Japan a couple years before this movie came out. It was a stop-motion clay animation about a kid who\\'s depressed and playing guitar and singing the blues in his room. His mother yells at him from downstairs to shut up. Then, someone gives him a candy bar and he cheers up and sings a happy tune, but his mother comes in and tells him to shut up again and gives him a dope slap that leaves a dent in his forehead. I mention this commercial, because it was considered funny, and I didn\\'t hear any objections to it while I was there. There is a lot more bloodshed and physical cruelty on screen in \"The Great Yokai War\" than one would find in a Disney movie. As a parent, if this were a U.S. film, I would be up in arms about such things, although not necessarily the moral lessons drawn at the end of the picture, which, of course, are also not black and white. Since it\\'s a Japanese movie, I accept that those cultural norms allow for imagery that would not get past the standards and practices cops in a U.S. production. However, I\\'d probably be a little uneasy taking young kids to see it without giving them some sort of pre-show briefing and/or post-show debriefing about the violence and other off- color stuff, or I\\'d wait till they\\'re older to show it to them.',\n"," \"<br /><br />If you like Troma's kind of silly, off beat, absurd humor then I'm quite sure you'll really enjoy a whole lot of scenes in this flick as well.

Our hero uses his new found powers to beat the crap out of some local small time crooks in various entertaining ways, but it turns out he really owns his powers to the fact that he was chosen to fight the Evil One, who is about to take over the world. He is reluctant to accept this responsibility at first, but a Japanese chick kicks some sense into him and then goes on to teach him how to use his new found skills properly.>\",\n"," \"There's not really that much wrong with Crash of the Moons. Basically it's a few episodes of Rocky Jones, Space Ranger merged into a film. It is extremely dated, however. Winky's treatment of Vena is a good example of this. One has to remember that it was geared to be shown to children in the 1950's. In this respect, it succeeds. If you like children's sci-fi from the 1950's, go ahead and take a look at it. You'll see John Banner in a pre-sgt. Schultz role. He does a pretty good job in it. All in all, I'd give it a 6 out of 10.

He then realizes that maybe everything he is doing isn't worth all he has lost, (i.e. his family, his safety, his job). This film was a real controversial masterpiece of modern times. It was nominated for 7 Academy Awards, and though I agree with giving Best Picture, Actor, and Director to American Beauty, this film should have won something, possably Best Screenplay.\",\n"," \"First of all, Blythe Danner doesn't look anywhere NEAR old enough to play Capshaw's daughter (and in fact she isn't -- only ten years apart).<br /><br />I understand this is supposed to be one of those magical, Moonstruck type supernatural romances but this is beyond the pale. Very, very weak in terms of acting, script and direction. <br /><br />The only one who really shines here is Ellen DeGeneres, who makes this film watchable -- if not really believable herself as she's cast as a bit of a heterosexual sex hound. But endearing nonetheless. Actually, DeGeneres and the skin shots of the young guy Capshaw dallies with together make this watchable. But no one can really tell if Capshaw is really in love with the young guy or not; neither the script nor her acting pull it together for us and we're left to wonder how she really feels.\",\n"," \"Wing Commander was one of the first real interactive movies when the third installment was released in 94, it pushed the boundaries for graphics, acting and storyline into uncharted heights for a video game. Critics argued that the game was just a movie in disguise, now 5 years later the movie is finally here.<br /><br />I had fairly high expectations for this movie, since Chris Roberts the creator of the original game series, spearheaded the project. The storyline of the games could have easily been adapted to fit a full length movie, but instead they opted to change almost everything. <br /><br />The acting isn't great, although it's not downright awful - it's close. The characters are very stale, making it hard for viewers to relate to them. A central character could be killed off and you wouldn't really care, the emotional flow from the screen to the viewer is virtually nonexistent.<br /><br />As almost every one else has pointed out, the ships! they look like WWII fighters, and the carrier looks like a submarine - what's up with that ???<br /><br />I can only think of one positive thing in this movie: the state of the ships, no chrome and gloss, they looked beat up and worn out, kind of like the millennium falcon in Star Wars... but that's it.<br /><br />Wing Commander stands as one of the few epic computer games. As a movie on the other hand, it's not worth remembering.\",\n"," \"Totally forgettable. Specially because of the weak acting. This is the first movie I've seen with Dax Shepard. To my surprise, he's been around since the late 90's. I thought he was a newcomer, since his acting was so bland. I could say the same about Liv Tyler. Although I've seen her do well in other movies, she gave Clare Cooper a strange personality. Liv is not the kind of actress that will give the character a fiery, emotional personality like Diane Keaton would be able to, but it was pretty strange to see her say her lines in whisper mode. It seemed that altogether there simply wasn't a very good chemistry going on between the actors, and I think Diane Keaton sensed that as well. She's a fantastic actress, but seemed just a bit over the top in this movie. It felt like she just wanted to get this movie over as soon as possible. I wouldn't blame her.\",\n"," 'Because of a relentless linearity in the plot, it would be impossible to comment on \"Plata Quemada\" without creating spoilers. Viewers need to realize that fact at the beginning before reading this or indeed any review.<br /><br />What one has here is classic tragedy played against the background of an inherently tragic reality. Although most reviewers tend to cite analogous story lines from films like \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" \"Scarface,\" or any one of several films based on the Leopold-Loeb case, that line of thinking leaves one with less than meets the eye. We know from the start where this thing is going, so one may fairly discard any pretension of suspense and concentrate instead on character portrayal and other broad strokes of the cinematic artist\\'s brush.<br /><br />This is, in short, a brilliant film whether or not it \"goes\" anywhere or stumbles on the way. The acting and direction are at worst very respectable, the editing competent, and the visuals and soundtrack really take the breath away. But the centerpiece of it all is how a time and place are captured as representative of decadent society, and how the redemptive power of love can infuse human existence even within such a violent milieu.<br /><br />Cry for Argentina, indeed! The tragedy of Nene and Angel is all the more poignant in that their attempt to flee comes at a time just prior to the imploding of that sad country. Their ascent into self-realization contrasts boldly with the broader descent of social and political institutions that had failed them. It is easy to quibble that their own characters are flawed; such flaws are, however, the very essence of their humanity. Even the otherwise despicable Cuervo is ultimately revealed as worthy of that simple recognition.<br /><br />In short, it is no wonder that Los Mellizos are legend. Whether the film lives up to its claim of being fundamentally a true story is really beside the point. Score 10 of 10.',\n"," '**WARNING - SPOILERS AHEAD**<br /><br />Short version: this movie sucks. Long version: as somebody else wrote, the hole is in the plot line. Or better, there are lots of holes, but mainly:<br /><br />a) Martin has a perfect alibi, yet he\\'s the suspect from the beginning and nobody believes him. But, since they find him (dead) with the key, he MUST be guilty. And Liz must surely be rather strong, if she can plunge him in the river so easily. And rather quick, to put the key in his pocket without anybody (in the audience) noticing. Martin dies only a few yards away from Liz\\'s house, but no one seems to care about that.<br /><br />b) Hello? Did anybody tell the psychologist there were THREE dead bodies in the cell, one of which with his head crushed? How come the police acts as if nothing happened and no one ever talks about it? How come Liz was never questioned SERIOUSLY about these deaths? The first version of the story ends with everybody coming out of the hole happy and smiling, but the psychologist seems to believe it.<br /><br />c) the hole is abandoned since WW II, but there still is electricity. The hole has an emergency exit which can be locked from outside, in order to make it completely unuseful. The door of the hole has a glass part, but nobody tries to break it. <br /><br />d)The door key magically appeared in Martin\\'s pockets some time before, because he won\\'t let us know who gave it to him, and if we knew it, that would mean that someone else knew about the existence of the hole, and that would have made it too complex for the writers.<br /><br />e) Nobody in the school noticed that the boys didn\\'t go to Wales, and their families didn\\'t notice they didn\\'t come home. It took at least three days to understand that there was something wrong.<br /><br />f) Liz is so convincing when she talks, that everybody instantly believes her: see the ending. <br /><br />g) Think about this: when Liz came out, the door was OPEN. If Martin was on holiday, who the hell could open it without a key?<br /><br />I think that\\'s enough to explain why the movie doesn\\'t work.<br /><br />A thriller is a dangerous game: if you want to play it with the audience, you must be sure you can handle it.

There was a tasteful suggestion of a sex scene. The goriness was in line with expectations, not overstated.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I found the action straightforward enough.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />The new Puppet Master, Dr. Magrew (George Peck) is experimenting to discover the methods the original Puppet Master, Andre Toulon, used to create semi-living puppets. Assistants, who first carve the 444 wooden pieces that go into a puppet, can be transformed by a lightening-like effect into the inner workings of a puppet. (The director used this idea later in his \"Voodoo Academy.\") The movie starts with Dr. Magrew disposing the results of a failed experiment and finding a new person, Robert \"Tank\" Winsley (Josh Green), to be the new carver. The problem is that Dr. Magrew\\'s daughter, Jane (Emily Harrison), takes a romantic interest in Robert. Bully Joey Carp (Michael Guerin) wants his way with Jane and isn\\'t too fond of Robert.

Lightening effects were too pervasive.

Thank God Nelson had more sense to drop a large hunk of semi-soft cheese into the middle of an outstanding masterpiece. Such a cliched and trite twist would have aboslutely ruined the film for me. Obviously, Nelson did not want to pedestrianise her masterpiece and so consciously steered away from such a soap-opera style conclusion.<br /><br />Penn's performance is highly commendable - more Rainman than Forest Gump.

However this film made me laugh so much with my friends that I should forgive its uselessness and its ugliness. We had a lot of fun. There are two sequences in Paganini Horror (one at the beginning, the other close to the ending) so silly and dumb that you can't do nothing but laugh.. unfortunately the rest of the movie can be quietly trashed away, its boringness is something unbelievable (especially during the music scenes).

The script by Constantine & Ivan Chachornia along with 'additional material' by an uncredited Will Huston is rubbish, it starts out as it means to go on as for no reason whatsoever a group of kids murder Tommy who despite taking ugly pills didn't seem like such a bad kid, did he? Why murder him? Why so openly in front of other people & in the middle of the daytime? I must admit those questions kept bothering me right throughout the rest of the film & annoyingly they were never answered... The rest of this silly film isn't much better as why would a group of friends suddenly decide it would be 'fun' to dig a dead body up & perform a magical ritual intended to bring it back to life? Why? Does that sound like fun to you? When was the last time you said to yourself 'I'm bored so I'm going to dig a dead body up & try to bring it back to life'? People just don't behave like this & yes I accept the 'it's only a film' argument but this was meant to be a serious credible horror film set in reality with 'real' people, don't make me laugh because Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings is anything but. The film has an OK pace, there are one or two half decent scenes but the character's & dialogue are poor & overall it's very predictable.<br /><br />Director Burr ruins what could have been a decent sequel, the special effects are a step down from the original. Pumpkinhead himself looks worse than the original, he doesn't seem to have any colour or texture almost as if he was unfinished & the guy in the rubber monster suit doesn't help. I though Pumpkinhead was poorly shot & didn't work. It tries to create some atmosphere but it's all so silly & whats with the constant flashing lights when Pumpkinhead appears? There is one hilarious bit when a dead woman comes back to life & she sits up in bed & all these lights suddenly shine on her & she starts speaking in a daft voice to the local Sheriff who begins to interrogate her! Not a good creative decision, one amongst many I might add. The gore is OK, there are some severed limbs, someone has their head torn off, two lovers are impaled on a fence railing (Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981) anyone?), someone has their face pecked by chickens & there are some gory gunshot wounds.<br /><br />Technically the film is OK but nothing stands out, it's well made apart from some lacklustre unfinished looking creature effects. The cast don't distinguish themselves, did you know that Roger Clinton who played Mayor Bubba is in actual fact ex US president Bill Clinton's brother? Well, now you do.<br /><br />Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings is a poor film, it follows a great film & does nothing but turn in a teenagers on the run from a monsters type film. Watch the far superior original again instead, definitely not recommended. For some bizarre reason this inspired a video game called Bloodwings: Pumpkinhead's Revenge (1995) while two more film sequels have been made recently Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes (2006) & Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud (2007).\",\n"," 'Alexander Desplat, the splendid composer of \"Birth\" starts us off in a such away that I though I was in for a real treat. Then Nicole Kidman, with her astonishingly beautiful, intense, intelligent face. Elegant fades to black, scrumptious cinematography. Then what? As soon as 10 year old boy makes his appearance telling her, them and us who he is, the film stops and dwells on that point without knowing where to go. Round and round and round again. Among the writers of \"Birth\" is listed the great Jean-Claude Carriere with amazing titles to his credit. I don\\'t believe for a minute that he had anything to do with the appalling structure of this mess. The most frustrating feature of this film is that it promises a memorable journey within the first ten minutes and then ignores it, ignore us it cheated us.

I have just seen this on VHS, together with the first part of the story, \"Gong woo ching\" (\"Rich and Famous\"), also 1987. (The poster and 2 stills featured on the page are for a 4-DVD set of movies starring Rod Perry (The Black Gestapo), Fred Williamson (Black Cobra 2), Richard Lawson (Black Fist). The fourth movie is called \"The Black Six\"). Strangely, while the characters retain their original names in \"Rich and Famous\", in \"Black Vengeance\" Chow Yun-Fat\\'s character is named Eddie Shaw, Alex Man (Man Tze Leung) is Harry, and Andy Lau is called Johnny. Also confusing is the fact that 1994 is given as the copyright dates on both films. Perhaps that was the year they were American-dubbed. According to the release dates given on IMDb \"Tragic Hero\" was released before \"Rich and Famous\". Was there any reason for releasing the sequel first? Despite some users\\' comments, I enjoyed these films, although they aren\\'t among CYF\\'s best such as \"The Killer\" and \"Hard-Boiled\" which are truly astonishing. However,if one day I come across a 2-DVD set of \"Rich and Famous\" and \"Tragic Hero\" I won\\'t hesitate to buy it. Hopefully, these comments about \"Black Vengeance\" clear up, which was also for me, a mystery as to where it belonged in Chow Yun-Fat\\'s filmography.',\n"," \"CAVITE is an example of ultimate independent film, with a very short budget, a very simple concept, an exotic locale, a minimal cast, and a hand-held camera.<br /><br />The story is simple: Adam (Ian Gamazon) is called home to the Phillipines because of a family crisis. Instead of his family picking him up, he finds himself forced to follow instructions of a man claiming to have his family. There's no clear reason for the abduction, or what makes Adam a target; all Adam really knows is that his every move is watched, and the kidnappers have no regard for their victims.<br /><br />As Adam follows the obscure instructions, and the obstacles in his way, the audience can't help but be caught up in his plight. The hand held camera and jumpy editing style enhances the sense of desperation and time. The scenes of urban Phillipines, particular the markets and the squatter holdings are a vivid cacophony.<br /><br />Co-directors and Co-writers Neill Dela Llana and Ian Gamazon have done an outstanding job of making the most out of limited means. The economy of the film makes it both intimate and discomfiting, as Adam is an everyman who only wants his family safe and instead is completely at the whim of an omniscient tormentor.<br /><br />CAVITE is an absolute must for anyone who has an interest in film, as storytelling, in it's structure, and as an art form.\",\n"," 'This BBC series is excellent.

Aussie Park Boyz could not possibly be any worse - the acting is beyond terrible, the plot is basically a poor Warriors knock-off, and the filmmakers clearly have no idea about ethnic gangs in Australia (an Irish gang in twenty-first century Sydney! The last time any Irish gangs were in Australia was about a hundred years ago in the time of the tinkers!) But because it's about ethnic rivalry, one of four topics guaranteed to be a success in Australian cinema (along with struggling families, minority groups, and the biography of a famous Australian) it won multiple academy awards. I've always suspected that Australian critics will lap up any rubbish that deals with these issues, but part of me thought, or at least hoped, that they had their limits. This film proves otherwise. So to all you Australian aspiring film-makers out there, don't bother putting thought into your film or choosing people who can actually act, or even getting your facts right - just write a script about some poor family trying to make ends meet, or someone of a foreign race coming to Australia and having to deal with racial prejudice and stereotypes, or, if you want to take a leaf out of these people's book, some ethnic gang fighting some other ethnic gang that isn't actually plausible in the period the film is set, and your film will win five academy awards regardless of how pathetic it is!\",\n"," \"This is a really funny film, especially the second, third and fourth time you watch it.

Subsquent viewings of the film only make it better, and it is overall just absolutely heartbreaking.

It is a pity, as the film is highly enjoyable - though unusual in many respects: it combines extremely funny scenes with very serious ones; there are practically two settings only: the street at night and the jail; and the cast is limited to seven players: two cameos (wizened Richard Hamilton, and intriguing Norman Reedus as the drowned man), two supporting ones (lovely Karen Sillas and seldom-seen Bruce Norris as the pair looking unsuccessfully for privacy); and three main roles : reliable William Sadler, excellent as the police sergeant; bland-faced promising Alessandro Nivola as the hero, and strikingly beautiful (and good actress) Brooke Langton, climaxing the film.

It was also the third of seven Karloff/Lugosi features. In this entry the dominant role goes to Boris Karloff.<br /><br />Through specially designed astronomical equipment, Dr. Janos Rukh (Karloff) demonstrates to colleagues Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi), Sir Frances Stevens (Walter Kingsford), his wife Lady Stevens (Beulah Bondi) and their nephew Ronald Drake (Frank Lawton), that a meteorite containing a powerful element, landed on the African continent many millions of years in the past. Rukh impresses his guests who invite him to accompany them on an expedition to Africa to find the mysterious element.<br /><br />Rukh goes off on his own and discovers the place where the meteorite landed and the element which he names \"Radium X\". Due to Rukh\\'s long absences, his comely young wife Diana (Frances Drake) becomes attracted to Drake and the two fall in love. Meanwhile Rukh becomes contaminated by Radium X to the point that anyone he touches will die instantly. The contamination causes his skin to emit a bright glow in the dark.<br /><br />Rukh goes to Benet for help. Benet devises an antidote which if taken on a daily basis, will provide temporary immunity to the element. Unfortuneatly, the deadly element also affects Rukh\\'s brain, slowly turning him into a vindictive murderer.<br /><br />While Rukh is continuing his work, Sir Frances takes news of the discovery back to France. Diana and Ronald accompany him. When Benet informs him of this action, Rukh accuses the party of betraying him and his discovery and secretly plans his revenge. When he returns to France he learns of the healing power of Radium X as he cures his mother\\'s (Violet Kemble Cooper) blindness and of Benet\\'s work in curing the maladies of his patients.<br /><br />But Rukh\\'s madness intensifies.

Karloff\\'s film all the way.',\n"," 'This four-hour miniseries production is about two hours longer than necessary, primarily because the filmmakers seemed not to have a clear idea how to adapt a novel to the screen. They seemed not to know what should be kept in and what might safely be left out. The film opens with Sir Walter reading from the Peerage book that is his primary solace in his troubles. This introduces the family - all of whom we get to know intimately over the next four hours anyway - but serves little other purpose. Similarly, the scenes where the Musgroves lament \"poor Richard\" serve no purpose but to drag the story down. Some of Austen\\'s actual dialogue is allocated to different characters and some of her narrative is recycled as dialogue that falls awkwardly from the tongues of the characters. There is some fill-in dialogue, too, and this is uniformly dreadful. The scene where Charles Hayter is boring Henrietta with his concerns about getting Dr. Shirley\\'s curacy was only barely interesting as narrative in the book; as a scene in this production, it is stultifying The scene on the Cobb, when Louisa falls and is \"taken up lifeless!\", is entirely without urgency, and I wondered whether Wentworth\\'s line \"Is there nobody to help me?\" might have been directed at the writers, as well as the other actors.<br /><br />This production often looks and feels like a play that has been filmed, rather than an actual film, and this is most evident in the acting, which is the opposite of subtle: booming delivery of lines, exaggerated gestures, and actors who have no idea what to do with their hands, feet, or faces when they are not speaking their lines. Charles Musgrove stands in his parlour, feet shoulder width apart, and appears to project to the balcony (if there were one) when speaking to the other people in the room with him. Louisa Musgrove\\'s face, when not actively simpering or giggling, seems to be in confused repose. Louisa is a giddy, giggly, ditzy creature, and I did not for a moment believe that Wentworth would be interested in her. <br /><br />The costumes are a mixed bunch, but mostly awful, and Anne Elliot\\'s green tartan gown is quite possibly the most hideous alleged period costume ever devised. We are given the dates at the beginning of the show - it is the late 1790\\'s or perhaps very early 1800s - and yet many of the costumes seem to be of Victorian design, and thus about 60 years too early! The hair is just so wrong that I won\\'t even mention it here. Except to say that I won\\'t mention it. :-)<br /><br />This production does do some things right, however. Mrs. Smith is given her proper importance, and her history with Mr. Elliot, his dissipation and his intrigues, are fully addressed. I was also pleased to see the fleshed out \"reconciliation\" scenes with Anne and Frederick at the end, which are precious reward for the reader but were glossed over in the 1995 production.<br /><br />If you love the book Persuasion, and even vaguely like the 1995 movie, don\\'t waste a moment (or a penny) on this production; you will find it sorely wanting.',\n"," 'I saw Heartland when it was first released in 1980 and I have just seen it again. It improves with age. Heartland is not just for lovers of \"indie\" films. At a time when most American films are little more than cynical attempts to make money with CGI, pyrotechnics, and/or vulgarity, Heartland holds up as a slice of American history. It is also a reminder of how spoiled most of us modern, urbanized Americans are.<br /><br />Nothing in this film is overstated or stagey. No one declaims any Hollywood movie speeches. The actors really inhabit their roles. This really feels like a \"small\" film but really it is bigger than most multizillion-dollar Hollywood productions.<br /><br />The film is based on the lives of real people. In 1910, Elinore Randall (Conchata Ferrell, who has never done anything better than this), a widow with a 7-year-old daughter Jerrine (Megan Folsom), is living in Denver but wants more opportunities. She advertises for a position as housekeeper. The ad is answered by Clyde Stewart (Rip Torn, one of our most under-appreciated actors), a Scots-born rancher, himself a widower, with a homestead outside of Burnt Fork, Wyoming. Elinore accepts the position (seven dollars a week!) and moves up to Wyoming with her daughter. She and her daughter move into Stewart\\'s tiny house on the property. It is rolling, treeless rangeland, a place of endless vistas where the silence is broken only by the sounds made by these people and their animals. It\\'s guaranteed to make a person feel small. The three characters go for long periods without seeing another human soul. What is worse, Stewart turns out to be taciturn to the point of being almost silent. \"I can\\'t talk to the man,\" Elinore complains to Grandma Landauer. \"You\\'d better learn before winter,\" replies Grandma. Grandma (Lilia Skala) is one of the only two other characters who are seen more than fleetingly. She came out to Wyoming from Germany with her husband many years before and runs her ranch alone now that she is also widowed. Grandma is their nearest neighbor (and the local midwife) and still she lives ten miles away! The other supporting character is Jack the hired hand (Barry Primus).<br /><br />Elinore\\'s routine (and her employer\\'s) is one of endless, backbreaking labor, where there are no modern conveniences and where everything must be made, fixed or done by hand. This is the real meat of the film: Watching the ordinary life of these ranchers as they struggle against nature to wrest a living from the land. But despite the constant toil and fatigue, Elinore is always looking for other opportunities. She learns that the tract adjacent to Stewart\\'s is unclaimed. Impulsively, she files a claim on the property (twelve dollars, or almost two weeks\\' pay!), meaning that if she lives on it (and she must actually live there) and works it for ten years, she will get the deed to it. Naturally, Stewart learns what she has done. With merciless logic, he points out that with no money, no livestock, no credit, and no assets, she has no chance of succeeding. He then offers a solution: He proposes marriage. The stunned Elinore realizes that this is the only real alternative, and accepts.<br /><br />We think that Stewart\\'s proposal is purely Machiavellian---he wants the land and the free labor---but we see that, in fact, he is genuinely fond of Elinore, and they grow together as a couple. She becomes pregnant; she goes into labor in the middle of a midwinter blizzard; Clyde travels for hours on horseback through the storm the ten miles to Grandma\\'s and the ten miles back, only to announce that Grandma wasn\\'t there. This is more like real life than is pleasant, folks. Elinore has the baby all by herself, with no help whatsoever. Their son is still an infant when he gets sick and dies. They lose half their livestock to the vicious winter. They struggle on. The last sequence in the film is supposed to be optimistic: The birth of a calf. Clyde calls Elinore urgently to help him deliver the calf. Instead of being head first, the calf is in a footling breech presentation. He and Elinore must physically pull the calf out of the birth canal. There is no CGI, animatronics, trickery, fakery or special effects: What you see is what happened, folks: A calf is born on a bed of straw in a wooden barn by lamplight. With that, the film does not so much end as simply stop, leaving the viewer unsatisfied, but after a while you appreciate the film as a whole, not just for its ending.<br /><br />This little gem rewards patience and thoughtfulness. It will be watchable long after most of the films of the last generation have long been forgotten.',\n"," 'The only thing in \"Sudden Death\" that outdoes the amount of non-stop action is the incredible number of plot holes. What with that, and the sheer amount of contrivances, one could hardly call what\\'s left a storyline. To say the screenplay has borrowed from the \"Die Hard\" premise would be to make the world\\'s most blatant understatement!<br /><br />Here we have a troubled hero working in the huge Pittsburgh Indoor Ice Rink as a fire Marshall. On the night of the seventh game of the finals series he gets tickets so he can treat his estranged children to the deciding game, and of course spend a little time with them. Also catching the match, but for political reasons, is the Vice President of the United States (Raymond J. Barry). When a bunch of incredibly well organised mercenaries capture the V.P.\\'s box and demand hundreds of millions in government money, our hero Darren McCord has his plans more than slightly put out.<br /><br />Each time a new one of these formula flicks is made it seems that all we get in the way of innovation is nastier bad guys, and more and more spectacular and gruesome ways in which the good guys dispose of them. Director Hyams and his screenwriter have gone over the top (not that this is an original sin) in trying to make us loathe the wicked terrorists. The horrible baddies go about shooting the secret service, the security and the civilians (both old and young) with gay abandon, and with scant regard for the relative threat of each victim.<br /><br />Van Damme engages in plenty of fisty-cuffs and gunplay, heroics and death defying stunts. The script asks little of the musclebound European. Almost everyone else has walk-ons apart from Powers Boothe, who seriously overdoes his under written, shallow role as the cruelest, meanest old ring leader there ever was.<br /><br />There\\'s a lot of clever cinematography, and enough explosive special f/x to keep anyone awake.

Shearer\\'s Marie is a sympathetic character, a victim of her circumstances. She is not the self-indulgent Marie with a taste for extravagance, and a patronizing attitude towards the people. She doesn\\'t utter the phrase often attributed to her, \"Let them eat cake.\" Instead, she is the victim of Court politics and intrigue designed to falsely implicate her as an insensitive, distant, and selfish monster.<br /><br />Robert Morley is perfect in his role as the inept king who ascends to the throne at an early age, and probably lacked the smarts and the intestinal fortitude to perform the duties of a monarch no matter what age he had become king. Even though history paints him as inept and weak, the movie gives a heart to this unfortunate man (as it does for Marie) that evokes compassion and understanding. Although Marie\\'s lover only existed in the tongue of gossip, the sequences with Tyrone Power added a passionate romantic flavor to the story, a definite plus with its dramatic contrast to the understated Marie/Louis relationship.<br /><br />The story of the downfall of these two is intelligently and logically constructed with a fine script, an enthusiastic cast that all shine in their roles, and an uncommonly well scripted dramatization.

Then I found this production with a flawless performance by Kathleen Turner as the evil stepmother and was blown away by the phantasmagorical essence of this fantasy story that has cast me under its spell since childhood.<br /><br />We all know the story of Cinderella, a young girl who's father died and was dominated by her wicked stepmother and stepdaughters and longs to go to the ball for one last chance for freedom. But this plot line takes a different twist in the classic Fairy Tale by causing Cinderella (whose real name is Zizola, and is only called Cinderella by her family because of her slavery) to be trapped in a situation of her father (who still lives) slowly losing himself to a dominant wife who manipulates him into playing favorites with his wife and step-daughters against his own and tries to poison him. Thus, Zizola goes out to save her father by stopping her stepmother from finding another suitor at the ball by distracting the men who come her way. There, the bored Prince Valiant has a change of heart from his dull life and falls in love with the mysterious lady in the strange dress (forged by a water nymph named Mab) with rose petals for slippers. <br /><br />What drew me to this film most of all was it's original take on the old Fairy Tale that none can compare to. It does not weave a web of lies like most Cinderella stories, it does not ignore any reason as to why Cinderella would want to attend the ball and nor does it show a shallow side to the Prince as the Disney version did. Instead it shows more of Cinderella's selfless heart more than any other production and the artwork is simply stunning! The costumes are all beautifully made, especially Zizola's sapphire blue ballgown to match the Marcella Plunkett's fantastical beauty and soft, spirit-like voice. <br /><br />I would highly suggest this film for anyone who is interested in a dream-like sequence of the classic Fairy Tale with an interesting twist. My only problem is that the producers and director did not make a full collection of other Fairy Tales with this same element and the fact that the film is now out of print.\",\n"," \"Note: I will reveal a key part of the plot, but if you've looked at the DVD cover or any promotional material, you'll already know it.<br /><br />This movie seems to have been written by an eleven-year-old who isn't very bright and was probably very tired when he wrote it. The writer doesn't know the difference between a chemical and an organism.<br /><br />Forget the fact the the UN and the NSA seem to be running the show in Hungary. Forget the fact that when these master intelligence agents go chasing after someone whose mere touch will kill you in about a minute they don't wear protective gear (not even gloves). These are quibbles in the context of this movie. In the scientific world within this story, 2+2=6.34 and gravity goes sideways.<br /><br />The fact is that the people in this movie do not (with a few exceptions) behave the way human beings behave. Almost every time a character responds to something it is inappropriate. The love story (of course there is one) makes soap opera scripts seem like Shakespeare.<br /><br />I can't believe we wasted a free movie rental on this thing.\",\n"," 'Sometimes there are movies that just don\\'t deserve to be called movies and sometimes there are cameramen who just deserve to be shot.

What a shame that in the UK we can find examples such as \\'Avatar\\' (name of many a video game) where brain dead attempts are made to imitate so many films - and console games beloved of girlfriendless teens - that themselves are cheap photocopies of clichés abound like testosterone fuelled kangaroos.

This should have seemed a tired, sad concept in 1993, never mind 2003. Ah, but there is more - the \\'ultimate virus\\' has already caused planes to crash, infected the air traffic control centre, etc. It has been developed by a \\'child genius\\' and manifests itself as a scantily clad, athletic, mammary jiggling discount Lara Croft imitator who does a great line in snarling and cod martial arts moves straight out of the playground - the living product of adolescent fantasy. Oh, and she is accompanied by \\'Predator\\' like sound effects to emphasise her remarkable powers.<br /><br />The whole thing has a \\'futuristic\\' vision of stunning originality - the Lloyds building filtered with AfterEffects to look somewhat green. The budget does really show - which in this day and age should not. On the whole, a pointless mess of cheese, ham and cliché that Roger Corman would have left on the cutting room floor in his most shameless, desperate moments.

This same plot has been played over and over again, but what made it worse was that the major plot hole was the whole story on how to kill the baddies...The writer could have done so much more with the entire concept, but seemed that he or she did not have their heart in it and wanted to close the movie as soon as it started.<br /><br />Overall, too much hype but not able to deliver.',\n"," \"That was great fun!

It had some parallels to The Shining in that the son/daughter had a mysterious friend, who apparently can make things haywire. There was another parallel with the dead women in the bathtub in both movies and the father getting crazy and going after an authority figure with an axe. This movie really kept me on the edge of me seat, and thats why I have to give it a seven. However, I had a hunch about 10-15 prior to the end that David Callaway(De Niro) was going to get killed. However, I thought Emily was going to be the one to kill him, not the lady. I figured Emily was going to stab him in the backside in the cave scene.',\n"," 'I can honestly say that there was nothing about this movie that bothered me.

One has seen a light in the distance (in the jungle) and all except one go to find what it is, and it\\'s an old ruin with a lighted lantern. They make a fire and settle down & to pass the time, they tell each other ghost stories, and most of the film is the visualization of those stories, although from time to time someone must wander away from the fire for some reason or another, and all seem to be meeting with unexpected demises. The stories themselves range from creepy and eerie to somewhat whimsical and silly at times, but all are fairly effective and keep the viewer\\'s interest. No singing and dancing in this film, except with the opening and closing credits; this one is all about keeping the scary atmosphere. There is sort of a \"pretty boy/pretty girl\" cast, but at least they\\'re not smoking joints or swilling beer around the campfire like in American films. Overall this is a pretty enjoyable and effective film, and I\\'d recommend it to anyone seeking something different to watch. 8 out of 10.',\n"," \"This film is absolutely lovely! I watched this film a few years ago with my little brother, who was 8 years old at the time and only watched Disney. However, he was hooked on this film. It shows everything that is good and pure about Ireland. It is a bit similar to 'Fairytale, a true story' but is so pure and lovely. I have just spent an hour searching for this film (as I'd forgotten the name) just so that I can buy it for myself, and I would recommend it to people. I challenge you not to feel touched by this magical film! The girl (Fiona) is sent to live with her grandparents in a remote part of Ireland, which overlooks the deserted Islad of Roan Inish. There are legends relating to this island which she learns, including the fact that her baby brother disappeared. She see's a small boy on the island, and is sure that the seals are bringing him up as their own. This begins her search for the truth.\",\n"," 'I am a very tolerant viewer. I enjoy almost every film I see, even if it is not the best film ever made. However, this motion picture directly challenges the tolerance that I have for filmed entertainment. \"Strategic Command\" is easily THE WORST film I have ever had the misfortune to watch. It is an almost identical clone to the vastly superior \"Executive Decision\" with elements from \"The Rock\" thrown in to try and (In a pathetic attempt if I may add.) to distinguish it from the aforementioned films. Although there are some differences in the film (The jet that docks with the 747 in \"Strategic Command\" is an SR-71 while the jet in \"Executive Decision\" is an F-117.), these differences are not enough to keep the film from being a mediocre imitation. Special effects are mostly poorly executed, although some of the matte shots did seem convincing. Parts of the film where some of the bad guys and a good guy vomits looked like they put an Alka Seltzer tablet in their mouth and would spit the foam out at the right time to emulate vomit. Some of the footage of the F-16s, both interior and exterior, were taken directly from the film \"Iron Eagle\" so as to save money on the limited production budget. Acting is another weak point, with people playing their parts too hard. As a result, the characters become unconvincing and lifeless. The only good actor in the film was Paul Winfield. I was shocked to see how low Mr. Winfield sunk, his acting talent could\\'ve served in better films than this. The film\\'s only saving grace is the musical score, sounding better than most other low budget and even some high budget films. However, it seems that the composer was trying to emulate and, in some parts of the suite, combine the styles Jerry Goldsmith and James Horner. Most of the suite, although is surprisingly good for a no-name composer, is mostly unoriginal and uninspired. Overall, \"Strategic Command\" is a mediocre facsimilie of \"Executive Decision\". This is a film that deserves to stay in a vault and rot away. The video does not deserve to be purchased, even five dollars for this movie is highway robbery! This picture can, at the very best, serve as a rental, but there are better choices at the video store. Besides, this film is nothing but two hours of your life that can be spent watching a better film. After seeing this review, your brain should be giving an excellent \"Strategic Command\" to steer clear of this stinker! - Reinhart',\n"," 'Seeing the names of the starring actors (Statham, Snipes and Phillippe) I thought that the movie should at least be decently funny or interesting.

And when you have that, than no one can help you, not Statham, not Wesley Snipes...not even John McClane could save this movie :-) It could be cool for the kids, if they aren\\'t over 12 years of age, because they don\\'t care so much about the story, and there are some big explosions in the movie.',\n"," 'I don\\'t mind that this takes heavy inspiration from Hitchcock\\'s \"Rear Window.\" I mind that it\\'s nowhere near as good.

Without commenting and taking a side on the US Foreign Policy, the process of Extraordinary Rendition involves taking persons suspected of terrorist activities to a foreign country, an opposite to an extradition if you wish, to a place where torture is not a crime but a means to illicit information. Instead of staining your soil with blood of potentially innocent parties, you do so on foreign land where such tactics are accepted interrogation techniques.<br /><br />Naturally, given the severity of the tactics and attempts at breaking down a person, sometimes you would get what you want once you pass the resistance, or get nothing, or worst of all, get a confession just because the mind has been broken to the point that the subject will agree to whatever you say. It's an ugly process, and what better way to do it when you're the champion human rights, giving the nod to use whatever means necessary in the name of protecting more lives, in an age where information is key to the battle against terror, and doing so in a country where probably the rights record is questionable.<br /><br />Rendition is this year's Syriana, though in the run up to the new year we do have a number of political thriller contenders to take that crown, with Rendition first of all, followed by the Robert Redford movie Lions for Lambs, starring Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep (again, though now on the other side of the fence), and The Kingdom with Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Garner, though this one would probably turn out to be more action driven. Directed by Gavin Hood, who did Tsotsi and will be helming the new Wolverine spin off, Rendition is a decent thriller with a top notch cast, in a narrative that has been proved quite popular these days - the split, which provides for some ample differential perspectives to be presented through an ensemble cast.<br /><br />Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally), a chemical engineer, gets renditioned en route to going home under the orders of CIA top brass Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep). At a detention facility outside the US, Jake Gyllenhaal's CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (oh so prophetic) embarks on his very first interrogation session, no doubt being thrust into a position that he didn't sign up for. Back home, a very pregnant Reese Whitherspoon searches frantically for answers to her husband's disappearance, and sought after an ex-flame Alan Smith's (Peter Sarsgaard) assistance, since he's working for Senator Hawkins (Alan Arkin). Throw in J.K. Sinmmons, a terrorist plot investigation and a budding forbidden love story between Fatima (Zineb Oukach) and Khalid (Moa Khouas), you have quite a bit going on in a busy picture.<br /><br />Given a number of casts, locations, timelines and the likes, Rendition wasn't confusing at all, and it plays out with deft handling of the material, never quick to judge, presenting ideas and thoughts from both sides of the equation. Every character has their own agenda, and the unveiling of this agenda engages enough not to bore nor to confuse you. And the best part of it all is how, very truly, they bow down to self-preservation in different forms, and ultimately, in various lose-lose situations unfortunately. It kept you guessing as well - did he or didn't he, and constantly played with your mind as to whether Anwar deserved what he's getting. It utilized one extremely smart sleight of hand which I didn't see coming until it's too late (so there goes the credit), though it did succumb to the usual stereotyping of terrorist militants, and without spending much time in depth to explore their motivations. <br /><br />Perhaps it didn't find a need to, given so many movies out there already touching base on this issue (Paradise Now, Day Night Day Night, Syriana even). While it turned out to be rather one-dimensional (personal tragedy to strapping of bombs to become a suicide bomber), I felt Rendition did right in not providing any saccharine sweet ending, that this fight against negative, destructive ideology, isn't something that can be addressed in a two hour movie, and I'm glad it steered clear such fairy tale implausibilities. <br /><br />What we have instead is a well crafted tale that sets its gun sights on the issue of Rendition, and probably capable enough to spark discussion once the lights come on, on which camp you belong to - do you support inflicting severe pain in interrogation? Yes or No? This is the quintessential question of our time. Yes or No? (OK, I'm already geared for Lions for Lambs)!\",\n"," 'Okay, by now we all know that the whole \"Horrorfest 8 Films To Die For\" thing was a shameless ploy. They tried to get people to pay to see movies that, in their words, were \"too terrifying\" for normal audiences. The sad truth is that they were all mediocre horror films that couldn\\'t find distribution and weren\\'t nearly good enough to release on a wide scale. Apparently, some people did go to see them, money was made and the gimmick was fun for the horror fanatics. Long live William Castle.<br /><br />But that was then. Now that they\\'re on DVD, we can all rate and review them for what they are. I\\'ve just finished watching one of the eight, Dark Ride, and I have to say that I am astonished and amazed that this movie received ANY kind of release but not for the reason you might think. I didn\\'t mind the dumb plot, the wretched acting, the stupidity of the characters and the retarded ending. I expect all of those things when watching a movie like this. It\\'s part of the fun.<br /><br />My amazement came from watching this and realizing very quickly that the people who made it have absolutely no idea how to shoot a movie. From a technical standpoint, it\\'s an abomination. If you don\\'t believe me, watch it and try to keep track of how many times shots go out of focus because the cameraman (or the director, who can say) has no idea what he\\'s doing. Watch the scene at the gas station and count how many times the camera or the shadow of the camera creeps into the shot. I lost count. At one point, as Jamie-Lynn\\'s character is wandering through the ride, she falls down...and the camera completely misses it. Here\\'s some advice for the director: if you\\'re going to make a movie, hire someone who can pull off the shots you want (by the way, Mr. Singer, you weren\\'t fooling anyone with that awful cut you tried to pull off for the shot of the van\\'s headlight). Most low-budget horror movies come off as amateurish but shoddy, careless film-making like this is inexcusable.<br /><br />Look, I know that there are things that directors do to save time when shooting a low-budget film. One of them is to set the camera up in one spot and capture all of the action from one angle, zooming in to each actor so you can capture all of the coverage without a bunch of different set-ups. The dorm room scene in the beginning is a prime example of this (notice that we only see one side of the room) and so is the gas station scene (once they had the camera on the dolly, they obviously didn\\'t have the time to do another set-up so everything in the parking lot is shot from the left). Why would this bother me, you ask? Because when a film gets ANY kind of theatrical release (even if it\\'s only a week) and the distributor (especially a distributor as big as Lion\\'s Gate) asks people to pay $9.00 to see it, I expect that film to adhere to a certain amount of professionalism. Calling this a professional film is like calling Adolf Hitler a sweetiepie. It just ain\\'t true.<br /><br />Just a couple of things on the DVD that I thought were hilarious. If you look on the back of the DVD box, you\\'ll notice that the word \"attraction\" is spelled wrong (talk about inexcusable and amateurish) and just try not to laugh when, in the special features, one of the writers (the one with the man boobs) admits that it took him four months(!) to write the script.<br /><br />Oh, and I\\'ve been around long enough to realize that most of the \"great\" reviews this movie has received on this site (A Classic! A Thrill Ride! Awesome! Old-School Horror At It(sic) Finest!!!) are all from people involved with the film or friends and family of the filmmakers. Guys, that is getting so old.

The best line and the part that really shows what the problem with Bulimia is, is when Beth says,\"It\\'s not about you!\" That line really showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem. It showed that people with Bulimia don\\'t have this problem because of anything that has to do with anyone else. It has to do with them and them only. It shows that it\\'s time to talk about the person with the problem instead of putting the attention all on themselves. It showed that Beth needed to call out for attention at that moment and she needed her mom\\'s attention at that time the most.',\n"," 'The television series Futurama is nothing short of brilliant and in my opinion is the best television series ever. I personally do not actually like science fiction movies or series aside from this one show which i give an exception too.<br /><br />Futurama is easily leaps and bounds above the rest as it focuses substantially on character development and does avoid the common stereotype of \"a family\" as the focus. Instead the focuses of Futurama is simply several unique and hilarious work colleagues and there many adventures across the universe. What also is very unique is the characters are all different and each have there own opinions which provide an excellent contrast in the series. Another aspect of Futurama which surpasses other animation shows is the quality of the visuals. Futurama is notorious for having excellent visuals and has won several Emmy\\'s for its animation achievement. The positives do not stop there; Futurama is amazing at portraying an amazing amount of emotion into the episodes that at some times had my holding back tears. This level of emotion is not even present in the Simpson\\'s.<br /><br />One final positive thing worth saying is that the show is able to appeal to all audiences, not just sci-fi lovers. For example by 50-year old mother can\\'t stand sci-fi and she absolutely loves the show. The series itself does however contain some sexual humor that is structured rather uniquely to simply pass over young children\\'s heads. Essentially all the sex jokes made will not be understood by the younger viewers.<br /><br />Of course the show is not perfect as at it does of course have flaws. But thankfully these flaws are out shined by the brilliance of the series.<br /><br />All I have to say is the biggest mistake in television history was to cancel this show, and put Family Guy back on instead of this. Conversely I am glad there are several more movies coming out which will provide the shows many fans with much more laughs. Overall I give the series a 10. One of the two television series I have ever given this too. The other being the Simpson\\'s.',\n"," \"Watching this again after a gap of many years and remembering the flop it was upon its original release, I am surprised at how well it has held up. One of the reasons for its failure was that one generation just thought it was over indulgent crap and a younger one was disappointed that it did not show the full hippy glory. Seen now it is clear that Antonioni was already aware of and fascinated by the heady mix of fervent enthusiasm for change and a lack of any clear vision for the future. The lead pair are excellent and it is shameful that they took so much flak for the film's perceived failure. They are ideal and convey perfectly the various contradictions and demonstrate a pure delight in lovemaking. I blame others for the over emphasis on the student revolt sequences at the start but have to say that from there on in this is one of the directors most beautiful looking pictures and he certainly got the very best out of the man made and natural landscapes.

Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor at her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic, before she gave in to the gaspy hysterics that marred her later work. All the supporting players round it out, and I do wonder who trained all those elephants.<br /><br />Speaking of the stone-Buddha sequence, you really can discern that it's Vivien Leigh in the long shots. Her shape and the way she moves is distinct from Taylor's. The only thing marring that sequence are the poorly done process shots, where the background moves by much too fast for horses at a walk.<br /><br />If you want a thought-provoking film that is beautiful to watch and never boring, spend a few hours with Elephant Walk.\",\n"," 'What has to change in today\\'s attitude towards films like Boogie Nights is the approach.

But when the teens arrive, it doesn't seem very dangerous at all, well according to me anyway. It's a shame that we don't get movies like this any longer, and if we do, it's usually some boring terrible film.<br /><br />This movie more relies on tension and being scary than gore, because the gore factor is really low in this movie which I wasn't pleased with but other than that it's still a great movie.<br /><br />All in all you'll have to search long and hard to find this movie and if you do find it, you will like it and also watch out for ending with the final girl and the killer it's totally not what you'd expect.\",\n"," 'This rather poorly named western series won an Emmy for best syndicated program and is certainly an interesting series. It was produced by Republic, the studio which did action better than anyone, and they put their best into it. Each episode was built around a real historical figure of the old west. A railroad detective named Matt Clark, similar to the later Elliot Ness with the gangsters of the 1920\\'s and 30\\'s, managed to become involved with almost every notorious western outlaw between the middle of the 1800\\'s and WWI. The series\\' best asset was Jim Davis. Tall, rugged, ruggedly good looking, in prime shape, with an authentic western accent, and great riding skills which made him utterly convincing in the action scenes, Davis was every inch the western hero. He was teamed with two lovely and active co-stars, Mary Castle as \"Frankie\" during the first season, and Kristine Miller as \"Jonesy\" during the second. Each worked well with Davis.<br /><br />What separated this show from its contemporaries and much of what came later was the professionalism invested in the action scenes. Ace action directer William Witney directed 30 episodes. Franklin Adreon the rest. Both filmed the action with polish. Republic\\'s vast store of stock footage from serials and B\\'s was utilized to give scope. The level of individual episodes rose or fell with the quality of the guest stars brought in to the play the outlaws. Among the really good ones were Marie Windsor as Belle Starr, Lee Van Cleef as Jesse James, Fess Parker as Grat Dalton, Jean Parker as Cattle Kate, and Joe Sawyer and Slim Pickins as Butch Cassady and \"The Smilin\\' Kid\". The cream of the western up and comers, Pickins, Parker, Denver Pyle, James Best, and Richard Jaeckel, honed their craft. B veterans with decades of experience under their belts, Harry Woods, Glenn Strange, Kenneth MacDonald, Earle Hodgkins, Steve Darrell, and Chief Yowlachie, provided the old leather feel of vintage westerns.<br /><br />The weakness of the concept was that there are only so many famous western outlaws. By the second season the famous figures were becoming a mite obscure for all by the most dedicated history buff. Nevertheless, a few of the later shows were a match for any, due to the guest stars. Henry Brandon portrayed rustler Nate Champion, and former Republic star Don Barry was outstanding as small-time outlaw Milt Sharp.<br /><br />Western fans or history buffs will want to see this.',\n"," 'I started watching this because i thought it was a really shitty porno. As i kept watching the only thrill i got from this movie was finding out what the name of it was so i could look it up and rip on it. I just finished it and have considered ending my life knowing that someone actually made this movie.<br /><br />For the people who commented on this movie as having a good script and great acting, my words of wisdom for you are that you probably have no friends because you were in the movie. You are probably wishing you had all that time back of your life that you wasted on making this movie.<br /><br />There is no way that this is a serious movie. There was an old guy that gets stabbed and it doesn\\'t even hurt him at all. And when everyone else gets stabbed they drop dead.<br /><br />It was probably important that these people killed random people and ate them and also hung out with an 80 year old man that wanted to put the parts into his body.<br /><br />My favorite part was when the old man found the \"hemoglobens\" or however you spell it because that made the movie seem very intellectual and probably helped to reach the older crowd.<br /><br />What really blew my mind that they decided to throw in that random scene about the college girls going into the woods looking for fake skulls.<br /><br />If you do attempt to see this movie, you should probably fill up your bathtub and drop your hairdryer in it and be ready to jump in.<br /><br />THIS IS A MUST SEE!!!....for anyone who believes there life could not get any worse because this will help you realize there are people out there(the makers of this movie) who are even more pathetic and are going no where in life.',\n"," 'The Scarlet Pumpernickel is a great and very interesting take on the Alexandre Dumas classic The Scarlet Pimpernel. The short starts with Daffy getting frustrated at only being typecast in comedy, and reads HIS version of the classic to the producer. The rest is a roller-coaster of priceless performances from the toons, swashbuckling and sight gags complete with references to Errol Flynn, with an unexpected ending to boot. The animation is pretty much spotless, and the music is rousing. The story is fun, and there are some many good moments, so much so I cannot think of my favourite part.<br /><br />The toons however are the real stars here; Daffy takes on the role of \"The Scarlet Pumpernickel\" and does so with gusto. Porky is given little to do but does what he can with The Lord High Chamberlain, while Sylvester relishes his part as the Duke. Also Melissa is a very beautiful and cute duck I think. All thanks to the marvellous vocal talents of the immortal Mel Blanc. All in all, hugely entertaining. 9/10 Bethany Cox',\n"," '...this is like watching some movie from Yugoslav era, it gave me eeries. Same plot as always when it comes to Yugoslav film school-everything begins with funny plot and everyone think it will end funny, too. But for people from ex-YU it is always predictable-IT HAS TO END WITH A TRAGEDY. That is how all movies from ex-Yugoslavia end. That is how ex-Yugoslavia ended its existence. Also this movie is not Croatian only, unfortunately, it is Croatian-Bosnian-Serbian-Macedonian-Albanian production. Actors did their job excellent, three main male characters were superb, female role is a little bit pale and unconvincing to any foreign viewers. Rajko Grlic did an excellent job with \"Stefica Cvek-U raljama zivota\", I think he should stick to urban sophisticated stories as Stefica was.',\n"," '\"Gracie\\'s Choice\" is an excellent made for TV movie about the uphill battle of one child to preserve her family, despite social workers, an ex-convict for a mother (well played by Anne Heche) and a system that offered her little help.<br /><br />At first, one may think this to be the usual run-of-the mill feel good movie; against foster parents, depicting the dysfunctional family in America. Not so; it is a hopeful story which Kristen Bell, (as Gracie) must care for her half- brothers and sisters (they are all illegitimate) before she even graduates high school.<br /><br />The story is initially sad, showing Heche as an irresponsible, possibly disturbed woman. She has many children, does not know who their fathers are, and manipulates her elderly mother (Diane Ladd) into supporting all of them- she basically collects welfare support for each child and squanders it.<br /><br />As Gracie matures, she sees her mother for what she truly is, and decides she must adopt the younger children. Her sister becomes pregnant at 16 to escape the situation, and goes off to live with a different boyfriend. Gracie emerges stronger, with the help of social services and her counselor she finds an apartment, a job, and attends school and graduates as well.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good film, because it accurately depicts a true story, the reasons kids have children prematurely, and the ultimate responsibility it is of the parent (in this case, negligent Anne Heche), for the kids turning to out the way they do.',\n"," 'I loved this movie 10 years ago when I was about 16 years old.

This movie is painful. Unfortunately, the best performance comes from the former Reality TV star. The acting is awful. I kept getting the feeling that this movie was made by a few guys who wanted to get some chicks naked, play with guns, and screw around with fake blood. This movie is what gives the horror genre such a bad stigma. It strives to be camp, but only succeeds at being terrible. To make matters worse it's completely unoriginal. The guys that made this seemed like they just wanted to recreate some of their favorite slasher horror scenes, then just threw a couple of rape scenes in for that extra shock factor. I'm two into 2007 Horrorfest, and I have yet to be impressed. Maybe they changed judges because this movie is nothing compared to any of 2006 8 films.

If this is loosely based on Carlos Hathcock's sniping, I am guessing that it is a 7mm. round. I am also curious of the rifle itself. He also made a comment in the final Sniper movie about the rifle that the Vietnamese man let him use that belonged to his father. Beckett mentioned that he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever made. I would like to know which rifle that is also. I know that this particular rifle was made around WWII or beforehand. I just couldn't get a close enough look at it watching the movie to identify it.<br /><br />As for Mr. Hathcocks kills, his longest shot was 1.47 miles, and he had 93 confirmed kills and 14 unconfirmed kills. After his wounds somewhat healed from being burned in Vietnam, he spent the rest of his career teaching snipers in the USMC the skills that they would need in the field. His sniping career is still mentioned to our brothers and sisters that train in the USMC. I found out his name from my friend who is a former Marine.

Thats not to say this film is completely void of any gritty (and sometimes gory) realism on the 'war' front but it just doesn't focus so much on the agony, more so on the individual and the reasons behind such atrocities.

They were films loaded with atmosphere but short on actual horror. Uzumaki, to me, seems clearly influenced by these films. It has a number of fairly mundane scenes that become more portentous the deeper you are sucked in by the film. It also has more scenes of outright horror and although I don't think the film actually measures up to those two films it is well worth the time of most thoughtful fans of the unusual (not necessarily horror). 7 out of 10 seems fair but I must say that years after seeing The Last Wave the film still stays with me, and it is precisely Picnic At Hanging Rock's unresolved ending that makes it so haunting. p.s.

It isn't as if the DVD is overflowing. Did the DVD editor go on holiday or just drop a can of film? Weird. The result is just wrong. Didn't anyone on the original production review the work before issuing it?<br /><br />Some sequences are laugh out loud funny. The eye candy, the tattoo, was happening, and a few other cameos.

From then on the story follows the journey of the Abberton brothers - Sunny, Koby and Jai - as they face court cases, gang violence and some massive waves.<br /><br />While I can appreciate the rags-to-riches story of the Abberton brothers, for me the story never really seemed to hit home. This may be because of the negative stigma that often goes hand-in-hand with the Bra Boys. However, I believe it is much more simple than that: it is a poorly directed and edited film. Too often was I distracted by the uneven sound, sub-par camera work and jumpy interview sequences.<br /><br />Yet, the film really shines when it is left to people other than the Abberton brothers to describe the various incidents through their own retelling. This balances the film nicely, rather than have Koby or Jai recount their own court cases and possibly omit certain details. Another element that enhances this film is the surf footage, which really is the tie that binds all these 'Bra Boys' together.<br /><br />But I found that the negatives far outweighed the positives for this film. It provides an interesting insight into one of Australia's most notoriously tight-knit surf cultures, yet the Abberton influence raises questions of bias regarding the various events which envelop his brothers.

The one thing I dreaded most prior to seeing this was the fact that it stared a WWE wrestler, Kane. He ended up doing a decent job considering he only had 2 one-word lines in the movie. There are a couple fairly gory moments, mainly involving eye-gouging and a quite memorable scene in which a girl gets a cellphone shoved down her throat-- probably the most effective demise in the movie.<br /><br />I can't say that this movie really shows us anything new and is definitely far from great.

DeMille directed until a 2000 made for television film that starred Bill Pullman as the cowboy who's only known by the state he originally hails from, this is the story that set the standard for the western novel that has come down to this day. Owen Wister (1860-1938) was a classmate and close friend of Theodore Roosevelt and when the book came out in 1902 it was dedicated to the new president who was in his second term of office.<br /><br />Both Wister and Roosevelt were easterners who had gone west at critical portions of their lives and made careful note of the mores and customs of the people living there. Roosevelt went to the Dakota territory and Wister was in the new state of Wyoming just in time to view the famous Johnson County range war. It certainly was a period where certain folks did make up their own version of the law out in Wyoming and in this Wyoming setting of The Virginian as law and order was usually days if not weeks away, lynching lawbreakers was an accepted if not honored practice.<br /><br />And that's what happens in The Virginian as Gary Cooper catches old friend Steve played by Richard Arlen rustling cattle of the Box H ranch where he is foreman. It's unfortunate that he did not catch gang leader Trampas played by Walter Huston, but the incident sets the scene for the inevitable western showdown.<br /><br />There was western literature before The Virginian, popularized by writers like Ned Buntline. They were called 'penny dreadfuls' as a commentary of their cost and worth. Usually they took real western characters and made up these fantastic unreal stories about them. Real western historians in fact are still trying to separate truth from myth about all these people because of these stories.<br /><br />Wister was a careful chronicler of what he saw and what he saw set the standard for later writers like Zane Grey, Louis L'Amour, Luke Short, etc. All the western clichés we've grown to expect in films got their start right here.<br /><br />The Virginian set the standard in literature and film for a whole genre of entertainment.

What do you do? Well, if you're a Hollywood studio, you change the Japanese G.I.s in G.I. Samurai (aka Timeslip) to the crew of an American aircraft carrier, have them debate stopping the attack on Pearl Harbour for 90 minutes and then go home and hope that no-one reminds you that Japan did it first and with more balls in 1979 with this Sonny Chiba movie. But unlike its Hollywood counterpart The Final Countdown, this sees its premise through: thrown back 400 years into the Japanese feudal wars, its peacetime soldiers decide that their best hope of getting back lies in provoking history by trying to change it by joining with a warlord to conquer the country \\x96 cue lots of tank and helicopter vs. samurai action, including a very impressive unrelenting 25 minute battle sequence featuring a cast of thousands inflicting serious damage on each other. And yes, there are decapitations.<br /><br />Of course, things don't go as planned, and even superior firepower doesn't stand up as well as hoped to thousands of soldiers. Even before that, the soldiers are falling out with each other into those who want to go home, those who want to go to war and those who want to rape and pillage for the Hell of it. Impressively directed and surprisingly well thought through, the soft rock and country and western songs are sometimes a distraction, especially when they feature English lyrics sung by Japanese singers who audibly can't pronounce the words let alone speak the language, but it's a forgivable flaw in a surprisingly good sci-fi actioner.<br /><br />Optimum's UK DVD is a good transfer of the uncut 138-minute version.\",\n"," '\\'The Dead Next Door\\' is an ode to all things Zombie. A homage to Sam Raimi, Tom Savini and the great zombie-king George Romero; done on a next to nothing budget. Shot entirely on Super-8, and written, produced, edited and scored by J.R. Bookwalter; this thing looks and feels just like one would expect it to: Indie. I found the storyline to be about as entertaining as it could be. Zombies running amuck. Scientists trying to cure them by running tests (much like Romero\\'s \\'DAY of the Dead\\'), which end up being fruitless. Nice little original twist here too, a \"Zombie Squad\" who hunts down and kills them as in most zombie films, but this time they are roadblocked by a group of what appear to be leftist democrats trying to preserve the human rights of zombies. Haha. Not too far fetched in this day and age. Anyhow, this leads the Zombie Squad to a farmhouse outside of Akron Ohio, where an original group of doctors almost perfected a serum which could get rid of the problem once and for all, problem is now that farmhouse is inhabited by a cult of zombie worshipers, led by a Rev. Jones, no doubt a tongue-in-cheek dark homage to the madman Jim Jones of Jonestown fame.<br /><br />So it is what it is. A low-budget, ultra cheesy, terribly acted zombie gore-fest. By my standards of gore - my standards being Jackson\\'s \\'Braindead\\' as the godfather of gore for a zombie flick; \\'The Dead Next Door\\' is slightly below average, but still having enough squirting blood and decapitations to keep me happy. Enjoy this film with some mates and a few pints.<br /><br />4 out of 10.',\n"," 'This happened to be just starting on TV when I opened it, and as I felt too lazy to change the channel, I ended up watching it. Man, was that fortunate.<br /><br />This film is more of a fairy tale than a demanding drama, and at times openly sentimental one. It is definitely what one could call a feel-good movie, and I usually find such either boring or irritating. Yet this film is so very well done I could not help but love it. The script will not twist your brain; it is conventional, but flawless. The actors are brilliant, every single one is a perfect fit for the role. There is not much of a score, but the bits of music enhance the movie beautifully.<br /><br />If you can appreciate other things than expensive pyrotechnics, vicious murders or saving the world in a movie, do watch this if you ever have the chance. 5/5',\n"," \"Corny and some really bad acting but for a Golan-Globus film about right on par. Saw this movie back in 1985 mostly because I liked sword and sorcery films(what was i thinking?). Arnold is in it playing a high lord trying to make sure an ancient talisman is destroyed before it blows up the world.Brigitte Nielsen is the title character who at the time was Sly's girl and a pretty bad actress.Movie producers like to cast Playboy type women who cant act in low budget B movies. Brigitte cheeses it up as Sonya and Arnold acts wooden as Lord Kalidor.There is also Sandahl Bergman(who was in the original Conan movie as Valeria)here she plays the evil Queen Gedren,an obvious camp to her Conan role. And then one of the most irritating child actors onscreen(ernie reyes)as Prince Tarn who should have been slapped hard and sent to bed.What a little irritating scut. Some of the swordfights arent too bad but the music really sucks. Special effects are cheap and look very 70's ,like the explosion of the evil queen's castle at the climax of the movie. <br /><br />Overall a very low par film but b movie film buffs might like it for its campiness.\",\n"," \"well done giving the perspective of the other side fraulein doktor captures both the cost and the futility of war. excellent acting especially when german high command refuses in the name of chivalry to present medal kaiser ordered struck. the scenes of carnage are probably too intense for effete US minds who'd probably prefer some silly speeches and senseless abstractions like 14 points or the league of nations. real americans might appreciate the story line and the action. for all the action and intrigue, fraulein doktor compares favo(u)rably to Jacob's Ladder.\",\n"," '\"Pushing Daisies\" for sure is one of the best TV shows of its genre in the last 5 years, agree you with that or not. Bryan Fuller, the creator, has an amazing creative mind. He\\'s the mind behind other great TV Shows as \"Dead Like Me\" (2003), \"Wonderfalls\" (2004), and the other one not as great as these ones, but also interesting, \"Heroes\" (2006). It\\'s a mix of the marvelous worlds Brian Fuller created in previous TV shows, mixing once again an amazing fantasy world with real kinds of people disguised into colorful images and exaggerated feelings, something that a fairytale always is. So, being a kind of fairytale, you cannot expect more than a unrealistic world and unexpected situations, or also situations a lot expected but not in a way that it would usually be told.<br /><br />A gift always comes with a curse, and what is sweet can also be bitter. That\\'s so, Ned (Lee Pace), The Piemaker, is a simple guy with an interesting gift other than being an amazing chef: he can give life to the dead with just a touch. This could be a power that everybody would die - or live - for if wasn\\'t for another simple and very sad thing: he can also gives the forever dead if he touches it again. The curse of this amazing gift doesn\\'t stops there... everything has a compensation and if he brings anything to life for more than one minute, another specie of that one would die instantly. He\\'s a guy full of unfortunate events in life in a way that he grown up introspectively, always afraid to touch everything and lose once more things he one day used to love. Till the day he could finally be close to his biggest childhood love, Chuck (Anna Friel), if wasn\\'t for another sad fact: she was dead. He gave her life again and she loves him so much as he does, but this love is untouchable. The truly kiss of death. And that\\'s how this beautiful modern fairytale starts.<br /><br />When I heard about \"Pushing Daisies\" for the first time it was promoted as something very familiar (or maybe some kind of tribute) to everything that Tim Burton has created since \"Pee-Wee\\'s Big Adventure\" (1985) to \"Big Fish\" (2003) and \"Charlie And The Cholate Factory\" (2005). The results could not be better. The world around The Pie Hole was magnificent. The stories around Ned and Detective Cod (Chi McBride) to solve unsolved crimes can be a lot common in TV, but this is just a way to guide people thru amazing stories surrounding characters as Chuck and Olive (Kristin Chenoweth) in a wonderful world full of beautiful and dreamy images that you can almost sense the taste of the colors. Not only that, you are merged into a bunch of amazing and charismatic gentle characters, even those ones with the most deep dark humors.<br /><br />Forgetting the trivial concept of murders and unsolved crimes, the show brights and is triumphant in a lot of other things. The actors here are top of note. Lee Pace is tender, soft and contained as the character asks for. Anna Friel is the muse of the show as her character is supposed to be. But the most superb times are always with the supporting actors as Chi McBride (Detective Emmerson Cod), Swoozie Kurtz (as Lilly Charles), Ellen Greene (as Vivian Charles) and Kristin Chenoweth (as Olive Snook). Swoozie Kurtz shines performing a so dried character drowned in a impossible dark humor that could frighten a clown, for sure she has the best dialogs and her expressions and body languages are mesmerizing. But if the best dialogs are given by Swoozie and her character, the best funny moments are given by Kristin Chenoweth. Seems that she\\'s improvising all the time, she\\'s so naturally fun that every single scene is a show aside. Kristin shines so bright in the show that winning the 2009 Emmy for her supporting role in the show was totally fair and deserved. Also there\\'s the chemistry between actors and their characters, that are also amazing.<br /><br />There are no words to express what this TV Show really is and what it was meant to be. For those ones who think this show is a waste of time or claimed to find no sense in it, for sure needs to open their minds and comeback to a time that they probably never had: childhood.<br /><br />Truth be told... TV has never been so daring in a TV Show as with this amazing one. \"Pushing Daisies\" was a huge step forward in terms of great artistic entertainment and its sudden death was a lot disrespectful. It\\'s true that TV doesn\\'t respect great TV shows as those ones Bryan Fuller created - except \"Heroes\" that\\'s still on air and is far from being so amazing as the other ones.',\n"," \"Like many, I had high expectations for this film. And like many other reviews I've read here on the IMDb, I agree that the cinematography was well done, it was ridiculous to the point of comedy and there were a few moments in the film that almost saved it but bottom line up front, it was a huge disappointment. This movie was probably about everything except the Black Dahlia murder or Elizabeth Short. If that's what holds your interest about this movie, read about it in the Crime Library instead, this movie should have been called Boring Love Triangle Story With Quirky And Shocker Parts That Almost Save It But Don't Oh Yeah And Lots Of Eye Candy. The End.\",\n"," 'I have read all the bad reviews about this movie, and I have to agree with most of what has been said. It is true that the film is just plain ugly to look at, and the over-acting is sometimes embarrassing. But perhaps the critics are being a bit unfair by measuring it next to films like \"American History X\" and \"Romper Stomper\". If you put it next to a highly-produced Hollywood film like A.H.X, then sure this one will look sick in comparison. Or if you put it next to a truly fantastic piece of cinema like \"Romper Stomper\", a film that actually played in art house cinemas around the world, it just isn\\'t fair. The only thing these films have in common is their subject matter: skinheads. Period. Pariah lacks the artistic merits of these \"legitimate\" films. But when looked at in the \"trash film\" context, then this one becomes at least entertaining. Perhaps watch this one in the same way that you would watch \"Toxic Avenger\", or \"Shaft\", or \"Class of 1984\" etc.. Of course the way they portray skinheads in this movie is nauseating, offensive, and highly inaccurate. But lets face it; there are so few films made about the punk and skinhead scene, that when something comes along, we just have to see it. Anyway, look at the way punks are portrayed in \"Class of 1984\". Murderous criminals! But like Pariah, that flick is good for a laugh. In short, look at this one while you\\'re hanging out and drinking with friends. You have to admit, this trash film does deliver the goods when it comes to violence. It is stomach-turning in some places. And if you want to see a good, thought-provoking film about skinheads, see \"Luna Park\", the one about the Russian skinheads. But don\\'t expect a lot of action there. By the way, remember \"Skinheads: Second Coming of Hate\" with Chuck Conners?? Now there is a classic. \"Pariah\" is almost good compared to that one! A.C.A.B.',\n"," \"Sorry, I didn't go for this one.<br /><br />For starters, it was wa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-y too slow. The pace was so glacial it was hard to care what was happening.<br /><br />The rats were your basic gang of thugs. They were basically modeled after every 1930's gangster flick you could name. The party at the end looked like it was lifted from a Hollywood ball.<br /><br />The plot was either hackneyed or non-existent. Attempts at cuteness and emotions were so forced it was pathetic. And allowing the mouse and child 'toy' to suddenly function whenever a dramatic moment (hah) occurred just killed it.<br /><br />A kids movie NOT from Disney. The producers had a chance to make an impact. But they blew it.<br /><br />For insomniacs only.\",\n"," 'Spoilers...<br /><br />\"Dry cleaning\", that\\'s what the title of this Anne Fontaine\\'s effort means in English and it\\'s a well-appropriated one to qualify the contents of the story she tells the audience. Its bulk essentially occurs in a dry-cleaner whose purpose is to clean the customers\\' clothes but the director prefers to soil her couple\\'s clear conscience as well as their moral, sexual conventions.<br /><br />Could this film be a crossing between Claude Chabrol\\'s universe and Pier Paolo Pasolini\\'s film \"Theorema\" (1968)? It\\'s highly possible and they\\'re respectable credentials for this novel, idiosyncratic film. The first one for the provincial backdrop and a dash of gastronomy. The author of \"le Boucher\" (1970) and \"les Noces Rouges\" (1973) excelled when it came to depict vignettes of provincial life, in the Kunstler\\'s shop and apartment but also in the town itself. Anne Fontaine just has to describe with just a few features, the gloomy aura which reigns in Belfort. And the second reference for of course the story of the film which bears a strong resemblance with Pasolini\\'s opus: both introduced a young man who subverted a comfortable universe and caused damage in them. \"Nettoyage à Sec\" could be an updated version of \"Theorema\".<br /><br />Loïc is the disruptive element in the Kunstler\\'s \"petit bourgeois\" world. More than this, he\\'s the catalyst of their buried desires and passions. Before making their dreary universe with its constricting etiquette falter in the dry-cleaner\\'s, he will at first indirectly galvanize them to accomplish their desires. The week-end in Bâle, unusual in the couple\\' life is a proof of it. Before this, one of the key sequences is the one when the four protagonists are together in the hotel room because in this moment, the persona of Jean Marie and especially Nicole is well construed and defined. It\\'s necessary to steer well the evolution and crucial steps of the story. Nicole makes love with Loïc and it\\'s a sign that she\\'s tired of her life and is ready to go in a new direction. Later, Fontaine will intersperse her film with conspicuous signs which don\\'t fool anyone. See the scene in the restaurant: she confesses to her husband that she doesn\\'t feel courageous enough to carry on her nine-to-five life in the dry-cleaner\\'s. She\\'s on the verge of packing in. Jean-Marie\\'s answer is meaningful: \"however when we started, you wanted to be the first one to help me to settle here...\". So, it seems perfectly logical that later she accepts Loïc\\'s advances. As for Jean-Marie, he appears hesitant and undetermined but maybe would he like (unconsciously or not) change his life in spite of an eloquent sequence: when he takes Loïc downstairs to show him concrete memories of his first years spent in the shop. Memories to which he is deeply attached...<br /><br />Loïc\\'s demeanor is rather elusive and it\\'s hard to decipher his mainspring. Is it because he lost his closest human being in the world (Marilyn) that he settles to Nicole and Jean-Marie? Is he sick of his nomad life despite what he says to the couple? By enticing the couple, does he try to fulfill an affective gap in his life? It was shrewd from Fontaine to make opaque his motivations. Thus, he keeps all his mystery. It was also clever from the director to have chosen evocative colors for her film and she\\'s got a sense of light. The white of the dry-cleaner\\'s sharply contrasts with the half-murky, dimly light rooms in the apartment, especially when Loïc is in these rooms. This to underscore that the life of the couple with Loïc\\'s intrusion goes bit by bit unravel. She also has the gift to build her film on a relentless crescendo and to shroud it with an increasingly latent, ominous tension. A tension caused by several factors: disquieting moments or lines pronounced by Loïc, by the contrast between the appearance the couple gives to the customers and employees and what lies beneath this when they are in the apartment with Loïc, especially when the latter finds himself with Nicole. And it won\\'t take long for Jean Marie to discover their love affair. But also with Jean-Marie\\'s tantrums he has to try to resist to the strange attraction he feels for Loïc. His short wild mood swings are the result of a sexual repression he vainly wants to conceal. Loïc will feel it very well in the inevitable sequence in which he will try to sodomize him (a violent one which packs a real wallop). After this scene, one could argue that the couple came back to where they started but in worse: Nicole and Jean-Marie are destroyed.<br /><br />The acting is uniformly good and largely lives up to the demands of the scenario. The type of character of each actor of the quartet complements one another. Although the film really put Mathilde Seigner on the map, it\\'s her coy, brazen partner Stanislas Mehrer who gets the lion\\'s share. I don\\'t put Charles Berling and Miou-Miou in my straitjacket of favorite French actors but here, I was very taken with their acting.<br /><br />\"Nettoyage à Sec\" has a taut, well-constructed scenario in which every step of the story rings true. It\\'s an unsettling piece of work which leaves indelible stains. It may also walk a fine line with works like \"Harry: Un Ami Qui Vous Veut Du Bien\" (2000) by Dominik Moll which could be his little brother. I would like to discover Anne Fontaine\\'s anterior and subsequent works to her 1997 film.',\n"," 'I thought that the movie was dramatic with heart touching scenes.<br /><br />I would like to see a sequel to this movie.<br /><br />The ending does leave one to wonder what will happen to the Invisible People.<br /><br />Also a story line could be built on the idea that Tomme is now the Chief.<br /><br />A future sequel could show us how the tribe has thrived under the leadership of Tomme.<br /><br />This sequel could also show us Tomme and Kachiri and their family.<br /><br />I would like to see Tomme teaching his children about the traditions that were passed down to him from his adopted father Wanadi.',\n"," \"I'm sorry, but I don't know what people saw in this movie?

All ultimately works out well, naturally, but not before everyone involved has thoroughly chewed the scenery. Errol Flynn\\'s dead-on impression of Humphrey Bogart from \"Casablanca\" is a highlight, as are various send-ups of his own swashbuckling image (the \"jumping\" scene in the kitchen with Forrest Tucker is a riot). It is Tucker, though, who \"tucks\" the movie under his arm, lowers his head and barrels over the goal line. He demonstrates the comic flair more fully developed twenty years later in \"F-Troop\" and imparts a liveliness and energy that Flynn repeatedly plays off to raise his own performance. Eleanor Parker does a fine job as the woman being pursued, and little Patti Brady charms as Tucker\\'s actual pen-pal friend. A fine, lightweight \"coming home\" comedy in a genteel setting that children and romantics of all ages should find entertaining.',\n"," 'Not sure why this movie seems to have gotten such rave reviews.<br /><br />While watching \"Bang\" one night on TV, I found myself bored by the nonsensical, random plot which was occurring on screen. The entire movie seems to be nothing more than an exercise in meaningless, artsy-fartsy self-indulgence on the part of the filmmaker. The fact that the director/writer goes by a one name moniker only reinforces this sense of pretentiousness. <br /><br />Those interested in indie flicks would be better off looking for something better written and dare I say, more entertaining than this complete waste of time.',\n"," 'When I first saw this film in the 1980\\'s, I was in my middle teenage years and somewhat reluctant to see this since I considered myself grown up and out of the \"Sesame Street/Muppets\" age. I honestly don\\'t remember if I liked it at the time or not. However, somewhere in college I watched this film again, and it wound up going (and staying) into my personal Best Films Ever collection.<br /><br />This film is LOADED with humor that goes far above and beyond what one would have expected from the Muppets. I mean, obviously the Muppets always have appealed to adults and children because there\\'s humor geared towards both generations. But come on...Janice is accidentally overheard telling someone \"I don\\'t take my clothes off for anyone, even if it IS artistic\"...there\\'s a joke from a father to a son that if the son in love with Kermit the Frog then the father doesn\\'t want to hear it...Gonzo saves a chicken with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (sp?) and afterwards says \"I think we\\'re engaged now\"...these and plenty of other moments in the film had me rolling. Add to that very smart dialogue, very smart New York/Broadway \"wink wink\" humor, the usual large amount of celebrity cameos and some really enjoyable songs that don\\'t border on \"kid-level cheesy\" whatsoever...this film is a masterpiece! I don\\'t throw \"10\"\\'s out on a regular basis...but this one deserves it. Over 20 years later, this film totally holds up, perhaps even more so.

I am as forgiving as an audience can be, but once I had finally had enough of this one, I had a headache from the anger it caused me.

Normal people who, after facing the unimaginable from the occupation forces, decided that the best thing they could do was joining the armed conflict against the occupation. I know many people would argue about how Palestinians are terrorists and some such crap, but the point is: Who started it all? Before you judge someone for carrying out a bombing, you have to first put yourself in his shoes, and picture yourself carrying a 10 year-old bleeding, lifeless girl.<br /><br />One of the things that stuck in my head is something Arna said at the beginning: There's no peace without freedom.

The attention to detail is perfect - the '09' and '61' numberplates on the cars, the news ticker on the bottom of the TV - nothing at all gets missed. Billie Piper is outstanding as she shows just how good a sidekick Rose is, both Chloe and her mother play their parts perfectly, and David Tennant is brilliant as usual.<br /><br />The idea behind the whole story is genius, and the way it pans out even had me, a hardened Resident Evil fan, feeling tense a couple of times.

However, I can't imagine that the heavy amount of narcissistic navel-gazing, trite humor, or banal subject matter would be particularly engaging to anyone over 30. Another problem is that the peripheral characters, whom the filmmakers obviously have nothing but contempt for, are hyped up to such absurd caricatures for comic effect, that they fail to be relatable in any real way. <br /><br />However, one has to give some style points to the filmmakers, who obviously grew up in the video generation, and use every conceivable editing trick in the book in order to spruce up an otherwise non-existent plot. There are 2 points to remember here. First, beware of festival darlings. Second, even though we live in the age of youtube, not everyone's account of their mundane lives deserves big- screen treatment. But these young filmmakers have every right to make their film, and if others 20-somethings can find something in it to identify with, then all the better. Yet I could not help but think at the end of this film how this latest generation, just now coming of age, will fare in the real world that presents so many challenges and complications. In the age when every child is constantly reassured of how special they are, and that they all deserve their 15 minutes of exposure, resiliency and the ability to deal with adversity does not exactly appear to be this generation's strong point.\",\n"," 'I found this movie to be charming.

He sees the ad and he goes out to see her. She hires him. I really had some chuckles as their relationship progresses because I found it easy to put myself in their shoes.

One is that the film is just too slow in it\\'s exhibition. What we get is a good thirty minutes spent on showing how the Son of the Earth is constantly shaking naked on the ground while at the same time being molested and tortured by mankind. Such tasteless prolonging gets boring pretty fast and lacks the punch in delivering a blow to the viewer\\'s senses.<br /><br />Another point is \"Beggoten\\'s\" visual appearance and sound. The grainy, inverted, black and white low frame cinematography enchants the disturbing factor of the plot, but such novelties often work in only short periods of time. Then gradually begin to lose their effect as the audience becomes accustomed to the look. The audio suffers from the same problems. It\\'s constant repetitive and similar sounds become annoying so fast I had an urge to turn off the volume. \"Begotten\" loses it\\'s charm shortly after it begins. It tries to be original and creative but it fails to expand on the ideas hinted by the vague plot instead it repeats the same scene again and again.<br /><br />The conclusion is that \"Begotten\" is stuck in one moment. Even though plot-wise it tries to move forward, the visuals and audio remain the same throughout. Showing the same action in a slightly different way with just slightly a different sound. A gimmick cannot alone make a movie. It also needs pace and variety, something Merhige seems to have forgotten.',\n"," \"Man the ending of this film is so terribly unwatchable and dated that my entire film aesthetics class laughed like crazy. Now most of the rest of the film was okay. It had a few unintentionally funny scenes but had a few real good camera shots and editing. Yes Alderich is a great director who made FLight Of The Phoenix and Whatever Happened TO Baby Jane among others. The problem isn't with direction, acting or anything technical. The movie is just destroyed in the third act. Why? The murders, twists, turns and characters have all been revolving around NUCLEAR MATERIAL? What the heck was the writer smoking when he came up with that? The way it just comes out of nowhere may have been the biggest Deus Ex Machina in history. For all the complaints about Burton's Planet of the Apes, THe life of David Gale or Notorious I think THIS is the worst ending ever. What a let down.\",\n"," \"I've also collected many of 'The Destroyer' books, and at one time had close to 100 of them. When I came across this pilot, I sat down eagerly to see how they had handled the character. Two words: Very Disappointing. But what can you do in such a short time? The characters were wooden, the plot almost non-existent and the production values very low.<br /><br />Having a copy of the program might be something that the hardcore Destroyer fan might covet, most people would simply tape over the program once they watched it.<br /><br />If it had been produced a few years later, and came out on a cable channel, where the idea of a Perfect Assassin could be developed, then it might have had a chance.\",\n"," 'Man this is a lame scary movie, the dialogs and the sound is more like from a adult flick.

The cutting is also a incoherent thing, they jump all over the place with not so much connections. The killing scenes is not to recommend to anyone who have seen b horrors, even troma is better to scare me than this flick. What can you get out of this movie? I think nothing because of several reasons. The mention of magic in this movie is not really what\\'s it is about, at least that is what i read about the esoteric and magic. Many things in this movie is incoherent and badly cut, with weird camera positions and many things that you \"need\" to get a horror flick. Not the innovating kind.',\n"," 'Princess Warrior is a science fiction action movie with a pretty thin plot-essentially on the death of their queen mother two sisters, one evil and one good, fight for control of the throne. The good sister is being beaten so she escapes to Earth where she appears buck naked in a strip club in the middle of a wet t-shirt contest. The rest of the movie is basically one long chase scene, as the evil sister tries to find and kill the younger good sister. But the younger sister is helped by Bob, a good-hearted DJ, and everything is complicated by police involvement and the good sister\\'s ignorance of Earth customs and culture. The older sister catches up to her younger sibling several times but the latter manages to escape and go on the run again. Throughout all of this action, there is a cult of women on the home planet having some kind of a space age séance to bring the good sister back. Sadly a good portion of this film seems to be rather boring car chase scenes as they drive around Los Angeles (and what was that sound effect when the police car crashed???) The film culminates in another physical fight between the sisters with a predictable ending.<br /><br />It seems to borrow elements from Star Wars (the light sabers and the look of the girls\\' home planet in the opening and subsequent scenes), Dr. Who (the phone booth like means of transportation) and some of the costumes (from the cult on the home planet) could have been taken from Star Trek episodes.<br /><br />Ms. Dana Fredsti (the evil sister in the movie) in another user comment mentioned \"the endless (and dull) wet T-shirt contest. It is seriously the longest wet T-shirt contest in cinema history. And the only one where the contestants were wearing industrial strength cotton-polyester shirts that defied all efforts to get them wet and translucent.\" I couldn\\'t state it any better. The only thing I would add is that the music in this scene is just plain annoying.<br /><br />Most of the acting is pretty over the top, but that seems to suit the whole style of the movie. The actors playing Vinnie and Vito were just too much for me-I just found them annoying. Ms. Fredsti (Curette) seemed to be enjoying herself and not taking the whole thing too seriously, in contrast to Sharon Lee Jones who acted decently but seemed to be taking everything more seriously. All of the police were portrayed as bumbling idiots, presumably to add comic relief, which is a bit unnecessary, given that the whole movie was rather comical.<br /><br />From a ratings perspective, this film had a lot of foul language; some topless women and others scantily clad in thongs, but not enough skin to satisfy those who are looking for nudity; one sex scene that was portrayed in a non-graphic arty dreamlike fashion; and little violence-while there were threats of violence throughout, the scenes of both sword fighting and brawling were exaggerated, and too camp to be \"offensive\", though it looked like the actors were having a lot of fun with it.<br /><br />I have to wonder who came up with the character names? Ovule (a small egg), Curette (a surgical instrument used for scraping and cleaning), Exzema (suspiciously similar to a disease characterized by scaling skin and pruritus), Bulemia (an eating disorder with binging and purging) and Rickettsia (another disease)? <br /><br />Overall, this is a bad, low budget, campy, sci-fi action movie, but it did keep me entertained, though I might need a few drinks before watching it again.',\n"," \"Audiences will groan at the character of Mary Donnell. Bette Davis is normally looking out for number one--and she's definitely her good old self in the first half of the movie. The widow of a gangster, Donnell has become a super-competent legal secretary for a respected attorney in a big firm. She fends off unwanted press attention and generally handles herself quite well as a tough single girl in the big city.<br /><br />She becomes the mistress of her married boss at the law firm (although the Hays Office undoubtedly required the removal of any breath of sexual content here, it should be pretty obvious to all what is going on). In the second half of the movie, which focusses on Jack Merrick (Henry Fonda), whom Donnell has always loved, she achieves peaks of self-sacrifice that will send you staggering to the bathroom to throw up.<br /><br />This is the sort of film that gives soap opera a bad name.\",\n"," 'Here is a movie from the \"biggies\".. the YASH-RAJ, who seem to be thinking that a sales is everything even if the product is a total crap. The whole movie is so much pain to heart and brain. OK, bollywood movies are generally unconvicing, but even in the David-dhavan kind of un-realism, you expect a comedy plot, sufficient to make you feel, time worth spent. Here seemingly \"underpaid\" writers wrote 1/3rd of the dialogues and repeated each at least 3 times to make a regular 3-hr movie. Director Kunal Kohli somehow manages to make sure that none of the scenes, I mean not even a single one, is something one could think logical. Even hypothetically logical.<br /><br />After watching this movie, I have more respect for the directors and writers of recent movies I watched like \"Begin Cirus\", \"Taxi number 9211\".

Very simple, the movie is about a bunch of Munchies-like gremlins on the loose, exploiting people\\'s desires for fame, fortune, prowess, and of course, sex in ways that end up with people getting killed. But this is the kind of movie where the acting is so ridiculous (a test of machismo, for example, is illustrated by two guys who battle in the front yard with garden tools), the writing is so forced (such as the oft-described scene of a gremlin hanging on the arm of one girl who would notice it, if only she turned her head a quarter to the left... and this isn\\'t the first time in the movie this happens), and the story is so... rarely given attention (hence the MST3K riff about a \"law in the future where films have to be made by FILMmakers), that you actually root for the furry puppets to kill off everyone on screen. Worst movie... ever.',\n"," \"It's not very often a movie can literally make the entire audience laugh, and five minutes later fill their eyes with tears. Many movies try to do this, but few can deliver the emotional impact that this film did. Adam Sandler practically drags you in with his heated and often violent outbursts, but also makes you laugh when the shadow of his past isn't pulling him down. I'm not going to ruin anything, but there is one scene in particular that should have your eyes watering and lip quivering. Even the most macho of men would have to be heartless bastards to not feel something while watching this movie. Don Cheadle gives another great performance, but is out-shined by Sandler. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith give solid performances, but nothing in the line of the two leading roles. Sandler's humor is still present, which actually saved this film from being border-line depressing. There are several laughs to be had, but don't think you will stay there long, because it gets serious again without much warning.<br /><br />I could go on and on about how well this movie hit on just about every emotion the human body contains, but I will cut this one short. I feel there is no need to tell you anything more. Do yourself a favor and take the time to see this movie. Even if you have to wait until it comes out on DVD, it's 100% worth the time.

It felt a bit like a bad high-school drama class attempt at film making.

The bare wench leaves porno devices and a blow up doll, just like in \"TEWP.\" They get lost, the doofus gets lost, and the girls find their way back to their hotel. There they reenact the end of \"The Blair Witch Project,\" as cameras are dropped and the guide is seen playing hopscotch, a game integral to the thin plot.<br /><br />At least three of the sorority sisters here have unnaturally large breasts full of dimples and stretch marks, along with the rather obvious surgery scars. The one \"natural\" gal here is humiliated by the director. In a very unfunny, and overlong, end credit segment, outtake scenes where she could not get a line right is played over and over again ad nauseum.<br /><br />Julie Strain shows up in a fright wig to play the bare wench. This one scene seems to be added later, since no one could possibly be credited in the cast with shooting it. In the background, as the women cavort and stroke, you can see someone\\'s picket fence. This may be director Jim Wynorski\\'s backyard.<br /><br />This is just bad stuff. The lesbian love scenes are kelvin degrees cooler than \"The Erotic Witch Project\\'\\'s.

Here Lumet makes a thriller like it\\'s a work of art. Every detail is perfect. The acting is superb. The plot has no holes. The story rings true and clear and represents a tale about human frailty that would honor the greatest filmmakers and even the Bard himself.<br /><br />Hoffman of course is excellent. When you don\\'t have marquee, leading man presence, you have to get by on talent, workmanship and pure concentration. Ethan Hawke, who is no stranger to the sweet, little guy role, adds a layer of desperation and all too human incompetence to the part so that we don\\'t know whether to pity him or trash him. Albert Finney plays the father of the wayward sons with a kind of steely intensity that belies his age. And Marisa Tomei, who has magical qualities of sexiness to go along with her unique creativity, manages to be both vulnerable and hard as nails as Andy\\'s two timing wife. (But who could blame her?) It\\'s almost a movie reviewer\\'s sacrilege to give a commercial thriller five or ten stars, but if you study this film, as all aspiring film makers would be well advised to do, you will notice the kind of excessive (according to most Hollywood producers) attention to detail that makes for real art--the sort of thing that only great artists can do, and indeed cannot help but do. (By the way, I think there were twenty producers on this film\\x97well, maybe a dozen; check the credits.)

It was unlikely that the father (Albert Finney) could have followed the cabs that Andy took around New York without somehow losing the tail. This is minor, and I wish all thrillers could have so small a blip. Also one wonders why Lumet decided not to tell us about the fate of Hank at the end. We can guess and guess. Perhaps his fate fell onto the cutting room floor. Perhaps Lumet was not satisfied with what was filmed and time ran out, and he just said, \"Leave it like that. It really doesn\\'t matter.\" And I think it doesn\\'t. What happens to Hank is not going to be good. He isn\\'t the kind of guy who manages to run off to Mexico and is able to start a new life. He is the kind of guy who gets a \"light\" sentence of 10 to 20 and serves it and comes out a kind of shrunken human being who knows he wasn\\'t really a man when he should have been.<br /><br />See this for Sidney Lumet, one of Hollywood\\'s best, director of The Pawnbroker (1964), The Group (1966), Serpico (1973), Dog Day Afternoon (1975), Network (1976), and many more.',\n"," \"Oh my god. oh my god, i cant get over this movie.

I think what makes ncis rise above the rest of the crime shows, is the in-depth personalities that each main character has. Every episode is something completely different and offers a great hour of enjoyment. Humour though, i think is the key to ncis's success. For a crime show to be funny, but still uphold it's great plots is something the directors should be applauded for. Mark Harmon is an asset to the show offering a familiar (not to forget hot!) face, as does Michael Weatherly who plays the womanizing, yet cutie Tony DiNozzo, while his partner Caitin Todd played by Sasha Alexander offers good competition and a down to earth personality.

A Coy Decoy was one of these shorts, and I was truly shocked to read in another comment that it had been banned. When I was young I probably did not even understand the Black Beauty gag to begin with. Still this is probably why it was banned, though until I watched this on a video site, I did not even remember the gag. Upon viewing the video I did remember certain shots - in particular the shrinking of Daffy's hat and Daffy's eyes becoming clockworkish as the decoy circled him in The Lake. I was not bothered by the gag that was most likely the reason the gag was banned. Instead I was flooded with childhood memories of watching this short.

The editing looks like the squirrel got a hold of it, too. The DVD doesn't include many features, and the one I miss is subtitles, as the dialog is often hurried or slurred. It had the overall quality of a 70's porn film without the skin and sex, which is even more pathetic that a 70's porn film with the skin and sex. I found myself fast forwarding through parts of it and even then the film was slow. I finally turned the thing off.\",\n"," \"Rating: 7 out of 10. Directed by Barbet Schroeder. If you like Hitchcock's `Rope', then you will like this movie. `Murder by Numbers' stars Sandra Bullock as psychologically troubled yet brilliant police detective Cassie Mayweather. Her partner is Sam Kennedy, a non-discriminatory detective played by Ben Chaplin. <br /><br />The teenage killers are high school students Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt). These young psychotics are out to prove their superiority by committing the perfect murder and getting away with it, but the nearness of capture is exciting and thrilling to at least one of the killers.<br /><br />The supporting characters include a police chief, an assistant district attorney, and the high school janitor that the killers pin the murder on. The movie reminds me of various `Hitchcock' movies crossed with the TV show `Law and Order'. We see a fair bit of police work and it is really interesting to see which clues the detectives follow and which ones they don't.<br /><br />The other plot in the movie relates to Cassie Mayweather's past and incarcerated ex-husband. Most viewers found this aspect of the movie unnecessary and slow moving, but I found this to the most intriguing part of the story.<br /><br />`Murder by Numbers' is a nicely crafted movie if you are looking for safe, or should I say dangerous, murder mystery. For more thrills and suspense, try `Se7en' or Hitchcock's `Dial M for Murder'.\",\n"," 'Shannon Lee,the daughter of Bruce Lee,delivers high kicking martial arts action in spades in this exhilarating Hong Kong movie and proves that like her late brother Brandon she is a real chip off the old block. There is high tech stuntwork to die for in this fast paced flick and the makers of the Bond movies should give it a look if they want to spice up the action quotient of the next 007 adventure as there is much innovative stuff here with some fresh and original second unit work to bolster up the already high action content of \"AND NOW,YOU\\'RE DEAD\". When you watch a movie as fast paced and entertaining as this you begin to wonder how cinema itself was able to survive before the martial arts genre was created.I genuinely believe that movies in general and action movies in particular were just marking time until the first kung fu movies made their debut. Bruce Lee was the father of modern action cinema and his legitimate surviving offspring Shannon does not let the family name down here.Although there are several pleasing performances in this movie (Michel Wong for one)it is Shannon Lee whom you will remember for a genuinely spectacular performance as Mandy the hitgirl supreme.Hell;you may well come away whistling her fights!',\n"," \"The Honey, I Shrunk the Kids franchise was a huge deal and not to mention very famous. I loved Honey, I shrunk the Kids when I was little. It was an original story and had such an exciting plot! The sets were so amazing and the cast seemed like they enjoyed each other's company. Now Honey, I blew up the kid was pretty stupid, so I think they wanted to go back to the story that everyone loved.<br /><br />Basically, Adam is a little more grown up now and the mom's are going on vacation to leave their husbands with their children.

But when the wives come back after forgetting to give some meds to their son, they get caught in the machine as well, leaving the kids in the house alone!<br /><br />The plot is silly, but like I said, it was just a family film that I think some might get a kick out of. The original Honey, I Shrunk the Kids is the best, I think everyone could agree.

My initial reaction is one of wonder and happiness. I\\'m so happy films like this are being made in our age of blockbusters. <br /><br />Roy Andersson\\'s new movie \"You, The Living\" is nothing less than a complete masterpiece. You, The Living is composed by some 50 vignettes filmed with a static camera. I will not give away the content of the scenes here, because I hate when people spoil even the smallest details. But, yes, most of the scenes made the 1000 people in the Claude Debussy theatre absolutely baffled and amazed. When the film was over we applauded for several minutes, we had no other choice.<br /><br />So what\\'s the score with \"You, The Living\". Hm, Andersson isn\\'t afraid to take on the heavy questions; History, guilt, gand The Holocaust during WW2 are big subjects (and these themes work very well together).<br /><br />The images created are brilliant, the depth sometimes surpasses \"Songs from the Second Floor\". <br /><br />Well, sorry for this ranting, praising review. Look out for the Flying House in the beginning folks!<br /><br />10/10 stars - A Masterpiece (I never throw this grade out).',\n"," '\"Mightor\" is god-awful in every respect: animation, story, voice acting, sound, music, etc. Each episode is nearly identical: some bad thing kidnaps the chick, then Ken-doll caveman turns into Mightor, while his kid brother (son? whatever?) puts on a Mightor mask and pretends to be the hero. The kid attacks the bad guy and his Mightor mask covers his eyes. Whilst he can\\'t see, the real Mightor defeats the bad guy. The kid lifts his mask and thinks he did it himself. Rinse, repeat, show after show.<br /><br />HOWEVER. There is an entity that makes \"Mightor\" look good: \"Moby Dick.\" This show is too awful to even discuss. Its very existence will depress you like a rainy Sunday after the funeral of a close friend.

This movie was excellent at conveying the remove of the command from the ground troops and in pounding the utter futility of trying to control untamed nature and the Russian psyche.

For some reason, friends that are fans of both Burt Lancaster and/or westerns have not seen this movie. The action is taut.

He survives, begins to dole out his own justice and slowly each of his antagonists (and his main nemesis\\' girlfriend) begin to respect and admire this older man\\'s inner morality, courage and prowess. It\\'s a classic understated performance.<br /><br />There is one scene that I always remember. Valdez has successfully kept his pursuers at bay with his long range Sharps rifle. One of the men giving chase catches up with him and seeing the rifle (and having seen his compadres picked off with it) asks, \"Did you hunt buffalo?\" Valdez responds, \"No, Apache...before I knew better.\"',\n"," \"I am very disappointed that I watched all the seasons of Deadwood.

But I don't have to to know that any fan of the comic won't be too pleased with this film. Matt Salinger does his best with a lousy story. Captain America doesn't even finish one mission before he's frozen in ice, only to be thawed out 50 years later. The Red Skull is the villain, but in most of the movie he looks like a guy with acne problems. However, we do learn that the Red Skull had a hand in the JFK assassination. How Oliver Stone missed that lead is beyond me. The Captain's super powers seem to be limited to throwing his shield and faking car sickness. On the positive side, at times the film does have the feel of a 40's serial. I would've liked to see that carried out, but the film never decides whether to be serious or kind-of-corny. Instead it just ends up being boring.\",\n"," \"When I saw this film in the 1950s, I wanted to be a scientist too. There was something magical and useful in Science.

You\\'ve got to admit that\\'s a pretty clever type of shenanigans if you\\'re a ruthless and power-greedy businessman! The two get caught, however, but the girl escapes into the island jungle and finds rescue in the arms of a lone snake farmer (what an awesome profession that must be) and together they attempt to stop the illegal dumping. But it\\'s too late, unfortunately, as the years worth of industrial dumping spawned a hideous monster. You\\'ll have to be very patient and tolerant if you want to see a monster or alien or menace of any kind. We\\'re far beyond the 50 minutes mark until there\\'s a bit of gore and at that same moment the director thankfully reminds us that this movie is actually supposed to revolve on a monster of any kind with the discovery of a giant claw. Luckily from then and onwards, the pacing remains steadily fast, the atmosphere becomes grimmer, the make- up effects are satisfying and even Charles Napier\\'s supportive characters \\x96 which until then was a dull persona \\x96 becomes sleazier. Still, \"Alien from the Deep\" takes itself far too serious, what with all its environmentalist lessons, and even has a certain aura of pretension hanging around it.

It shows a hopeless world and a short flickering of a light at the end of the tunnel \\x96 without being pathetic. It takes the audience from a different angle and leaves no other opportunity than to let us be guided by our feelings, as no reason is visible \\x96 truth and background are missing.

Like another user commented - This is what i would have liked to see when i first watched \"Jurassic Park\" - Life and death of Dinosaurs in their natural habitat as a documentary. The CG are very lifelike, and the diversity of dinosaurs and habitats shown makes it also very educational.<br /><br />The series takes everything factually known about dinosaurs, adds a lot of good ideas on \"what it could have been\" to make up what then looks like a documentary series. What i missed was some small bar-graph constantly in one corner of the screen, moving between \"fiction\" and \"fact\" along with the narration and the pictures, because you often wonder how much is educated guessing, and how much is pure fantasy.<br /><br />To some clues on facts & fiction, you have to see the 50 minute \"Making Of\", which is not only very educational about the CG process and collecting and including the paleontologists knowledge into the series, but which also is very funny (Dinosaurs smoking cigarettes and complaining about CG animators).<br /><br />I highly recommend to watch this series before going into the upcoming Disney Dinosaur movie or watching any Jurassic Park (like) movie again. It will surely make you much more critical towards those movies. The Disney Trailers looked especially bad.',\n"," \"I went into The Straight Story expecting a sad/happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting. These I got. What I wasn't expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence. Leave it to Lynch to take a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition.<br /><br />If you didn't notice, watch it again, paying attention to the ages of the people Alvin meets, the terrain he's driving through, the reactions people give him, the kinds of discussions he has (one of the first is about pregnancy and children, one of the last is outside of a cemetery). The last road he drives down is particulary haunting in this context, as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount. The last mechanical failure could be seen as a death, and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife, in which he achieves the desired reunion.<br /><br />I only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention.\",\n"," \"I liked this movie much better than Schindlers List.

When she is asked to open the door for Elijah she goes back in time to learn about what really happened to the Jewish people. What was really sad was how her character died to save her friend that was sick and was said to be sent to the gas chamber. I think it is very sad what they had to go through.

As a Christian I especially look for morality in a movie, anywhere I can find it, as long as there is some I might just enjoy the movie.<br /><br />But where the heck is the morality in this movie ? probably in the fact that one woman just wants to have her man back and the other one wants to look \"Forever Young\". It felt rather light to me, just as Hollywood often does, put a bit of morals in it and mix it with a lot of useless action, basic character building, ambiguous events and there you have it. This one barely makes the exception, it has Bruce Willis, Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn as leads and that\\'s pretty much the reason I watched it to begin with.<br /><br />But then comes the \\'women\\'s fight for man\\' except here one woman is just looking for \\'immortality\\' (as many have put it) and that is basically the only part in which it differs from other movies. True this one was made in 1992 so it may deserve some of the credit but nonetheless it isn\\'t gripping at all.<br /><br />I stopped watching after hearing the Lord\\'s name being spoken three times in vain, how much do you have to go through before you say \\'enough is enough\\' ?<br /><br />I do not recommend this movie, even though Bruce Willis does good acting it does not save the movie, at all. I advise you to look for something else.<br /><br />God bless you all.',\n"," \"My son asked me, after I told him I had walked out of this movie, if I had checked the rating. Obviously, I had not.

Rarely does a film come along that causes me to out loud say during most of the viewing, \"this is a really good film....\" again and again. That is exactly what happened when I watched this film. I really do not understand how anyone could not like it. I found myself at moments crying and laughing at the very same moment, unable to control how I felt about the scene. The acting is outstanding. Eric Mabius- why is he not all over movie screens? He was really extraordinary. His seemingly effortless attempt on the screen impacted me in deep visceral ways. I thank him. In my opinion, Eric Schaeffer is one of the best filmakers around, and I hope he continues to rise to the challenges that he faces while trying to give us art in the face of ferocious commercial filmaking.<br /><br />',\n"," '[CONTAINS SPOILERS]<br /><br /> The Ninja Turtles are back with their friend, April O\\'Neil. She\\'s going on vacation and has brought the turtles some gifts. She brought Splinter a sceptor. One used in ancient Japan.<br /><br /> Meanwhile, in 1603 in Japan. The evil warlord Lord Norinaga has<br /><br />taken control of the village. He has a rebellious son, Kenshin. Kenshin goes inside the temple, takes a sceptor and says \"Open Wide, Gates of Time\". Now I\\'m not exactly sure why he does this. Sorry. And soon it\\'s the old switcheroo: April and Kenshin switch places.<br /><br />And clothes! Kenshin now wears April\\'s leather jacket and April wears Kenshin\\'s robes. The problem is soon identified. The sceptor has magic powers. It can transport beings through time. Leonardo announces they must go back and rescue April. Michaelangelo is cool with the idea, but wonders if they had pizza back then. Back in ancient Japan, everyone thinks April is a witch.<br /><br />Especially Walker, a sly devil who\\'s in cahoots with Lord Norinaga. They<br /><br />put April in a cage. Back in modern day New York, Michaelangelo has brought in some heavy artillery: Casey Jones! Casey has been given the task of staying behind and keeping an eye on Kenshin while the turtles go back in time. Soon they are ready to go. They\\'re transported into the places of four warriors riding horses in battle. They can\\'t seem to get the hang of them. Michaelangelo is riding his backwards, rides into the woods and get\\'s captured. He was also the one holding the sceptor so now it is gone. Michaelangelo also has an encounter with Mitsu, Kenshin\\'s love interest. The three other turtles go looking for Michaelangelo in the temple. They adapt to the language--most unsuccessfully, and rescue April (it\\'s what they live for). Also in jail with April was Whit, a man who looks remarkably like Casey Jones! They all escape together. The turtles also have an encounter with fury fighting warriors and whip them in their own creative style. Michaelangelo escapes from where we was being held captive. The turtles even save young Yoshi from a burning building. Michaelangelo does the risky job of going in and getting him, and Leonardo brings the kid back with mouth to mouth revelation. Raphael becomes good friends with Yoshi and teaches him to watch his temper, though he should be taking his own advice. The turtles know they must return to the future, or disrupt the time continueum and have a major paradox. Unfortunately, the sceptor is gone, so they build another one and quickly lose it. They find the original. They soon engage in a battle with the evil. They even send Walker right off a cliff. It was actually an accident on his part with a little help from Whit. Soon it\\'s time to go. Michaelangelo<br /><br />doesn\\'t want to go. Raphael is still gray on that decision, but Donatello wants very much to go. So does April. Leonardo is sort of in the middle. Suddenly, the sceptor is turned on. There is very little time remaining. Back in New York, Casey Jones had really gotten the four warriors that arrived in the turtles\\' places into hockey. He has quite some trouble getting them back, but he does. Michaelangelo is very hesitant and they disappear without him. Back to the sewer. The others find Michaelangelo gone, but he soon arrives. He\\'s saddened about leaving his new friends and says he\\'ll never smile again. That changes thanks to Splinter wearing a lamp shade and pretending to be Elvis.<br /><br /> This movie wasn\\'t as good as the others. On change is that now Leonardo is the joke maker. He used to be the serious one, but now he\\'s making jokes with the rest of them. Also, Corey Feldman is back! He couldn\\'t make Part II because he was in rehab, getting off his heroine addiction. I\\'m glad Elias Koteas returns as Casey Jones. Movie probably would\\'ve been better if Casey had had a more major role in it. Anyway, I say it isn\\'t as good as the othe',\n"," 'never before have i seen such a tale of such talentless hangers on been so ungrateful that their golden goose has failed to lay. these spunk monkeys are parasites and bad examples of friends. i felt sorry for troy as he tried to hook up all of his friends with Hollywood gigs, but as soon as things turned sour, they all left troy hanging. overnight was a contrived effort of self indulgent retribution on a man who was going up against the forces of Hollywood to retain story integrity.

You have to have a good story, good acting, doesn't have to be brilliant acting, but at least some sort of effort has to be made by the actors to entertain. I wasted my money on this film and I am not happy. I even asked the theater for my money back and they gave me a free pass for another movie. And I wasn't the only one suckered into this. Others were asking for their money back too and I saw at least six people walk out of the theater during the show.

It doesn't take a lot of imagination to figure out the general direction the plot will take, but Kay makes makes her metamorphosis from sweet young thing to party girl quite believable. The rest of the cast is at least adequate, but it's really Kay's movie all the way. <br /><br />The plot has some clever, if improbable, twists and the timing coincidences are beyond belief even for Hollywood. Not a great film, but definitely worth a look for pre-Code aficionados and Francis fans.\",\n"," 'Having been allowed behind the scene access during this tour, I have to say that everything you see in these videos truly portrays JJ Cale in the most accurate way possible.<br /><br />The film moves slow, sometimes to the point of boring.

Definitely something to look up to considering his financial wealth.<br /><br />The interviews with Eric Clapton are great. He puts Cale on a pedestal (so to say) and credits him properly. I admire that.<br /><br />This film has finally been released in the US as well and definitely worth a look for those interested in the Tulsa Sound, the roots of popular music, and of course, JJ Cale himself.',\n"," 'I started watching Hollywood movies 6 years back, watched some of the greatest classics and blockbusters of all times. Was amazed and awestruck that how was Hollywood capable of churning out such amazing stuff with such amazing consistency...but after seeing \"Bad boys\" and a few other disappointing movies, I realized that Hollywood too, wasn\\'t perfect. Coming to the movie, the plot was an oft repeated one of two cops pairing up, both different in personas (infact diametrically opposite), and still great pals, one has a wife and kids and other is single and hot, the usual clichés. But that\\'s not all that is bad about the movie..., there is more-the silly dialogues, lousy work by the lead pair, the female lead has no clue what to say or do, she often keeps mumbling and muttering in the background. Above all, the scenes are illogical and can\\'t be attributed to be the actions of sane people. Martin Lawrence does ok in his role, but maybe he could have done better if he hadn\\'t tried to fake that dialogue delivery style which looked very irritating and totally lacking in humor. Comic timing and wisecracks have to be differentiated from silly mannerisms, and this movie is a big example of that. Will Smith, is a little more subdued...but isn\\'t able to emote much or come up with funny stuff. Téa Leoni has no role in the movie, she acts in the craziest, most insensible ways, invites trouble each time(if it was real life, she would have been killed the first time she tried to pull off those stupid stunts of hers), not to mention the male leads who too are guilty of this!!! The wife too is shown as an irrational human being who would make unjustified demands on his apparently busy husband. The movie is about the most irrational and stupid people we are ever going to come across. They do all sorts of crazy and suicidal things at the silliest pretext and dumbest logic!!! I hope there are no people of such kind anywhere in the universe. About the director, he must realize that a movie can be comic even though it has intelligent people in it, everything doesn\\'t have to be so dumb. Besides, showing African Americans in such clichéd roles just tarnishes their image. THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THE MOVIE is the action scenes, and occasional good comedy. So, my advice is, if u have better things to do in life, don\\'t watch it. If u really have to watch a movie, then rent some old favorite rather than go for it. GOD SAVE YOU.',\n"," '-and I say that being a person whose hated musicals all his life with a fiery passion<br /><br />-The movie chronicles the events that takes place after the gang sneaks in to see an R rated movie. the movie is based on their favorite Canadian TV show \"Terrence and Phillips: Asses of Fire.\" the movie contains lots of crude humor and vulgar language, and teaches them how to use the F word and other offensive language in a brand new way. pretty soon all the kids see the movie and start cussing like sailors, and this is where the problem comes from. all the parents lead by Kyle\\'s mom decide to protest the movie and the protest soon turns into an all out war between Canada and USA. meanwhile Kenny dies and ends up in hell and whiles there he discovers that Satan and his boyfriend Saddam Hussein *LOL* are plotting to invade earth. and that\\'s the f*cked up plot in a nutshell<br /><br />-The whole movie is told through a series of wonderful songs sang by the characters. from the Danny Elfmanesque \"Blame Canada\" to the laugh out loud \"Kyle\\'s Mom\\'s A *female dog*\" all the songs in the movie are just perfect and fits it like a glove. the humor is the same as that of the TV show, and by that i mean stereotypical racial jokes, fart jokes, gay jokes, pop culture jokes, and sexual jokes. the animation is also the same which must be great news for the studio because by doing that the movie was made very cheaply. Trey and Matt like always do the voices for about 70% of the characters in the movie, but this time they have some celebrity friends to help them out. I heard that Clooney did a voice for the movie but i couldn\\'t recognize it.

No wonder Left Wing critic Roger Ebert loved this movie; it's right up his political alley, too.<br /><br />Unlike the reviewers here, I am glad Judd elevated herself from this moronic fluff to better roles in movies that entertained, not preached the heavy-handed Liberal agenda.\",\n"," \"This film was an interesting take by Hollywood on the novel by of the same name by Pearl S. Buck. While some today might think it is rife with racial stereotypes, for the time the very idea of Chinese protagonists was progressive in and of itself. I found that the white actors playing Chinese was not as bad as I expected, that it wasn't the Asian equivalent of blackface. Back then there were not really any Asian actors in America (not even George Takei was acting) and Rainer did a good job with her part. It wasn't the greatest performance I have ever seen but for old-school pre-method acting it was nice. The locust scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects.<br /><br />I wonder that the timing of the release during the Great Depression sort of turns this film into an allegory. Especially the political upheaval bewildering the peasant farmers and how them seem to be left behind by all of it.<br /><br />The film had some parallels to the John Ford style, but I think the Eastern influence affected it as well. If this had been an western family, the locusts would have won at the end, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust, and gluttony.

All the performances here are excellent: Season Hubley as Priscilla, Pat Hingle as the Colonel, even Shelley Winters brings the right level of nerves and hysteria to her rendering of Momma Presley.<br /><br />Kurt's dad Bing is here playing Elvis' father Vernon, and there's a fine understated performance from Robert Gray as Elvis' buddy and bodyguard Red West. <br /><br />A must see for rock n roll fans.\",\n"," \"All i hear about is how poorly the animation is done.

Instead, it's a poorly acted, witless look into low budget and uninspired film making. The plot is absurd and the acting excruciatingly stiff and amateurish. John Miles, who had a rather thin resume in the industry, grins and guffaws throughout, and everyone else acts with the same verve as characters in a government-made filmstrip about driver safety. The movie anticipates shows like 'Leave it to Beaver' and 'Father Knows Best' in its unnaturally wholesome view of New York in 1950. Why, the viewer doesn't even get to see anyone light up a cig until some shapely woman is interviewed in a flophouse halfway through the movie. The only thing the movie has going for it (besides its brevity) is the excellent location shots coordinated by William Steiner. The low budget of the film works in the cinematographer's favor, as the viewer is treated to well-framed shots of New York City's interiors and expansive exteriors. Unless you wish to enjoy the film for the choice of settings and camera angles, I suggest watching practically any other movie.\",\n"," \"One of eastwood's best movies after he had separated himself from the westerns. which in themselves were good whenever I had a chance to see any of clint's earlier work I would sit in front of the set and watch whatever was on.\",\n"," 'Having just recently re-viewed \"Lipstick\" for the first time in a few decades, I backed it with \"Descent\" even though I have heard more negative comments than good from other film friends with tastes as varied as mine.<br /><br />It\\'s interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the Rape Revenge movie has evolved in the past 32 years, from the full-on gore of \"I Spit On Your Grave,\" to the tawdry sensationalism of \"Lipstick,\" to the tasteful handling of the issue in \"The Accused.\" But \"Descent,\" though making some important points, never really offers us anything truly new in terms of revelatory meaning. No, \"Descent\" is so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that it detracts from any significant message it could hope to make --- a message that, when examined closely, isn\\'t that groundbreaking.<br /><br />I pretty much knew the plot going in. What I wanted to see *was* the \"descent\" or degeneration of Dawson\\'s character. Being a big fan of Rosario\\'s, I was anxious to see the layers being stripped away and her psyche being slowly twisted...you know, the kind of portrayal DeNiro brings to \"Taxi Driver.\" Unfortunately, the script and the director/writer\\'s choices don\\'t provide any sort of believable transition.<br /><br />The biggest point of failure is the second act. It became obvious what the filmmaker\\'s intentions were for this segment of club-hopping, drug use, and obsession with big black stallion Adrian (every white boy\\'s nightmare, natch) from a Q&A on the DVD, but this excursion into Dawson\\'s character is never believably rendered. We don\\'t know exactly what the hell she\\'s doing half the time, what she\\'s after, or why she\\'s doing it. The poor quality of the audio/video again don\\'t help, but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless. It destroys any momentum and investment in the lead character set up during the otherwise exceptionally well-done first act. By the time we get to the finale, our interest has already waned.<br /><br />One point of success that Dawson does point out in the Q&A is that by the end \"revenge\" scene we are pumped for retribution, then realize just how drawn-out and ugly the reality is. While that\\'s certainly valid, it doesn\\'t make the scene any more intriguing.<br /><br />If you have the DVD, check out the deleted \"classroom\" scene. This is an excellent 8 minute plus outtake that crackles with energy and provocation (though all verbal) and really DOES show Dawson\\'s slow crack-up materializing as she delightfully vivisects poor Francie Swift\\'s prissy, condescending dorm counselor. If more expository scenes like this had been added and more of the middle third cut down, we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violence.<br /><br />As the film stands in the final cut, though, all we get is what we\\'ve seen before, only in a more graphic rendering. So what?',\n"," 'This film was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. It was sort of a remake but then again, not really. I was very disappointed considering the tools that Tim Burton has at his disposal. He had great make up and CGI available and lots of money ($100 million) but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was made for less than $6 million? Heck no. So in that regard, the film fails.<br /><br />At least in the original film, the statue of liberty scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking in this film even the end scene because you could kind of see it coming. And, by the way, if you give it some thought, and I did, you can figure out how the ending could come about. I just wish I had back the time that I wasted thinking about it.<br /><br />This film would have been brilliant and fun if it stayed along the lines of the first film and adopted part of \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\". Here\\'s how I would have written it:<br /><br />An astronaut (it really should have been more than Marky Mark because he\\'s not good enough to care a film all by himself so I would have put in three guys) that would land on what they would think would be another planet, encounter humans (not mutes), a city ruled by apes, were hunted, made friends with some good apes, discover that they\\'re on earth via finding some destroyed ruins, end up running into crazy mutant humans living beneath the earth, a war breaks out between the mutant humans and the apes, and then....well, let your imagination run wild on how you want to end it.<br /><br />But my point is that there could have been so much more to this film. Sadly, Tim Burton really knows how to wreck a good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He\\'s a rotten director inspite what of people think.

This movie had every cliche imaginable: teenage pregnancy, divorce, marriage, birth, death, car accident. If reading that seemed random, try watching it. It\\'s ridiculous. Oh, and I neglected to mention the pot smoking grandmother.<br /><br />Here are a few examples about what just didn\\'t work in this movie:<br /><br />About 10-15 minutes into the film, a boy collapses on the soccer field. He\\'s clutching his stomach, and my friend and I both immediately thought, \"Oh, appendicitis.\" Next shot (this is after he passes out and people are surrounding him), he\\'s on the ground clutching his chest.

He refused to leave,insisting that the lava could not reach that far, an that the hotel was the safest place to be. Quite a few others followed his lead. We never saw the lava reach the hotel. It was destroyed when the volcano blew its top again, shooting out a few tons of fiery rock which arced high in the air and, much against the odds, scored a bullseye. It seems the hotel owner was right, the odds were better on staying, even if they didn't come off. <br /><br />All in all, one to miss. But why, you might ask, if it was that bad, why did you watch it for long enough to find all these faults. I wish I knew. <br /><br />\",\n"," 'Absolutely the worst piece of crap my brother and I have seen. The movie looked to be an interesting action movie early on, but became totally unbelievable and stupid as the movie progressed. It simply insults the intelligence of the viewer! People in the audience were laughing at how dumb, and I mean dumb, this movie was. The acting was horrible. The plot, what plot? The \"marine\" was indestructible. The bad guys fought among themselves and acted like a bunch of morons. After intense fighting scenes, the characters didn\\'t have scratches or torn clothing. Everything was predictable. I honestly can not recall seeing a movie as bad as this one. The producer of this movie should be ashamed! Absolutely do not recommend wasting even a dollar at a dollar theater for this one!',\n"," 'Not sure if this is just a lousy movie or if it was intended to be a mockery of a \"B\" Western. Story line was so-so but the filming, editing and acting were just plain bad. Plus the music in the background was irritating to no end, too loud and just non-stop. Many times you could not make out the dialog over the background music. I\\'m in SASS (Single Action Shooting Society) and do some Old West shooting with them, and a lot of the actors are members of this group, so that\\'s why I bought it. If you have no interest in this group of people, or that sport, you certainly most likely wouldn\\'t even have this little bit of interest to help out with the film. The acting of even the veteran actors (particularly Stella Stevens) left a lot to be desired also.',\n"," 'If you liked this movie, be sure to check out others directed by Hrebejk - you are in for a treat. This is unfortunately not his best, but still million times better than an average movie from the mainstream cinema. It explores relationships, especially the abusive ones, has some powerful as well as sweet moments and great acting. Some plot inconsistencies, clichés and hollow moments spoil the overall effect. To the previous reviewer and his comments on the Czech psyche: an interesting approach, but I do not see this movie becoming a Czech blockbuster. Those folks are rather spoiled by their movie makers {check out also stuff by Sverak, Gedeon} and this one lags a bit behind.',\n"," '\"The Year My Voice Broke\" is one of those unknown, quintessential diamond-in-the-rough films that can\\'t seem to find its way into the DVD market, but breaths Criterion throughout the entire viewing. The daring, honest, and descriptive story of a young boy, his love for this older girl, and the tribulations of growing up in a small town are merely scratching the surface to what this film has to offer. It speaks, and pays homage, to those classic films from the late 40s, early 50s by creating a town with character, mythology, and individuality. One could argue that the town in which this film takes place is our fourth character, behind Danny, Freya, and Trevor \\x96 but perhaps this enthusiast is getting ahead of himself. Watching this import on a used VHS, the picture was grainy, the player made noise, and the sound was utterly destructive \\x96 yet the heart of this film oozed from the screen. The power of the characters, the detail of our story, and the truth in director/screenwriter John Duigan\\'s words went from having meaning in a 1987 film (that was supposed to take place in 1962) to creating a story that didn\\'t feel dated or old watching it today, at the end of 2009. That is the legacy of \"The Year My Voice Broke\", the raw emotion harassed in this film continues to be relevant today \\x96 perhaps even more. As Hollywood uses every CGI possible to recreate the same effect, all one needs to do is look back at films that used the old-fashioned method\\x85great actors, a daring script, and a background that could knock your socks off.<br /><br />To applaud this film, one would need to pat the back of a very young, a very talented, Noah Taylor. Taking on not just an awkward role, he needed to show his anger, his teenage frustration, as well as his headiness for brains instead of brawn. Noah Taylor, known to me as Technical Support in \"Vanilla Sky\", succeeded gracefully and with the power of most of our top paid American stars. His ability to show us his unconditional love for Freya, his quizzical hatred for Trevor, as well as his sleuthing skills proved that this kid was ready for anything. His co-workers inhabiting each scene worked with his dynamic and equally pushed their talents. Freya, played by Loene Coleman, a newbie to the screen, was enchanting as the love interest. While she wasn\\'t quite the level of Mr. Taylor, her ability to carry her scenes worked. She was the classical bad-girl-next-door with secrets. Her chemistry with Taylor kept me glued to the screen. The same can be said for Trevor, played by Ben Mendelsohn, who\\'s diabolical, nearly irritating, laugh created a character all his own. As the wildcard, we never knew what he was going to do next, and both our characters and our audience were scared of that. To demonstrate the intensity of these actors, watch closely the scene in which they spend the night in the \"haunted\" house near the railroad tracks. Each one has a motive, each actor/character delivers their emotion, and with each line the scene gets more and more powerful. I wasn\\'t expecting this with children so young.<br /><br />With these three dominate characters; one may ask what else would be needed for an independent film to succeed? One more, the town. As mentioned before, the town that these three (and many others) reside is reminiscent of our American \"Bedford Falls\". There are residents that have been their all their lives and secrets many of them keep to protect their town. Throughout the film, our characters are continually building their moments via smaller lives within the town. We learn about Danny\\'s passion for the black arts, that Trevor knows the police firsthand, and that Freya\\'s unknown secret keeps the town at bay. Without the closeness of this town, \"The Year My Voice Broke\" wouldn\\'t have worked. If filmed in a bigger city, the intimate feeling of a protective yet destructive town would have floundered. The town drunk would have been less poignant, Danny\\'s dad\\'s role would have felt less personal, and the idea of home being safe would have felt less comforting. The town had to be a character in this film. Duigan knew it, developed it, and built it strongly into his film.<br /><br />This was a character driven film. Without Noah Taylor, Loene Coleman, or Ben Mendelsohn, this film would have failed. It is hard to imagine anyone else being able to carry these characters, or that an American reality would pack as much of a punch. It was impressive to see Australia in 1962, a place we don\\'t explore in cinema enough over past centuries. Director Duigan, if I haven\\'t already drooled over him enough, understood this film, wrote a genuine story, and built a cinematic triumph. Alas, this film has been forgotten, but look closely at the cinematography, the lavish landscapes, the devotion of our characters, the above mentioned town \\x96 these all could not have been accomplished without a passionate eye. I applaud Duigan for his talent and ability to transform this 1980s film into a universally emotional and exciting moment of cinema.<br /><br />Overall, I have said enough. I loved this movie. It was detailed, emotional, and beautiful. Everyone, from director to actors performed superbly. It was a rough couple of prior films, but \"The Year My Voice Broke\" provided that classic niche. It felt fresh and new, despite the age. I recommend this to everyone. Buy a VHS player and get a copy of this movie, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Grade: **** 1/2 out of *****',\n"," 'You know, I\\'ve never been a big fan of rap culture, but I thought that the film in question, \"Stop Snitchin\\', Stop Lying\", while it does have some incredibly stupid and/or unintentionally hilarious parts, actually was enjoyable enough for me to watch all the way through. Basically, the film chronicles rapper The Game ( I will call him Mr. Watkins from now on, because that\\'s his real name) as he goes on his \"world tour\" (now that I think about it, I don\\'t think he went anywhere except for Norway and the U.S., but what do I know), and tries to find 50 Cent, so he can try to get him to explain why he ratted out a member of the group (I think that\\'s what it was). Along the way, Mr. Watkins explains his life story to the audience, gets arrested in North Carolina, meets a veritable group of fans from all over the U.S., and tries to dispel the rumors of his breakup with 50 Cent and the \"G-Unit\" (to which Mr. Watkins now effectively calls the \"G-UNOT\"). Needless to say, it does get a little dry at times, and there are parts which are funny like you wouldn\\'t believe (Atkins making an impassioned plea to 50 Cent to help him release Irv Gotti, the supposed \"re-enactment\" of 50 Cent confessing to a police officer, the guy being driven around yelling at some woman who is supposedly a man) and the video quality is very shoddy. However, the one thing I took away from this experience is that Mr. Watkins genuinely loves his fans. And, bless his soul, he seems to do a lot for them. We see in this film that Watkins personally reads fan mail and signs copies of every album sent to him (before sending them back), and that he\\'s not above meeting new faces and friends on the street. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen one rap artist do that, and, to be honest, when Mr. Watkins said he was doing all this for the fans, I believed him. He may get a bad rap because of his narcissistic and childish demeanor, and he may be a very rich person, but he loves his work and the people who respect his work, and personally, I think that\\'s the only thing that matters.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you\\'re a fan of The Game or of rap music in general, give this one a look. It\\'s a heck of a lot better than that \"Get Rich Or Die Trying\" film.',\n"," \"I just saw this film at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham, AL, which was actually a really fun festival, and was blown away by it. It was the best movie I saw all day by a long shot. A school aged prostitute meets with a middle age man and attempt to end there deep depression together. It's an inner look into the darkest parts of human sexuality. Story stems from real life occurrences, ripped straight from the headlines. Raw, blunt dialog and a killer twist at the end. The film does contain graphic sexual dialog and nudity. Definitely not suitable for kids. Too depressing for some people's tastes. Definitely worth checking out in my opinion though.\",\n"," 'am a hardcore horror/thriller fan...when i was searchin for good horror flick to scare me on my weekend night..grabbed HATCHET..with impressing BLOOD STAINED HATCHET movie poster added to average ratings in IMDb..but i was wrong after watchin this crap...no characterisation..sick dialogues,with sexy babes bared boobs. i got the feel of watchin porno certainly..and the substory which so called main theme or suspense of the story SUCKS big time....and here comes the CLOWN wearin funny mask to scare..THINK users rated this movie went nuts ..it deserves 1 out of 10 i give 2 for bare boobs babes n soundtrack it has...',\n"," 'I was just a lad of ten when I saw this 1973 BBC production of \"Jane Eyre\" for the first time. Michael Jayston and, above all, Sorcha Cusack made an everlasting impression on me. After all these years, to be able to see her again as Jane is... all joy! <br /><br />To acknowledge how well both these actors did portray their respective characters from Robin Chapman\\'s fine script and under Joan Craft\\'s competent direction, allow to remind you here the following excerpts from Charlotte Brontë\\'s immortal novel: - from chapter XIV (Jane about Rochester): \"(...) he rose from his chair (...)\"; - and from chapter XXVII (Rochester to/about Jane): \"(...) You entered the room (...)\" In these two passages of her novel, Charlotte Brontë gave to all readers a crystal-clear synthesis of how she imagined Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester; and it is exactly this we have the exquisite privilege to contemplate in the 1973 BBC production of \"Jane Eyre\". <br /><br />Please, believe me: in no other production you will find these characters portrayed so faithfully to the novel and so perfectly on screen as in this one! Michael Jayston is a great, truly great Rochester; Sorcha Cusack, with that beautiful round face, those lovely eyes and that velvet voice, is a Jane from the other world; and the connection between them is genuine empathy - just like the connection there is between their respective characters. <br /><br />The portrayal of the secondary characters is made in much the same way. The performances of Isabelle Rosin as Adèle, of Megs Jenkins as Mrs. Fairfax, of Stephanie Beecham as Blanche Ingram, and of Geoffrey Whitehead as St. John Rivers, are all very good and quite close to what can we read in \"Jane Eyre\".<br /><br />The real marrow of Charlotte Brontë\\'s novel: this is what one can get from this, the 1973 BBC production of \"Jane Eyre\". Nothing of real importance is missing here - above all, God. The final lines said by Sorcha Cusack, taken out of the last chapter of novel (sadly missing in all the other TV and movie versions), are a sort of resume of Charlotte Brontë\\'s faith in God: after helping both Jane and Rochester going through their ordeals, God blesses her supremely and judges him with mercy; so, there is reason to believe in God. <br /><br />Just like the novel, this TV production is a story told by Jane\\'s own point of view: it\\'s a \"flash-back\". The use of narration through Jane\\'s \"inner-voice\" is as effective here as it is old in the History of English Theatre: it harks back to William Shakespeare, who used to make his characters turn to the audiences and speak out their intimate thoughts. <br /><br />Drama and humor, suspense and surprise are all very finely balanced in this BBC production of \"Jane Eyre\". As for the humor, I don\\'t mean to be rude to those reviewers whom have written elsewhere criticizing Sorcha Cusack\\'s performance, but I\\'m afraid they simply don\\'t grasp British humor - particularly, the \"understatement\", which is present in almost every line of many of the intimate dialogs between Jane and Rochester (both in the novel and in this production).<br /><br />It should be noted that this is neither a \"romantic\" nor a \"Gothic\" production of Charlotte Brontë\\'s novel. In fact, I\\'m not even sure that \"Jane Eyre\" is a true romantic or a true Gothic novel. As far as I remember, it was Jorge Luis Borges who stated that it could be classified as one of the predecessors of the so-called \"Magic Realism\" in Literature. Indeed, between \"Romanticism\", \"Gothicism\" and \"Magic Realism\", I personally find \"Jane Eyre\" much closer to the latter...<br /><br />To my mind, in a scale of 1 to 10, the 1973 BBC production of \"Jane Eyre\" deserves 9.9. It would get a clear 10 out of me if it had (as it should!) at least fifteen episodes; but, since it was a \"low budget\" production, it has only five - and, because of that, the \"gipsy scene\" had to be pruned up to the point of becoming just a hilarious scene, and the character of Rosamond Oliver had to be simply tossed off.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it is the best of all screen versions there are of \"Jane Eyre\": the most faithful to novel, superbly tight and paced, very well put up together, with first class performances and Elgar\\'s Introduction and Allegro for strings, Opus 47 (1904-05), as the musical background.<br /><br />In short, it is a sublime piece of Art. Don\\'t miss it!...',\n"," 'If you find yourself in need of an escape, something that will hold your attention for two hours and allow you to be lost in another world, Domino will satisfy that need. This is entertainment, after all! The plot keeps your brain in motion - one of those movies (like Usual Suspects) where you want to see it a second time to figure it all out. I wondered about Domino Harvey herself, how her life became of interest to Hollywood. As for the acting, lots of celebrity appearances not shown in the trailers. And any actor that makes me forget who they are has done their job well. Not once did I think of Kiera in a soccer uniform or pirate costume. And granted, Mickey Rourke plays Mickey Rourke well and often, but here, despite the violence, he shows signs of being capable of caring for other people.',\n"," \"When I first watched it, I thought it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I mean, the story is great. I absolutely love the storyline. I still think so today. But as for the movie, that's another story.<br /><br />I've read the mangas. I'm not exactly a big fan of CLAMP's work, but this one is the first that I got into with the mangas. I fell in love with one of the characters in the story name Subaru Sumeragi. Favorite character for obvious reason, but if you like any character other than Kamui or Fuuma, then you're in for the biggest disappointment if you watch this movie. OK, to get to the point, this is basically stuffing all the series of the manga into one movie. You won't have time to get to know the characters if you didn't know them already. You just won't get to. Well, they at least explain a bit of their purpose in life for a few seconds. Also, they failed to explain a lot of things about the movie, so that's another big disappointment. Er, and another big disappointment is that, they change some of the character's personality! ANOTHER big disappointment is that they didn't put some of the good story lines in the mangas into the movie. I know that doesn't seem like a big deal and I would like to give an example. There's this one character who loves another character from the other angel (they're enemies angels), but in the movie, they hate each other. So that's what I mean.<br /><br />But wait, there's a good! The good is that the animation is great. Beautiful and artistic like all of CLAMP's work. It's realistic in animation, and the way it was done was just, wow. even though they lack everything else, but it was still nicely done in animation wise. Now if only the series was done the same way. Oh yeah, the music is great also.<br /><br />Even though I like the story and how it was animated, I just didn't want to sit through it anymore. Once was enough. So I gave it a 4/10\",\n"," 'The title for this review about sums up how I feel about this movie. I can\\'t imagine what audience there would be for this thing, if not for the die-hard fan of 1980s slasher films who simply has to see -everything- from that era. Otherwise, don\\'t even waste your time on this.<br /><br />The story is similar to most films of its type: something awful happens to one of the characters in the opening scene, which inspires a bloodthirsty killer to go on a murderous rampage. Been there, done that. Truth be told, none of these \\'80s slashers were known for their originality, so I can\\'t see the point in harping on the film simply for this.<br /><br />But where the film fails is in its suspense and murder sequences. I\\'ve seen some pretty scary slasher movies from the 1980s that had far lower budgets than this. This one just fails to create any real suspense. The director throws in some nice camera angles and some semi-professional directorial touches here and there, but they mean nothing if you\\'re not frightened. The gore is pretty tame as well, so anyone who watches these things with the intention of seeing some cool 1980s makeup effects will be sadly disappointed.<br /><br />The movie manages to clunk along rather dully. Honestly, the key ingredient to almost any slasher is the tight pacing--you have to keep things moving along swiftly and keep the murder set pieces staged at regular intervals, because, let\\'s face it, we don\\'t watch these things for the great characterization and stellar plots. But the pacing, whether due to the script or the editor, is all off. The murders are spaced out at odd intervals, leaving us with some long-winded scenes (no doubt meant to build \"character\") that serve only to bore you and leave you praying for the next kill (which, as I\\'ve said, usually isn\\'t executed all that well anyway).<br /><br />As for the killer, don\\'t expect anything original or even remotely frightening. He (or she?) wears a jogging suit, a fencing mask, and his (or her?) primary weapon is a sword. I bet the writer just wet himself over thinking he came up with an original, \"cool\" murder weapon, but the idea just comes off as impractical and silly. There\\'s also not much emphasis placed on the \"whodunnit\\' nature of the film, as if they either forgot or don\\'t care to place any red herrings in the mix to throw us off.<br /><br />I have the sense that the people behind this were trying to make something decent and respectable, and at times, it shows their intentions were probably a bit more genuine in regards to making a quality film as opposed to countless other knockoff slashers from the era. But alas, the attempt fails for the most part. There is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film). There is attempt at characterization, but none of it ends up meaning anything in the end, so...what a waste. Here, all it manages to do is bog down the plot and make the murder sequences feel like they can\\'t come soon enough.<br /><br />In the end, if you\\'re really into these old \\'80s slashers, by all means, check it out, if only to say you\\'ve seen it. There\\'s a completest in all of us. But don\\'t expect to be blown away or anything. What we have here is a very mildly entertaining slasher movie that leaves no real impression at all.',\n"," \"Emily Watson's Natalia is absolutely the most loving and romantic lead character I have ever seen on a screen. She is the queen of this film beyond all doubt. Or, is she transmuted to the king? The internecine weaving of the chess games and the families' struggles for control, power, and victory is stunning. Just as the chess masters in the film do, the director is playing many simultaneous games with our mind at once, but all weave into either major or minor patterns. The period, the costumes, and imagery of early 20th century Italy's lake district is captured magnificently. Not a single square of space is wasted.<br /><br />So many brilliant scenes abound, I cannot recount them all. I recommend budgeting enough time to watch this movie twice, possibly a week apart, because you can't possibly capture all the poetry within a 64-square yet multi-dimensional framework in one setting. <br /><br />I did not read Nabakov's book, but to try an analogy of my own, what I am reading reminds of me of another romantically triumphant poetry-as-game movie, Barry Levinson's The Natural. It totally jettisoned the downbeat ending of Bernard Malamud's fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely American. Well, the director did that one better by seamlessly meshing Russian and Italian morals and mores as a backdrop to enlightenment. The true story here is that games are zero-sum; there is a winner and a loser, unless both contestants draw. But, in life, and especially in the context of our immortal souls, we are only limited by those constraints and life's conventions to the extent we let others break our spirit. <br /><br />Pure love, as personified by Emily Watson's Natalia, can transcend and allow all of us to be enhanced by its gifts simultaneously. Only the barriers erected by our fears can cut us off from it.<br /><br />This is a magnificent movie (10/10).\",\n"," 'Yeah, OK, this may be deliberately cheesy but it\\'s all pretty lousy, and not in a good way.

Okay, I'm not good at telling people apart at best, and when they're all young men, about the same ages, general build, and height and all wearing very similar suits, my ability at identifying them goes waaaaay down. I know that plays into the plot, but it also added to my confusion as a viewer.<br /><br />The film also failed to clarify why the characters were doing what they were doing.<br /><br />First we have the three young men, who are borderline still boys, who are wearing suits and hats and driving one of the lad's father's black Cadillac, without permission. Beautiful car - as this film was set in the late 1950's, back when cars were cars, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />The boys think it would be great fun to pretend to shoot someone and then stuff him in the trunk and drive off - shocking numerous people who will witness the incident. One of them is to play the part of the man who gets shot.<br /><br />However, their prank goes awry.<br /><br />Then we have more confusion. Like why does Leon (Stephen Baldwin)hold the two boys captive and torture them? Why doesn't he just drive off in the Cadillac and carry on with the planned bank robbery? I never understood that.<br /><br />Why the bit with a gangster coming into the bank and pretending he's with the FBI? Was that the way Florence thought he could get away with the money without being pursued by the police, or what? <br /><br />Then we have a totally unbelievable sex scene between one of the boys and a female bank employee, following him kidnapping her and waving a gun at her. Yeah, the guy was nice looking, but gee whiz I'd think making out wouldn't exactly be the first thing on their minds given their tense situation, and the fact he has some cuts and bruises. The cops are out looking for them, and they've double-crossed some dangerous criminals.<br /><br />Then when Florence finally shows up out at the fort where Leon is, Leon, who has already been blubbering, which seemed completely out of character for him, does still more bawling around, and Florence sort of comforts him in a rough kind of way. So were the two of them lovers, or what? <br /><br />We discover Carol is really Patty, and then she hops a freight train?! She didn't even know she was going to be out there by the train tracks - after all the original plan didn't involve driving out to the fort. So what was her original plan?

Mac likes the idea & sets out recruiting a gang to pull it off, the muscle is supplied by Bert Clinger (Ernest Borgnine), the wheel man is Harry Kifka (Jack Klugman), the weapons man & shooter is Dave Negli (Donald Sutherland) & the professional hi-tech thief, lock picker & safe-cracker is Marty Gough (Warren Oates). Everything is prepared & the day of the heist arrives...<br /><br />Directed by Gordon Flemyng this late 60's crime heist action thriller is unfairly rather obscure but is worth the effort to track a copy down, although you can compare The Split to The Italian Job (1969) since they are both 60's heist films The Split was made & released a year before. The script by Robert Sabaroff was based on the novel 'The Seventh' by Donald E. Westlake can be divided into three chunks, the first third of the film revolves around the recruiting of the team with some fun set-pieces to make sure each member is up to the task, the second third of the film is my favourite when they carry out the heist & there's that feeling that you root for them & you want to get away with it & all the close calls they have & watching the plan unfold is pretty fun, then the final third of the film is perhaps the weakest as several random events come together & tear the thieves apart & it becomes a rather dull runaround after the money which goes missing through no fault of their own but does obviously cause problems as they don't know who to trust. That's about it really. I would have been happy if The Split had ended after the gang had stolen the money & got away with it but there's this tacked on ending a lot of which feels very random, like how did Ellie's landlord know she had the money? Why leave the money in such an exposed place? Then there's the ending when everyone gets shot & it just all seems rather pointless. The plot wouldn't work now of course, what with the amount of CCTV's & security, the fact a lot of people pay by credit card & I don't understand why the gang don't try to cover their faces. They rob the place without any mask's or gloves so if the hostages don't identify them their finger prints surely would? For such a well planned robbery that's quite a big oversight, isn't it?<br /><br />Director Flemyng does a good job, he keeps the film moving along & it always feels like something is happening. The character's are also very good with each member of the gang having a distinct personality & getting at least a few minutes screen time to develop it although McClain is hard to like as the lead character since he only seems interested in serving himself. The Split was apparently the first film to be given an 'R' rating by the MPAA thanks to some fun fights, a few shoot-outs, a bit of mild bad language (although the 'N' word is used here in a casual fashion, something unthinkable these days especially when the IMDb flags it as a 'Prohibited Word' as I have just found out...) & a bit of blood. There's also a neat car chase here as well. It's somewhat surprising that The Split is such an obscure film with it's crowd pleasing heist plot & the top drawer cast but it is, last night I saw a full widescreen 2:35:1 Panavision print of this & while the colours were a bit washed out & a bit pastel it looked very nice.<br /><br />Technically the film is very good, it has good production values, good stunt work & nice cinematography. The one aspect of The Split I don't like is the music, it's horrible & dates the film more than anything else in it. Damn, just look at that cast. There aren't many films that boast a cast as good as The Split. Jim Brown, Ernest Borgnine, Julie Harris, Warren Oates, the peerless Jack Klugman, Donald Sutherland & Gene Hackman. The acting is top notch from one of the best cast of character actors your ever likely to see in the same film.<br /><br />The Split is a good heist film that starts out like The Italian Job but goes in a significantly darker direction although not to the films overall benefit in my opinion. I liked it as a one time watch & the cast are great but I am not sure I would want to see it again anytime soon.\",\n"," 'Director Warren Beatty\\'s intention to turn Chester Gould\\'s famous comic strip into a live-action cartoon (with Beatty himself cast in the lead as the square-jawed detective) had sweet overtures of innocent nostalgia--quite unusual and intriguing coming from Warren Beatty. Unfortunately, the picture is requisite ham, fun for awhile but eventually tiring. Dick Tracy attempts to bring down mobster Big Boy Caprice, aided by loving Tess Trueheart but tripped up by evil Breathless Mahoney. For the first half-hour or so, the Oscar-winning art direction and set design are wonderful to absorb but, as the plot creaks along predictably (with no real sting in the writing), things begin to congeal. Al Pacino got a surprise Supporting Oscar nomination as bad boy Caprice, and Madonna (who is mostly used as a decorative prop) gets to sing Stephen Sondheim\\'s \"Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)\", which copped the award for Best Original Song. Lots of heart, thanks to Beatty--who was dedicated to his vision--but the picture is too cool and calculated.

Revenge, retribution, manipulation. Marty\\'s usual laying on of the Karo syrup. But unfortunately somewhere in Universal\\'s high-rise a memorandum came down: everyone ham it up.<br /><br />Nolte only speaks with eyebrows raised, Lange bitches her way through cigarettes, Lewis \"Ohmagod\\'s!\" her way though her scenes, and Bobby D...well, he\\'s on a whole other magic carpet. Affecting some sort of Cajun/Huckleberry Hound accent hybrid, he chomps fat cigars and cackles at random atrocities such as \"Problem Child\". And I want you to imagine the accent mentioned above. Now imagine it spouting brain-clanging religious rhetoric at top volume like he swallowed six bibles, and you have De Niro\\'s schtick here. Most distracting of all, though, is his most OVERDONE use of the \"De Niro face\" he\\'s so lampooned for. Eyes squinting, forehead crinkled, lips curled. Crimany, Bob, you looked like Plastic Man.<br /><br />The story apparently began off-screen 14 years earlier, when Nolte was unable to spare De Niro time in the bighouse for various assaults. Upon release, he feels Nolte\\'s misrep of him back then warrants the terrorizing of he and his kin. And we\\'re supposed to give De Niro\\'s character a slight pass because Nolte withheld information that might\\'ve shortened his sentence. De Niro being one of these criminals who, despite being guilty of unspeakable acts, feels his lack of freedom justifies continuing such acts on the outside. Mmm-kay.<br /><br />He goes after Notle\\'s near-mistress (in a scene some may want to turn away from), his wife, his daughter, the family dog, ya know. Which is one of the shortcomings of Wesley Strick\\'s screenplay: utter predictability. As each of De Niro\\'s harassments becomes more gruesome, you can pretty much call the rest of the action before it happens. Strick isn\\'t to be totally discredited, as he manages a few compelling dialogue-driven moments (De Niro and Lewis\\' seedy exchange in an empty theater is the film\\'s best scene), but mostly it\\'s all over-cranked. Scorsese\\'s cartoonish photographic approach comes off as forced, not to mention the HORRIBLY outdated re-worked Bernard Hermann score (I kept waiting for the Wolf Man to show up with a genetically enlarged tarantula).<br /><br />Thus we arrive at the comedic portion of the flick. Unintentionally comedic, that is. You know those scenes where something graphically horrific is happening, but you can\\'t help but snicker out of sight of others? You\\'ll do it here. Nolte and Lange squawking about infidelity, De Niro\\'s thumb-flirting, he cross-dressing, and a kitchen slip on a certain substance that has to be seen to believed. And Bob\\'s infernal, incessant, CONSTANT, mind-damaging, no-end-in sight blowhard ramblings of all the \"philosophy\" he disovered in prison. I wanted him killed to shut him up more than to save this annoying family.<br /><br />I always hate to borrow thoughts from other reviewers, but here it\\'s necessary. This really *is* Scorsese\\'s version of Freddy Krueger. The manner in which De Niro relishes, speaks, stalks, withstands pain, right down to his one-liners, is vintage Freddy. Upon being scalded by a pot of thrown water: \"You trying\\' to offer sumpin\\' hot?\" Please. And that\\'s just one example.<br /><br />Unless you were a fan of the original 1962 flick and want a thrill out of seeing Balsam, Peck, and Mitchum nearly 30 years later (or want a serious head-shaking film experience), avoid a trip to the Cape.',\n"," 'This truly has to be the worst film ever, a bunch of five year olds would surely be able to write a better script, construct more realistic sets and props and act to a higher degree than the actors in this movie seem to have demonstrated and still be more understanding to historical accuracy!<br /><br />And can someone please explain the wigs?

An intelligent & spirited actress, it was roles such as this which would hasten Stanwyck into becoming one of the biggest film stars of the 1930's.<br /><br />A fine cast gives Stanwyck ample support. Ben Lyon plays the free spirited bootlegger who takes a shine to Barbara. Brassy Joan Blondell portrays her worldly wise roommate. Charles Winninger brightens his few scenes as a cherubic doctor, as does Edward Nugent as a flirtatious intern. Vera Lewis is properly implacable as the stern head nurse and Blanche Frederici adds a note of strangeness as a distraught housekeeper. Not yet a star, Clark Gable is very effective as a menacing chauffeur.<br /><br />Movie mavens will recognize Willie Fung as a Chinese patient & Marcia Mae Jones as the sick child who needs the milk bath--both uncredited.<br /><br />The Pre-Code status of the film is readily apparent. Stanwyck & Blondell are viewed in their lingerie as often as possible and Stanwyck must suffer some mighty rough handling from various villains in the movie.

Good luck!',\n"," \"An absolutely wonderful Carne/Prevert jeu d'esprit that owes more to the modernist whimsy of a Rene Clair than the claustrophobic pessimism of their later works. Although acclaimed as the greatest exponents of poetic realism, films like QUAI DES BRUMES and LE JOUR SE LEVE can be seen today as flagrantly artificial, most especially in the sets and almost classical plots. Here, they let the artifice run riot, allowing plots run into strange digressions or non-sequiters. The sense of freedom absent from their more famous works is invigorating.<br /><br />Set in Edwardian England, Archibald Soper is a lecherous, hypocritical, poker-faced bishop who holds sparsely attended public meetings denouncing the evils of detective fiction, apparently an English 'craze' of the time. His cousin, Irwin Molyneaux, is a timid gardener married to a splendidly imperious snob, Margaret. He writes, unknown to his family, hugely successful detective novels under the pseudonym Felix Chapel, with plots pilfered from his maid's hyperactive milkman admirer, Billy.<br /><br />One day, Soper forces himself on the Molyneaux for dinner, but Margaret has exasperated her cooking staff too far, and they have vamoosed. Aghast at the potential humiliation of having no servants, she pretends to be visiting friends and cooks the meal herself. However, Irwin's ineptness at deceit leads Soper to report a murder to Scotland Yard.<br /><br />The film's starting point is the English fondness for detective fiction, and much of the film's humour, its sense of the absurd, its command of farce, its playing with appearance and class, gives the film an English comic eccentricity, rarely found in the French cinema. DROLE, however, is the complete opposite of the typical English detective novel, which offers an opening chaos and enigma, with the social disruption of a crime and a series of wildly disparate clues and leads, but achieves order and social restoration through the figure of the detective who can see, interpret and control everything.<br /><br />In DROLE, following Chesterton, say, rather than Conan Doyle, events start in relative order - characters are firmly set in their social positions. But as the plot proceeds, as characters are revealed to be leading double lives, as the profusion of secondary characters complicates rather than explicates the story, as events become more preposterous and unlikely, the social divisions represented by clear-cut spaces are blurred, and the film<br /><br />escalates into chaos represented by the mob, that great terror of the English, spilling into the narrative, destroying the respectable middle-class home, flouting and mocking the law, making its own judgements. The resolution, such as it is, is a complete lie, because there is no crime, and yet it is brilliantly subversive because it completely disrupts the duplicitous order at the beginning, it alienates people living convenient compartmentalised lives from themselves, forcing them to confront, if only for a moment, their true desires, which contradict their public faces,<br /><br />DROLE is ridiculously funny, and Prevert's arch theatricality has never been used to greater effect. Another plus is one of the most remarkable casts ever assembled - Michel Simon is immensely touching as the bemused gardener forced to abandon the comforts of his mimosa for the chaos of life on the run (private property being the conservative definition of self); Francoise Rosay is incomparable as the grande dame, besotted by social propriety, yet seething with untapped lust; the young Jean-Louis Barrault is a little callow compared to his seasoned elders, but endearingly impudent - the scene in the greenhouse pond with Rosay is a mock-classical treasure.<br /><br />Standing out, though, is possibly the greatest French actor of the 1930s, Louis Jouvet, the funniest straight man in the film, keeping his gloriously calm poker-face through all kinds of humiliations and revelations, including the donning of an elaborate kilt to find an incriminating picture from an 'actress'. Best of all is Carne's style, completely unrestrained, unafraid to go for 'gag'-like effects (the mugging of dandies for buttonholes is particularly piquant), beavering through fairy-tale sets that do for London what TOP HAT did for Venice, completely at ease with the farce, yet still pulling off evocative shots that reveal the emotional reality behind the nonsense.\",\n"," 'i liked the movie and think it was well done. it was not so much about anarchy as it was about the rite of passage into adulthood of one kid. the anarchy and nihilism were just backdrops. the film did a nice job of depicting the journey, the coming of age process, that the main character goes through. puck had a history of being a part of one group or another, and he was very comfortable as part of this anarchist collective. the movie depicts his personal growth, how he begins to reflect and think for himself and become discontent with the collective. he takes a few tentative steps away from the group, and returns - after coming up against challenges when he strikes out on his own or gets pulled back in by other members. finally when it comes down to the line, a crisis situation that is going to affect the rest of his life, he grows into his own skin and decisively chooses his own path.',\n"," 'This is a movie about the music that is currently being played in Istanbul. Istanbul was the center of the two Old World superpowers, the Byzantine Empire and the Ottoman Empire. Today, it is a megalopolis of almost 10 million. So it is to no ones surprise that a lot of music is being played in Istanbul, with a great variety of voices, styles, and influences from everywhere on the globe. It is Turkish music, of course, and I was fascinated by Turkish music ever since I bought my first record long time ago. The movie features different singers, instrumentalists and bands. Spoken comments from the musicians nicely illustrate the music being played, and the social context in modern Turkey. For my perspective, the most interesting comments were from Orhan Gencebay. Furthermore, the movies shows urban scenery mainly from Istanbul which is very pleasant to watch.<br /><br />\"Crossing the Bridge\" is listed as a documentary and it includes music from minorities, e.g. Kurds and Roma. Other important topics are omitted such as Turkish jazz music, or music of the Armenians and Greeks.<br /><br />This movie is strongly recommended for lovers of the music and culture of Turkey, the Balkans, the Eastern Mediterranean, and the Middle East.

Initially, this foursome encounters a desperate father, Frank (Christopher Meloni of \"Runaway Bride\"),and his cute little daughter Jodie (Kiernan Shipka of \"Land of the Lost\") blocking the highway with their SUV. Brian swerves around Frank when he tries to waylay them, but in the process, the oil pan in their Mercedes ruptures and they wind up on foot. Reluctantly, they hitch a ride with Frank after they seal Jodie up in the rear of the SUV. She wears a mask over her nose and mouth and it is speckled with blood. Frank has heard that doctors are curing ailing people at a hospital and they head to it. Sadly, somebody has lied to Frank. The hospital physician is giving the last couple of kids some Kool-Aid that will put them out of their misery. The cure did not improve their condition. Everybody else in town is dead. Kate tries without success to get a dial tone on every phone. Frank realizes that there is no hope for his daughter and he lets the heroic quartet appropriate his SUV and take off.<br /><br />Indeed, \"Carriers\" qualifies as a relentlessly depressing movie about the effects of a pandemic on four sympathetic people who degenerate into homicidal murderers to protect themselves. They reach a country club and frolic around on a golf course until another four show up in suits and masks with pump-action shotguns. Incredibly, our protagonists manage to escape without getting shot, but Brian has a scare when he almost falls into the water with a floating corpse. Eventually, they discover that one of them has become infected. Later, as they are about to run out of gas, Brian blocks the highway like Frank did at the outset. Danny tries to stop a pair of older Christian women driving the car. Danny lies that his pregnant wife is about to give birth and he needs their help. Brian throws caution to the wind and blasts away at the ladies with his automatic pistol when they refuse to help them. Brian catches a slug in the leg from the passenger, but he kills her. <br /><br />No,\"Carriers\" is not a beer & pizza movie that you can either laugh off or laugh with because the humor is virtually non-existent. By the end of this 84-minute movie, our heroes have turned into villains who only care only for themselves and their plight. Chris Pine makes quite an impression as fun-loving Brian and his energetic performance is the only reason to hang with this hokum, while the only other well-known actress, Piper Perabo, is relegated to an inconsequential girlfriend role. As Bobby, she makes tragic the mistake of showing compassion to a dying little girl and pays an awful price. It is a testament to Pine\\'s performance that he can change his character to the point of putting himself before others. Essentially, Pine has the only role that gives him the ability to pull a one-eighty from happy-go-lucky guy to heartless guy. <br /><br />The two directors are Spanish brothers, and they never let the momentum flag. Since there is no relief in sight, \"Carriers\" sinks into predictability. \"Irréversible\" cinematographer Benoît Debie does a fantastic job with his widescreen lensing and as unsavory as this road trip becomes, Debie makes it look like a dynamic film. Aside from the lack of a happy ending or closure in any sense of the word, \"Carriers\" suffers because it is so horribly cynical. The scene when the German shepherd attacks Danny conjures up the most suspense, but even it could have been improved. Unfortunately, the Pastor brothers do not scare up either much tension or suspense. By fade-out, you really don\\'t care what happens to anybody.',\n"," 'An opium den, a dirty little boy (actually a midget), prostitutes galore, a violent fracas in a dive, a motel for sexual shenanigans, scantily clad babes with cleavage a lot, a boozer falling down the stairs, a racially mixed clientèle in a bar with Asians, Africans, and Anglos treated equally, does this sound like a film playing at the local shopping mall? Wrong. These are all scenes from a 1933 musical.<br /><br />The first half of \"Footlight Parade\" is preparation for a musical extravaganza which occupies the last half of the film. Chester Kent (Cagney) is about to lose his job and does lose his playgirl wife as a result of talking pictures squeezing out live stage musicals. His producers take him to see a popular talky of the day, John Wayne in \"The Big Trail.\" Before each showing of the flick, a dance number is presented as a prologue. Shorts, news reels, serials, and cartoons would later serve the purpose. Kent gets the idea that a prologue chain would be the road to salvation for the dwindling live musical business. Kent is basically an idea man along the lines of choreographer Busby Berkeley. Could it be that Cagney\\'s character is patterned after Berkeley? Could be. <br /><br />In preparation for the prologues, Kent learns that his ideas are being stolen by a rival. He uncovers the traitor, fires him, then unbeknown to him a new leak is planted in the form a dazzling temptress. His assistant, Nan Prescott (Joan Blondell - soon to be Mrs. Dick Powell) has the hots for Kent and is determined to expose the wiles of the temptress. A new singer from Arkansas College shows up in the form of Scotty Blain (Dick Powell) who turns out to be a real find and is paired with Bea Thorn (Ruby Keeler). The resulting three prologue musicals, which couldn\\'t possibly have been presented on any cinema stage of the day, are as fresh and enjoyable today as they were over seventy years ago, \"Honeymoon Hotel,\" \"By a Waterfall,\" and \"Shanghai Lil.\"<br /><br />Of special note is the song and dance of tough-guy James Cagney. Like Fred Astaire and Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, Cagney\\'s dancing appeared natural and unrehearsed, although hours went into practice to get each step just right. Not as good a singer as Astaire, Cagney\\'s singing, like Astaire\\'s, sounded natural, unlike the crooning so popular at the time. It\\'s amazing that one person could be so talented and so versatile as James Cagney.<br /><br />Most critics prefer the \"Shanghai Lil\" segment over the other two. Yet the kaleidoscopic choreography of \"By a Waterfall\" is astonishing. How Berkeley was able to film the underwater ballets and to create the human snake chain must have been difficult because it has never been repeated. The close up shots mixed brilliantly with distant angles is a must-see. The crisp black and white photography is much more artistic than it would have been if shot in color. <br /><br />Though not nearly as socially conscious as \"Gold Diggers of 1933,\" \"Footlight Parade\" stands on its own as one of the most amazing and outrageous musicals ever put on the big screen.',\n"," 'Shame Shame Shame on UA/DW for what you do! <br /><br />I was appalled. <br /><br />Do NOT take kids to see this movie.

The score just plain sucked.<br /><br />The second problem, which I see as quite severe as well as it involves the unwinding of the plot near the end of the film (one of the the money shots, if you will), is the dialogue between Martha (Adrienne Barbeau) and the sunflower man (Richard Ziman), in which Martha is revealed to be the leader of the experiment. At all times during this dialogue, the viewer is very much aware that s/he is listening to a movie dialogue. In other words, suspension of disbelief breaks down here. The integrity of a believable dialogue between two people is sacrificed for a willy-nilly stuffing of information the movie makers wish to impart to the audience.<br /><br />The third problem was the casting of Adrienne Barbeau. While I honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress within her oeuvre, I feel that this part may have been too much of a stretch. The main point of her performance that didn\\'t seem to mesh was the spectrum across which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to an almost Rambo-like woman on a mission. This aspect of the script would obviously have been a stretch for any actress, and one cannot place too much blame, therefore, upon Barbeau. To the degree that she fairly competently acted her part, however, I would only call this a moderately severe problem to the film as a whole.<br /><br />Finally, the film did a wonderful job in the first half building a creep factor, most notably during its horror flashes. I feel that the film would have benefited by more of a commitment to these flashes as a mechanism for preventing a fizzling of the creep factor in the second half of the movie.<br /><br />So what\\'s my holistic grading of this piece? I\\'d give it a solid C+ to B-, depending upon how much credit you\\'re inclined to give the makers for producing this film on a limited budget. Even with two severe and two moderately severe problems, the film is premised on the solid plot of the Jungian side of Nazi mysticism. I see no problems with plot development or coherence; the dialogue, with the noted exception above, is downright brilliant in places, especially the all important keystone scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie; as mentioned, the creep factor was well crafted, if a bit fizzly in the second half; and Nicholas Brendan, who also associated produced, delivered a wonderful performance.<br /><br />All in all, this film is definitely worth the view---see it with a Nazi you love. :)',\n"," \"We saw this years ago on DVD and it has got to be the worst of the entire franchise it IS the worst!

The roaches themselves are just regular cockroaches that bite people. The Nest reminded me of a much better film called Slugs. If you liked The Nest then Slugs is a must-see as it's ten times better. Also worth noting is that Lisa Langlois who plays Elizabeth was in another 'nature run amock' type film called Deadly Eyes (aka The Rats), which is about killer rats as you may have guessed. <br /><br />If you enjoy these types of horror films then you may want to give this a watch, but you'd be far better off seeing Slugs which is far more interesting and gory.\",\n"," \"Except for an awkward scene, this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along.

I think that a lot of substance was lost due to the fact that the audience would get bored. I'd rather sit through a slow movie that is good than a slow movie that is okay.

Having three critically acclaimed films already under his belt, he recruits now veteran thespian Jeon Doyeon and her considerable (Cannes-winning) talents for the primary role of Lee Shinae. What follows is a journey through one woman's tragedy and an exploration of her coping mechanisms.<br /><br />One of the things that becomes apparent while watching Secret Sunshine is that it doesn't really care to follow any specific genre, but rather picks up genre traits when necessary to convey what it's trying to convey. The story itself follows Lee Shinae as she moves with her son to the city of Milyang (whose Sino-Corean translates to Secret Sunshine). She moves to Milyang in the aftermath of the death of her husband as it was his hometown, so the film is born from tragedy. And you think things might just get better as she opens up a piano shop and encounters a bit of a bumbling nice-guy mechanic Jongchan (played by Song Kangho). But this isn't a romantic comedy.<br /><br />As we (and Jongchan, doggedly) follow Shinae as she encounters Milyang and the fate that it has in store for her, the cracks in her armor quickly become apparent. She is a troubled woman trying to grasp onto her own strength to overcome tragedy and we watch as she finds that it's not enough. Secret Sunshine still manages to follow a mostly Aristotelian dramatic arc, but pulls back on the catharsis, which might confound some viewers, especially the ending, but the novelistic symbolism present in the name of Milyang, the discussions of sunshine and the imagery used in the film very well left me satisfied, once I started to think over the film some more.<br /><br />Ms. Jeon is rather impressive throughout, especially considering that if the role were any less well played, it would've quickly turned into a rather painful melodrama, but she captures the nuances of Shinae's attempts to deal with her losses with a layer of subtlety. Mr. Song has a much smaller role in this film than other films, but he performs adequately, appropriately giving stage to Ms. Jeon. Technically, the film is well done in a classical sense. No flashy aesthetics are employed here--the director is clearly trying to let the story tell itself. I think my only real complaint, and one that might not be able to be fixed, is that despite all the time we spend with Shinae, there is a bit of distance between Shinae and the audience (or at least, me). I think some of this stems from the nature of the work, because if total empathy were pushed, then we wouldn't be able to see the problems that Shinae has objectively. On the other hand, I never felt moved along with Shinae's plight, despite her many tears and increasingly erratic behavior.<br /><br />All the same, the film still stands quite impressive, especially in that it stimulated me to think about it, the further meanings present in it and its ruminations on tragedy, coping, self-deception, isolation and faith stuck with me well after the credits had finished running. Propelled by a strong lead performance, I honestly didn't notice its 2.25 hour runtime. And that says something.

Only this time the character is placed in a manipulative plot that seems like retreads from better crime films. It\\'s simply a window for Newman to show is talents. Other screen veterans--Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon and James Garner (who is just as natural in front of a camera as Newman)--are also on display, but are not given the screen time to display their skills. It\\'s really Newman\\'s picture and the rest of the actors are simply \"guests\". Stockard Channing is underused in the role of a police investigator and one of my favorite character actors, M. Emmet Walsh is completely wasted in the role of a...well...a corpse, I guess.

March displays just the right degree of brashness, of knowingness, and a combination of ego and a real actor\\'s almost complete lack of ego. It\\'s a miraculous piece of work.<br /><br />As Lester, Janet Gaynor is touchingly blank but the star quality she is meant to display seems conspicuously absent; (in the 1954 musical remake Judy Garland was almost too much a star). It seems inconceivable that she could eclipse March on screen (even with his drinking). If Lester is a star and possibly a great actress Gaynor keeps the secret to herself.<br /><br />The script for this version was partly written by Dorothy Parker and Alan Campbell and it shows. It\\'s an acerbic and, at times, savage movie about the movies, quite cynical for a major studio picture of it\\'s day.

The performances are breathtaking and all around the tent there are colourfully dressed performers that are there to distract, help, smile and generally make the whole tent come alive. The music - live music!! - is as good as the CD-version: perfect! I bought a DVD later but the show that was filmed had less colourful costumes. It's the atmosphere in the tent that sweeps you from your feet. A great trip for old and young, and a great film, too\",\n"," 'Why, oh, why, can Hollywood assemble such a fantastic cast, and fail the cast members so miserably with the script? Stay home and watch a \"Friends\" rerun and you\\'ll probably witness a more coherent, funnier, and truer script.<br /><br />Every actor in this cast, including Terry Bradshaw, a former football player, is fantastic.<br /><br />In fact, why can Terry Bradshaw, a former football player, act better than professional Hollywood writers can write? This script is a mess. Scenes are short and borderline incoherent, or so dumb as to be targeted at an audience too young to care about romance. What\\'s the point of putting goofy scenes, like the fake bird fake CPR scene, a scene that every seven year old in the audience will wake up for, in an alleged \"romantic\" comedy? There\\'s no romance here. None. Zero. Zip. How do you put two such beautiful, sexy, charismatic actors -- Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker -- in a movie, and yet have absolutely zero romance or heat or sexual chemistry in the movie? I mean, you\\'d really have to be trying to make a movie this erotically neutered with two such stars.<br /><br />Nothing here makes much of any sense at all. The scenes are a jumble of failed ideas quickly abandoned. The direction and editing are nil.<br /><br />A few scenes are ridiculous and childish. Matthew McConaughey is repeatedly attacked by wild animals. These scenes just never take off.<br /><br />A few scenes are painful.<br /><br />MM takes SJP on a date on someone else\\'s boat, pretending that it\\'s his. He\\'s caught, and has to run away. Is he supposed to be such a tacky character? Why is SJP supposed to fall in love with him? After MM discovers that his parents have been paying SJP to date him (this isn\\'t a spoiler; this plot device is revealed early on), he uses a particularly crude word to tell her to go away. It\\'s a believable reaction, but since everything else in the movie is so unbelievable, it\\'s just awkward and does not fit.<br /><br />Then there is the scene where one group of characters spies on another couple of characters via webcams. It\\'s meant to be heartwarming, but it\\'s just utterly unbelievable and really creepy. Whoever scripted this scene is tone deaf.<br /><br />And a few scenes are just plain bizarre, as if they came from another movie.<br /><br />This is such a shame. The actors were up for it, but the script writers and director gave them nothing to work with.',\n"," 'The Good: I liked this movie because it was the first horror movie I\\'ve seen in a long time that actually scared me.

The ways the killer killed his victims was very horrifying and disgusting. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who can not handle gore.<br /><br />Overall: A good scare, but a bad story.<br /><br />** out of *****',\n"," 'The Ghost Walks is a nifty little mystery with a great twist, snappy dialog, and best of all a pansy played to the twittery hilt by character actor Johnny Arthur which never demeans or denigrates his character. Mr. Arthur is great in his role of Homer Erskine bringing great comic relief as the secretary of the Broadway producer Herman Wood, played by another great character actor Richard Carle.<br /><br />They play off of each other superbly.<br /><br />Although the acceptable words of the time sissy and cream puff are used to describe the character of Homer, it is never mean spirited or meant as denigration, and are not spoken by the manly males of the film but by his employer, who fires and rehires him every other scene and who displays an almost exasperated affection for his devoted employee.<br /><br />There is a great scene where Homer tells his boss that he has devoted the best years of his life to him and has been everything but a mother to him.<br /><br />The mystery angle of the film is very entertaining, and the twist at the end might just leave you in stitches.<br /><br />For a low budget poverty row picture, this film has superb set decoration and great costuming.<br /><br />Director Frank Strayer ably handles his cast and this film holds together much better than some of his other low budget mystery attempts, but he had a great script to work with and some wonderful actors to carry it through.<br /><br />This film is a must see for devotees of poverty row films, old dark house mysteries (they actually managed to work in the lines \"It was a dark and stormy night)and it has the added bonus of being an early representation of a gay character in film where nothing bad happens to them in the end.<br /><br />This movie is available for download in the public domain film section of the Internet Archive at archive.org.',\n"," \"I just bought the Australian DVD release of My Brilliant Career. All I can say it was worth every penny. <br /><br />I don't need to go into the specifics of the plot. There are plenty of comments listed on IMDb already. But the peformances, by then new and upcoming actors Judy Davis and Sam Neill, are beautifully timeless!! It's everything I'd hoped for and more. It just gets better with repeated viewings.<br /><br />Made on a shoestring budget by new director Gillian Armstrong, the commentary provided by her on the recently released Australian DVD in widescreen is a real treat to listen to! You'll chuckle at the stories she tells on how cast and crew achieved what you see on screen when little or no money was left in the budget. And you'll realize how lucky and fortunate Armstrong and producer Margaret Fink were at landing Judy Davis to play Sybylla.<br /><br />My Brilliant Career is currently out-of-print in the USA. Don't know why, but currently a DVD is out in Australia and the UK only. If only the Criterion Collection would select this film for a DVD release in the USA.....\",\n"," \"Yes, this is a melodrama all right. Two boys of very different backgrounds are orphaned when a pleasure steamer catches fire and sinks in the Hudson River near New York in 1902. One boy (Mickey Rooney) is a rough and tumble type, while the other is bookish and thoughtful. They are both briefly adopted together by a man who lost his son in the same disaster. They grow up together and then go their separate ways. The rough one, 'Blackie', becomes a criminal and is played by Clarke Gable. The bookish one becomes a lawyer and criminal prosecutor, played by William Powell. Blackie has a girlfriend, played by Myrna Loy, who leaves him for Powell. What is so especially fascinating about this film is that Myrna Loy and Clark Gable do not 'click' at all, and glaze over when they look at one another, despite their best acting efforts to simulate at least some flickers of passion. But as soon as Powell and Loy are on screen together, the fizz begins, and they spark off one another like two cheeky little flints who just can't wait to make wonderful fire together. Powell seems to have been an irresistibly amusing man who was attractive to all the most glamorous gals, despite not being all that good-looking. After all, he was married to Carole Lombard and then was about to marry Jean Harlow when she died tragically. (He paid $30,000 for her funeral and took six weeks off filming with Myrna Loy in another picture because of his uncontrollable grief.) So Powell certainly knew how to interact with women of character. Myrna Loy just had the right kind of wry and whimsical manner to complement the dry humour of Powell. From the moment they first look at each other in this first film together, a unique screen magic was born, and lasted through 14 films. When I knew her very slightly as a youngster, she was 57 and rather uncommunicative, and she seemed depressed, so I never knew the 'lively Loy'. In those days videos and DVDs did not exist, so few people of my age had any idea at all of what she had been like in her films with William Powell, as we had not only never seen any of them but had no way of doing so. Nor was there any internet with a handy IMDb database where you just click your mouse and see the list of her credits. The fact is, Myrna Loy was someone one knew had been a big movie star earlier on, but one had never actually seen her on screen. She was just a name, and someone who had been in films which one's parents had seen before one was born. Well, now we can see them and so many of them are good that we can at last see Myrna Loy in perspective and appreciate just how unique and special she really was. There is a curious thing, namely that her real name was Myrna Williams and she came from Montana. Now who does that remind you of? Why, Michelle Williams of course, who comes from Montana (see my reviews of LAND OF PLENTY and INCENDIARY, where I note that this girl is an actress of genius). I wonder if they could possibly be Montana kith and kin. But I guess the world is full of people named Williams, even in Montana, which has a population of just a few thousand people and a few million cattle, doesn't it? It seems that everywhere you go, there are people named Wiliams. Perhaps it is because they are plural. Oh, back to the story. I always forget the story. Well, you can see it coming, can't you? Powell ends up prosecuting Gable for murder and demands the death sentence. That part of the story is heavily contrived, but it works very well regardless because after all it is a 1930s movie. Loy is distressed because she loves them both. You can see where the melodrama comes in, and they really lay it on, as this is not a film where subtlety is a leading quality. We get the whole thing, death row, the last minute requests for a reprieve (oh yes, Powell is Governor of New York by now and is the one who gets begged to save Blackie's life). Well the melodrama just keeps piling on top of the melodrama like that, so that the film is really a kind of melodramatic club sandwich. There is some cheese and then there's some ham (in fact there is no shortage of ham in this film) and then there's some chicken when certain persons lose their courage and then there's some lettuce to brighten and pretty things up a bit, and then there's the daily bread, it's all there. Take a bite, it's really delicious.\",\n"," \"This is the story of Linda Eastman McCartney. Her early life as a music magazine photographer. Her meeting and 30-year marriage to Beatle Paul McCartney.

Veteran actor George Segal stars as Linda's father, Lee Eastman.<br /><br />\",\n"," 'I fell in love with this film from the moment I first saw a brief clip of it on an entertainment program. At first I was drawn to the action elements (being young and somewhat immature in my dramatic tastes), but I was blown away by the romance and character interplay. I loved the composition of the scenes, the noirish lighting, and the quirky humor. This movie, along with Pedro Almodovar\\'s films, really opened my eyes to European films, particularly those with a signature style.<br /><br />The performances are great across the board. Anne Parillaud plays all facets of Nikita well, from her rebellious, drug-hazed beginning, to her growing confidence, and her near breakdown as her mission falls apart. Tcheky Karyo made a huge impression, mostly through his body language and his eyes. He says more with an expression than most actors do with dialogue. Jeanne Moraeu is a treasure, a truly beautiful woman in appearance and spirit. Jean-Hughues Anglade has the harder part, the \"normal\" guy who Nikita falls for. He is adept at comedy, but is tender in the love scenes. He carries himself well in his face-off with Bob. Finally, the actor who really stands out in memory, Jean Reno. Reno oozes charisma and talent, even in bad films. He steals the film the moment he enters.<br /><br />Luc Besson is a tremendous stylist. His films are beautiful, even when the story is a bit obtuse. He is adept at using light to portray and enhance emotion and his compositions are stunning. His main fault is that he lets style overtake story, but he gets away with it because the style is always interesting. He is a fine writer, although more care seems to go into the scripts he directs than those he has written for others.<br /><br />Finally, one can\\'t discuss the films of Besson without discussing the music of Eric Serra. Serra creates an atmosphere that is much a part of the setting as the lighting or set decoration. His compositions convey mood and emotion, adding another layer to the story. His signature bass and percussion gets your heart pumping during action sequences, while the melodies bring a softness to intimate moments. He demonstrates the proper way to use synthesizers, to transform the music, rather than make up for lack of an orchestra (or talent). Serra\\'s soundtracks were the first that I bought for instrumental music, rather than for pop songs used in the film. <br /><br />This is a film that appeals to many audiences. There is plenty of action and intrigue for thrillseekers, unique character studies, quirky humor, and above all, romance. It has spawned many imitations (Point of No Return, Black Cat, Nikita TV series) but has never been equaled. If you are a fan of film noir, action/espionage, character drama, or romance, you should see this film; then you should own this film. You\\'ll want to watch it again and again.',\n"," 'I\\'d like to point out that this movie is literally based on first hand recollections of a prostitute interviewed in Al Rose\\'s definitive book on the subject: \"Storyville\", published many years ago. Anyone familiar with with the era knows that the photographer, E.J. Bellocq, was a real person who captured on glass plates forever the images of the young prostitutes of Storyville. These photographs are hauntingly beautiful in their own right, and the young Brooke Shields--as well as the beautiful Susan Sarandon--were a masterstroke of Malle to play the parts of mother and daughter prostitutes. The recollections in the book draw upon the actual fact that the mother who related the story actually took part in the deflowering of her daughter in the \"House\" as described, and that they went on to be a \"team\", a very common and desirable commodity in that day. Not mentioned-- but inferred to those who \"read between the lines\"-- was that the pony that young Violet casually rides in the backyard of the mansion in the beginning of the movie was actually an animal used to entertain the paying customers in \"the circus\" that certain women performed in ...for the\"right price.\" Many of the photo sessions depicted in the film are loving recreations of surviving Bellocq prints. The women portraying the \"girls\" in the movie could have been working girls in \"The District\" had they lived back then. Some IMDb readers profess to be shocked by conditions in Storyville back then, but as the book recounts, it was all true, and many of the women actually did enjoy their livelyhood. It was the \"bluenoses\" to the rescue who saved them and the U.S. Navy from themselves, just as they would save the nation from \"drink\" a few years later. Although ragtime and jazz are touched on in the movie, Storyville was directly responsible for the likes of young Louis Armstrong--who ran coal from House to House--picking up the street melodies he heard and playing them on a cornet furnished to him--providentially--by the local orphanage, and for Ferdinand \"Jelly Roll\" Morton, pianist...and pimp...who played in only the best houses and claimed he invented the term \"jazz\" as applied to music after witnessing first hand all that \"jassing-around\" he saw in the bordellos of Storyville! Remarkeably, overlooked altogether is any mention of the composer of the tune \"Pretty Baby,\" Professor Tony Jackson, a key figure of the Storyville saga, who should have been the character portrayed in the film but wasn\\'t, and who was not even mentioned in the credits.<br /><br />As for Bellocq himself not much is known except that he was slightly deformed and not interested in the ladies at all sexually-- the marriage to Violet merely a modern plot device--but he professed his deep fascination and reverence for them, thankfully, in other ways: his portraits. Without them, a poignant record of their lives,and that of The District, would be lost forever. All in all, the film is a wonderful paean to Bellocq, and the women he loved in his own way. I would urge all critics of this movie to seek out a copy of \"Storyville, New Orleans\" by Al Rose, or MOMA\\'s \"E.J. Bellocq: Storyville Portraits.\" They will really open yours eyes to what Louis Malle has recreated.',\n"," 'Sorry to go against the flow but I thought this film was unrealistic, boring and way too long. I got tired of watching Gena Rowlands long arduous battle with herself and the crisis she was experiencing. Maybe the film has some cinematic value or represented an important step for the director but for pure entertainment value I wish I would have skipped it.',\n"," 'I was intrigued by the title, so during a small bout of insomnia (fueled by my curiosity...), I stayed up and watched it. I then checked my TV listings and watched it again! There is one very obvious realization that occurred to me when I saw this film- in spite of politics, traditions, culture, etc., teenagers everywhere are virtually the same. The characters of the kids from Belgrade could have been transported to, let\\'s say, somewhere in the American Midwest during the same time period, and language differences aside, would be impossible to tell apart from any of the local teens of that era. They certainly displayed the same growing pains and preoccupations, politics aside: Music, sex, movie idols, music, drinking, sports, music... As a matter of fact, much the same things that occupied my time growing up in 1970\\'s Southern California.<br /><br />This was a bittersweet story, but the joy of youth made it very enjoyable. The characters, especially the young actors, were completely believable also. I won\\'t say this was the Yugoslav \"American Graffiti\", but I will say that it fits in nicely with other 50\\'s-themed movies.',\n"," 'This was painful. I made myself watch it until the end, even though I had absolutely no interest in the plot, if there was one. My patience was not rewarded. The ending was even worse than the rest of the film. Chucky walks into the hospital with a priest and his concubine says \"I do\". How vile can one movie be?',\n"," 'Juice is a well made drama that focuses on 4 kids who just get tangled up in a bad situation. It is well directed by Ernest Dickerson and it has a lot of style. Good cast. Worth a watch.',\n"," 'I ran across this several years ago while channel surfing on a Sunday afternoon. Though it was obviously a cheesy TV movie from the 70s, the direction and score were well done enough that it grabbed my attention, and indeed I was hooked and had to watch it through to the end. I recently got the opportunity to buy a foreign DVD of this film (oops, didn\\'t notice a domestic one had finally come out a couple months prior), and was very pleased to be able to watch it again (and in its entirety).<br /><br />I don\\'t wholly understand the phenomenon, but somehow the 70s seem to have a lock on horror movies that are actually scary. The decades prior to the 70s produced some beautifully shot films and the bulk of our enduring horror icons, but are they actually scary? No, not very. Likewise in the years since the 70s we\\'ve gotten horror movies that are cooler, more exciting, have much better production values and sophisticated special effects, are more fun, funnier, have effective \"jump\" moments, and some very creative uses of gore, but again... they aren\\'t really scary! There\\'s just something about the atmosphere of the 70s horror films. The grainy film quality. The spookily dark scenes unilluminated by vast high-tech lighting rigs. The \"edge of dreamland\" muted quality of the dialogue and the weird and stridently EQ\\'d scores. The odd sense of unease and ugliness permeating everything. Everything that works to undermine most movies of the 70s, in the case of horror, works in its favor.<br /><br />Specifically, in this film, the quiet, intense shots of the devil dog staring people down is fairly unnerving. So much more effective than if they had gone the more obvious route of having the dog be growling, slavering, and overtly hostile (\"Cujo\"?). The filmmakers wisely save that for when the dog appears in its full-on supernatural form. The effects when that occurs, while unsophisticated by today\\'s standards, literally gave me chills. The bizarre, vaguely-defined, \"I\\'m not quite sure what I\\'m looking at\" look intuitively strikes me as more like how a real supernatural vision would be, rather than the hyper-real, crystal clear optical printer / digital compositor confections of latter-day horror films.<br /><br />While the human characters in this film are not as satisfyingly rendered as their nemesis or the world they inhabit, the actors all do a decent job. The pairing of the brother and sister from the \"Witch Mountain\" movies as, yes, brother and sister, is a rather cheesy bit of stunt casting, but they do fine. Yvette Mimieux always manages to be entertaining if unspectacular. Richard Crenna earns more and more empathy from the audience as the film progresses. His self-doubt as he wonders whether his family\\'s alienness is truly due to a supernatural plot or whether he\\'s merely succumbing to paranoid schizophrenia is pretty well handled, though his thought that getting a routine physical may provide an explanation for what he\\'s been experiencing is absurd in its naïveté.<br /><br />The movie\\'s The-End-Question-Mark type ending is one of the only ones I\\'ve seen that doesn\\'t feel like a cheap gimmick, and actually made me think about the choices these characters would be faced with next and what they\\'d be likely to do and how they\\'d feel about it.<br /><br />Detractors of this film may say it\\'s merely a feature-length vehicle for some neato glowing retina shots, but hey, you could say the same thing about \"Blade Runner\". :-)',\n"," 'I\\'ve never laughed and giggled so much in my life! The first half kept me in stitches; the last half made me come completely unglued! I think I giggled for 15 minutes after the tape was over.<br /><br />His timing and delivery for his stories is almost unequaled. And though he talks fast, you catch every joke. Which is probably why my \"laugh center\" was so overwhelmed; it took an extra 15 minutes to laugh at everything.<br /><br />',\n"," \"It's great how this movie pulls you along. I had honest laughs. Don't care that it's low budget cause the thing works for me. To be honest my wife didn't really go for it in the same way but she prefers a different type of film. She did admit though that it was very creative and well put together and probably all on a shoe string. These characters who's lives are strange and troubled give me something to relate to in my own world. Just keep going and be who you are. Dreams are what you make of them. In watching this movie a second and third time I realized that there are some hidden moments that passed by me on the first time through. What can I say, I like my fun with some complexity. Anyway liked it. Hope to see more.\",\n"," 'My wife wanted to rent this and watch it. It really is cute in some places, but there\\'s nothing here that\\'s any better than the Planet Earth episode on polar bears. In fact, the opening sequence of the bears emerging from their den is remarkably similar...<br /><br />The storyline is contrived and the references to changing climate blatantly obvious.<br /><br />It truly is sad that these magnificent animals die, but that\\'s the essence of the natural world, right? Some animals prey on others, climate changes in natural cycles. Polar bears survived the last stint of global warming just fine. The ice sheets were so small 1000 years ago that crops could be grown in Greenland. Wine grapes were grown in England. Where were the polar bears then? This movie was not nearly as good as \"March of the Penguins\". I came away from that movie inspired. I came away from this one wanting to gag.',\n"," 'This a Casper the Friendly Ghost short from my childhood, and I re-watch it on YouTube (Thank GOD! for You Tube); after that I love this short, and it is one of my favorite Casper shorts.<br /><br />I love how the short starts off spooky with Frank Gallop\\'s haunting narration; until we get to see Casper sitting by his tombstone in the cemetery, reading. While every ghost rose from the graves to \"boo\" people, Casper decides to leave in search for a friend. But in trying to make a friend, anyone who sees Casper runs away. Poor Casper sat on a log and weep; until a little fox cub comes up an nuzzles him. Casper and the little fox quickly bond and he quickly names the cub Ferdie and considers him to be his very best friend. <br /><br />Casper and Ferdie\\'s relationship is put in tremendous jeopardy however when Casper is not keeping a close eye on Ferdie while they are playing a game of Hide and Seek. While Ferdie is hiding a hunter and two of his hunting dogs come and try to kill little Ferdie and Ferdie is running as fast as possible until he is out of breath and starts panting. While the hunter is firing gunshots towards Ferdie Casper notices they are trying to kill him and flies in the hunter\\'s direction and pleads that the hunter leaves Ferdie alone. And the hunter and dogs are terrified of Casper. Casper yells to Ferdie that the hunter and the dogs are gone and that everything is fine. But Casper sees Ferdie\\'s body is not moving and asks if he is OK. When Casper sees Ferdie has died he starts mourning in pain because he lost \"the only friend he ever had in his whole life.\" Casper returns back to the cemetery where he has buried Ferdie and has made a gravestone for him next to Casper\\'s gravestone. Casper continues mourning in pain until he sees that Ferdie has resurrected as a ghost himself. Ferdie starts licking Casper on his cheek. Casper screams for joy because he has been reunited with Ferdie.<br /><br />Overall, it is a really good short; though surprisingly disturbing, showing death in a family-oriented cartoon.',\n"," \"Brian Yuzna is often frowned upon as a director for his trashy gore-fests, but the truth is that his films actually aren't bad at all. The Re-Animator sequels aren't as great as the original, but are still worthy as far as horror sequels are concerned. Return of the Living Dead 3 is the best of the series; and Society isn't a world away from being a surrealist horror masterpiece. This thriller certainly isn't a masterpiece; but it shows Yuzna's eye for horror excellently, and the plot moves in a way that is always thrilling and engaging. I'm really surprised that a horror movie about dentistry didn't turn up until 1996, as going to the dentist is almost a primal fear - it's running away from a tiger for the modern world. Dentistry doesn't frighten me, but surprisingly; I would appear to be in the minority. The plot follows perfectionist dentist Dr Feinstone. He has a nice house, a successful career and a beautiful wife - pretty much everything most people want. However, his life takes a turn for the worse when he discovers his wife's affair with the pool cleaner. And his life isn't the only one; as it's his patients who feel the full brunt of his anger...<br /><br />When it comes to scaring the audience, this movie really makes itself. However, credit has to go to the director for extracting the full quota of scares from the central theme. The fact that he does a good job is summed up by the fact that I'm not squeamish about going to the dentist - yet one particular scene actually made me cover my eyes! The film follows the standard man going insane plot outline, only with The Dentist you always get the impression that there's more to the film than what we're seeing. It isn't very often that a gore film can impress on a substance level - and while this won't be winning any awards, the parody on the upper class is nicely tied into the plot. The acting, while B-class, is actually quite impressive; with Corbin Bernsen taking the lead role and doing a good job of convincing the audience that he really is a man on the edge. I should thank Brian Yuzna for casting Ken Foree in the movie. The Dawn of the Dead star doesn't get enough work, and I really love seeing him in films. The rest of the cast doesn't massively impress, but all do their jobs well enough. Overall, The Dentist offers a refreshing change for nineties slasher movies. The gore scenes are sure to please horror fans, and I don't hesitate to recommend this film.\",\n"," 'I keep waiting for Peter Fonda to start acting. For someone who comes from such a talented family, it\\'s a mystery to me why Peter Fonda can only play Peter Fonda trying to play someone else. And, that\\'s the good news in this disappointing dog of an adaptation of The Tempest. A string of loosely connected ideas that only suggest a relationship with the Bard\\'s great play is what we\\'re served. The setting is the Civil War and Prospero\\'s (here Guideon\\'s) evil brother looks like an 1890\\'s melodrama villain, complete with Snidely Whiplash moustache. I kept waiting for him to go \"Uh ha hah!\" which would have been a high point in this dreary presentation. None of the supporting cast was memoriable and Peter Fonda\\'s lack of expression and wooden body movements made the lackadaisical story drag on and on. <br /><br />The Tempest is the Bard\\'s statement about the rage of man\\'s unjust treatment of man. The only believable character was the Gator man, the Caliban counterpart. The transferrence to the swamp had possibilities but the Civil War setting just didn\\'t make it. All in all, a very disappointing production. I saw it on video and would advise, if you want a Willy Shakespeare fix, save your money on this one. Rent something else, like Branagh\\'s Much Ado about Nothing, or Kevin Kline in Midsummer\\'s Night Dream.',\n"," \"Kenneth Branagh shows off his excellent skill in both acting and writing in this deep and thought provoking interpretation of Shakespeare's most classic and well-written tragedy. Kenneth plays the role of Hamlet with such a distinct emotion that provokes tears. Kate Winslet's performance is also of great note.\",\n"," 'Jamie Foxx was the epitome of Ray Charles. After a few moments you stop seeing a film and see a biography played by the great man himself. Ray Charles was truly a genius of music and the movie excellently depicted that. No one has ever or will ever write, play, or record music like this musical giant. When he passed the flesh, the world lost one of it\\'s greatest American heroes. As far as the movie, the fact that Jamie Foxx received a classical music scholarship to college and could play like Ray was an asset to the director. What could be better than that? You don\\'t have to have a \"double\" play piano and then try to split the screen from someone else\\'s hands to Jamie\\'s face. It worked beautifully. I loved the fact that it also picked up how difficult Ray was. He wasn\\'t always a nice man. You didn\\'t also root for him. He was a drug addict, a womanizer, and sometimes just plain hard-headed. But I guess that\\'s what made him genius so I can\\'t fault him for that. I pick Jamie for Best Actor!',\n"," 'A historical note: Although tons of pictures of Vikings with horned helmets have been produced over the years, this is actually a myth. They never, to our knowledge, wore such helmets. And, if you think about it, this makes sense, as the horns would make such a helmet unwieldy and difficult to wear. Plus, you might get stuck going through doorways! This traditional view of Vikings is more the Wagnerian view of the people. In fact, the wonderful movie \"The Vikings\" is so wonderful, in part, because it gets this point correct. Also, while this might disappoint you, most historians don\\'t believe King Arthur ever lived or if he did, the stories about him are all false. The stories you read about him were often written as much as 1000-1300 years after he was to have lived and vary tremendously--and they are essentially myths. Sorry to spoil this for you, but I was a history teacher--and I love debunking myths.<br /><br />The film begins with Valiant (Robert Wagner) being sent by his daddy the king (Donald Crisp) to the court of King Arthur to become a knight. Crisp\\'s friend, hidden under all that makeup and hair, is Victor McLaglen, by the way. It seems that Crisp has had his kingdom stolen from him and why he would then choose to send his son away is a bit of a mystery. What also is a mystery is why a Viking would go to the UK and serve Arthur. Oh well, it\\'s no worse than a film I saw years ago where a Saracen (who were from the Middle East) was also in Arthur\\'s court! At least Scandinavia is kind of near Britain! On his way there, he stumbles upon a Viking making a dirty deal with a Brit--and accidentally stumbles into the midst of the traitors. He manages to escape(!) but is now a man pursued by many who wish to bash in his skull! In addition to avoid getting killed, much of the film concerns Valiant\\'s new career as a squire. While he hates to have such a lowly job, such is the way to career advancement in the knighthood game. Oh, and by the way, knights were NOT the noble dudes you see in the film. Mostly, they were used to beat up the peasants for their lords and fight various wars. They were an incredibly violent and non-chivalrous group and I\\'d love to see a film portray them like they really were--often, a bunch of raping, murdering scalawags. Now THAT would make for an interesting film! So, as you can tell, I hate this film for its many, many inaccuracies. However, I can enjoy such a film on purely an entertainment level. So is it entertaining and worth seeing? Well at least on a aesthetic level, it\\'s a nice film. It has the wonderful touches that you\\'d expect from an A-picture from Twentieth-Century Fox. Great music, lovely period costumes, wonderful locations and nifty castles--it sure looked wonderful (though the castles used were all built much too late for the time period in the film--gosh, that history teacher in me is rearing up its ugly head again).<br /><br />As for the writing, dialog and acting, it\\'s not a film that impresses. Much of the dialog seems strangely anachronistic and dull. Some is even rather dumb (such as when Janet Leigh confronts Valiant at the 50 minute mark). The characters all seem a bit flat and dull. The actors, though often accomplished, are not at their best here. Sterling Hayden, a wonderful actor, just seems out of place as does James Mason. The biggest problem, however, is Robert Wagner. In this period in the 1950s he was very much an up and coming actor--having starred in quite a few plum roles. However, Hollywood often didn\\'t seem to know how to use this handsome man--putting him in films that simply didn\\'t seem to fit him. Here, he plays a Viking and in \"Broken Lance\" (also 1954), they cast him as a macho cattle rancher!! I mean no disrespect, but he was not the action hero sort of guy. He would have been better in romances or such films as \"A Kiss Before Dying\"--where he very effectively played a guy who romanced and then murdered women. You can\\'t blame Wagner for these roles--he was young and the studios paid well...and they were starring roles. Too bad he just wasn\\'t right for them--and his accent and manner seemed to have NOTHING to do with Vikings. I would have much preferred to see some rugged ruffian in the role instead (such as Ernest Borgnine or Victor Mature).<br /><br />As far as action goes, for an adventure film it is strangely static and filled with dialog. I would have loved a good castle siege or sacking here and there throughout the film...and I kept waiting and waiting and it only came too late--after I was pretty bored with the film. Sure, there were a few nice attempted murders here and there (cool) but not enough to make the film seem \"actiony\"--instead, it was much too much like a stuffy costume drama much of the time.<br /><br />Now if I wanted to watch a rousing and completely historically inaccurate film, there are a lot of dandy ones out there. \"Ivanhoe\" and \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" are fantastic costume dramas and are first-class entertainment. And, if you are some sort of weirdo and want to actually see something with more realism and accuracy (but with tons of really, really cool action), try \"The Vikings\"--a rousing and wonderful bit of entertainment that actually touches on some of the themes seen in \"Prince Valiant\". It isn\\'t that this film is terrible (it isn\\'t), but there just are a lot better and more entertaining films out there to see first. Heck, now that I think of it, \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" would definitely be my choice as the best Arthurian film out there!',\n"," \"Terrible film with Frank Sinatra as Tony Rome.

When a local club owner gets killed, the blame falls on Rome and there becomes an interesting chase scene. That's how bad this picture is if you have to depend on a chase scene to supply the action.<br /><br />Raquel Welch plays the beauty up to her neck in intrigue.

There\\'s always going to be that inevitable time when a person just runs out of ideas, and this film seems to be that moment for Abbott & Costello. The whole of this film seems to me, just a bunch of their old routines and gags run together in order to fill up the running time of a feature film. This is why it\\'s so very difficult, even for veterans like A&C, to keep a film moving, especially at feature length. Difficult for the writers first of all, to keep a story together and include comedic bits without it all seeming to be just a patch quilt of non-related ideas. They all went through this at one time or another, i.e. Chaplin, Keaton, Laurel & Hardy, etc. That isn\\'t to say that this is a totally bad film, just parts of it. The giant \"kong like\" ape that\\'s being searched for, for instance, is just too much. Good comedy exaggerates the realistic but never should it traverse into the \"Twilight Zone\" just for effect. Something that\\'s interesting about this film is that there appears a current \"Stooge\" with a future \"stooge\", namely Shemp Howard and Joe Besser. Joe Besser was not, in my opinion \"stooge material\" but here with A&C and Shemp, he\\'s an actual riot. Ironic. This is certainly not one of the better A&C films but worth watching, maybe as a double feature with \"A&C Meet Frankenstein\".',\n"," '... why watch a TV drama (billed as a comedy) in which none of the characters are likable or even interesting people ? I can sort of see what the writer David Renwick was trying to achieve: the misdirections and bad-taste surprises that he put into \"One foot in the grave\", etc. I admit that the script made a bit more of an effort than most on British TV at the moment. But really ... who cares about these people ? They are cold bores.<br /><br />Another poster mentioned the scene in which the woman sits down to watch a video of herself and her deceased ex-boyfriend shagging. That was the moment when I switched OFF this programme, never to return.<br /><br />P.S. It\\'s interesting to note that the posters who didn\\'t like this series are all British, whereas those who praise it are mostly in other countries. This reflects the fact that when the BBC broadcast this series it was ignored by viewers and sank like a stone.<br /><br />P.P.S. Good news for those who liked it !

Please don\\'t ruin this great piece by your simple mindedness. The reasons are far more complex than the single thing you mentioned. Please read the book as is it a great source of information.

The script is sub-par, but it does succeed in being mildly humorous in spots, whether it means to be or not. The acting is mostly over-the-top, but that is true for many lower-budget movies.<br /><br />The aspect of this movie that I really hated, though, was that 90-95% of it is shot on film, but in random places, there will be 5-10 seconds where the footage is shot on video. You can tell because there is less contrast, the colors are less vivid, and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second instead of film's 24 frames per second. I'm not sure if maybe these scenes had to be shot later and at that time they didn't have the money to shoot on film (I assume this is why, anyway), but it is disorienting and really makes the film look shoddier than it had to look.<br /><br />Anyway, I've definitely seen worse movies, but I definitely wouldn't say that I enjoyed this movie and I can't recommend that anyone see it.\",\n"," '\"Stargate SG-1\" follows the intergalactic explorations of a team named SG-1 through a device called the Stargate and all the surprises awaiting on the other side of the wormhole.<br /><br />Having seen this series sporadically for it\\'s first few seasons when it first came out, I didn\\'t know how good this series would really be, 10 years after I had last seen an episode. My old impression was that the series was great, but my impression was far from the truth. \"Stargate SG-1\" is more than just a simple sci-fi series, it is one of the most well made, interesting, long running, exciting sci-fi ever produced. And why? Because it runs on an amazing premise.<br /><br />This series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and I think it is a very good example that television, as a medium, with a suitable premise, is able to provide something that doesn\\'t work on the time restriction of film. The sense of familiarity created by a long running series, watching the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief, and it\\'s all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show.<br /><br />\"Stargate SG-1\" kept offering great adventures throughout the 10 years, but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show: <br /><br />- The first few seasons, perhaps up to the 4th/5th, focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations, keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending Goaul\\'d threat. <br /><br />- From the 5th to the 7th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the Goaul\\'d and preventing attacks on Earth. After this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg-1 in a place of Goaul\\'d/replicator/ori conflicts<br /><br />- The 8th season is probably the most mixed one. It has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned, but the last episodes feature some great replicator moments. <br /><br />- The 9th and 10th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no Jack O\\'Neil. They are both good continuations, although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a little weak, because they seem to be about little more than SG-1 and human/Jaffa losing battle after battle to the Ori.<br /><br />Basically, after season 7, exploration was pushed to the background, which in many ways was a shame, because of the potential and mystery each planet(episode) presented; on the other hand, it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were.<br /><br />Even tough I believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest, the feeling I have is that it could go on; the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer. A last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very doable and would have been most welcome, but ultimately things are as they are.<br /><br />In the end, because of the fact that I enjoyed everything, it\\'s a little hard to find that it ends. The big picture, however, the one drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of 10 years, is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew, those outstanding actors and the characters the we will always remember as a collective by the name of SG-1.',\n"," 'My family (two 40-somethings, an 8 year old and my 71 yr old mother) saw this at a sneak preview on April 29th.

Luke Wilson was a hoot (pun intended) to watch as was Tim Blake Nelson. And seeing Neil Flynn play something other than \"the mean janitor from Scrubs\" was nice. The kids in movie did well and I\\'m sure they will all appeal to a certain demographic on the heartthrob level. The visuals were just lovely and the Jimmy Buffet music added to the \"Florida feel\".

He is given the sword of omens and a cat claw and they start a new life on a planet filled with many perils including mutant men, pirates, and the evil creature Mummra. The cartoon was a pretty action packed, the dialog at times was corny and as the show progressed it got weaker, but that is really a lot of cartoon shows at the time. I have to admit, of all the cartoons there were this was probably the easiest one to collect all the toys for as they really did not add to many characters to the show as it went along. You basically had Liono, Panthro, Cheetara, the tiger dude (can't remember his name), Snarf and the two kid ones. The villains consisted of about three mutants, Mummra and a group of pirates that really did not have all that many episodes. There were another set of super berserker warriors and two or three more Thundercats introduced in later episodes, but I do not ever recall seeing them as toys. So all in all a good show, with the one story arc of Liono having to past these tests facing the other Thundercats as one of the highlight multiple part stories.\",\n"," \"All the bare chested women in the world couldn't keep me from hitting the stop button about a third of the way through this awful rubbish.

It isn\\'t a movie that stayed with me in any way - I\\'ve always been a fan of Halloween / Michael Meyers. That said, I think I know what makes a good horror film, and I know that none of those things are in this film.<br /><br />My first complaint lies in the structure of the story. The first thirty minutes or so of prologue lend nothing but confusion as to where the story is going. When we find out after the first group of murders who has been kept alive and how they are connected to the second story line (Clay\\'s search for his sister), I had spent so much time being repulsed by the group of friends that I really had no emotional stake (re: I couldn\\'t even remember the character\\'s name) in whether the girl lived or died. <br /><br />My second complaint lies with I expect that there will be the obtuse sex, drinking, and drugs in any \"campy\" horror film like this, but these first 30 minutes were so packed with inane boobs and weed shots that I was ready to consider this a comedy, not a horror film. I\\'m not looking for social commentary when I see a slasher film, but all of the references to marijuana seem like they\\'re being made by people who have never even come in contact with it. It\\'s almost like when you\\'re in High School, bragging about how high you got, and the guy you\\'re talking to lies so that he doesn\\'t feel stupid for not partaking in substances like that: \"Man, I got SOOOOoooo freaking high last night. What\\'d you do at the party?\" \"Oh, uhm, I smoked several weed cigarettes and drank a couple brewskis, then passed out.\" Apparently, this guy wrote a screenplay for a Friday the 13th \"remake\".<br /><br />Lastly, although I could probably keep complaining about this film, Jason is absolutely NOT SCARY in the first half of this movie. By the time we\\'re midway through the second story line (I contend that this movie should have been called: \"Friday the 13th: A Bunch of Douche Bags Go Camping, and Jason Voorhees Is Somewhat Involved\") there have been so many crappy people on-screen, and they have been killed by Jason in typical Jason style, he just isn\\'t that scary anymore. We know he\\'s there, waiting for the topless girl with fake boobs to swim ashore so he can decapitate her. WE KNOW. This film is neither atmospheric, nor does it even attempt to build tension. It is simply a terrible movie.<br /><br />Other grievances: The pot-dealing redneck, who is only introduced so that he can be killed and Jason can find his hockey mask (a full HOUR into the film), is the single most disgusting character I\\'ve ever seen on-screen. This is not a compliment: just before his \"untimely\" demise, he talks to a mannequin, and asks the mannequin if she \"remembers that night, when (she) took (his) virginity\". I would rather be decapitated by Jason than ever hear those words spoken in a film again.<br /><br />Why is it that every Michael Bay production or direction has to include the blue halo / lens flare around electric lights? I noticed this early on, but at one point later in the film, as a flashlight goes across the screen, there is actually a sound effect applied when the lens flare hits the audience. WHY? How much money did you spend on that? How much time was spent adding that tiny \"swoosh\" into the soundtrack?

Behemoth fell into the second category, a genre started with the excellent Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, and elaborated upon with Godzilla and Them! However, by the time Behemoth rolled before the cameras, the concept of atomically created monsters had already worn thin. Nevertheless, this is one of the better films of its type; a real gem made on a budget so tiny that it wouldn't even cover the cost of a current feature's end credit listings!<br /><br />Credit for the film's cult reputation must go to the men behind the Behemoth. Although Jack Rabin, Irving Block and Louis DeWitt are first billed in the effects credits, it was King Kong's Willis O'Brien and his assistant Pete Peterson, that brought the Behemoth to life. Their Paleosaurus- though in some ways reminiscent of the Beast From 20,000 Fathoms-is nonetheless a unique creation, with its long neck and legs giving it a stature that makes it tower over most of its surroundings. The skin of the model is finely detailed, with hundreds of minute scales, while the back has a single row of serrated plates, a very realistic model in spite of the movie's low-budget pedigree. The animation, mostly created by Peterson while in a wheelchair due to his advanced multiple sclerosis, is superb; Peterson had learned well from master craftsman O'Brien, and ensured the dinosaur's movements would seem natural, even giving it something of a personality.<br /><br />Despite Peterson and O'Brien's expertise, the film does have some technical flaws (the stiff, live-action prop head that rams the ferryboat is regrettable) but effective stop-motion scenes counterbalance these missteps. In an atmospheric night scene reminiscent of Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, the Behemoth, in silhouette, wanders into some power lines, reacting first with shock, then anger as it attacks the high-tension towers. In the first stop-motion scene of the monster rising from the Thames, the Behemoth strides towards the camera, attacks some dockside cranes, and continues forward, eventually passing over the camera- a trademark of O'Brien's visual style. Sadly, this was also the last film that highlighted his stop-motion work. This makes the movie significant for historians, and a must for buffs.<br /><br />Another aspect of Behemoth that makes it compare favorably to most of its contemporaries at the time was the direction by Eugene Lourie, and the elegant, understated performances. Lourie (who had previously directed Beast From 20,000 Fathoms) attempted to repeat that success with Behemoth, this time not only directing, but screenwriting as well. However, budgetary restrictions forced Lourie to keep the monster off-screen for a longer time. Instead of shots of the monster actually attacking ships and structures (as Ray Harryhausen had done in Beast) Lourie substituted after-the-fact sequences (such as a beached steamship). Not until the creature has actually entered London is the viewer allowed a good look at it. However, it's to Lourie's credit that he eschewed the non-essential romantic subplot typical of most 50's B-movies. As the film was an Anglo-American production, he made the story into an English mystery of sorts, similar to the Dr. Quartermass films. We know from the start that something radioactive is killing fish and men off the coast of England, but it's up to the lead characters to solve the riddle of the source of the radioactivity.<br /><br />In the opening of the film, an American biologist, Steven Karnes (played by Gene Evans) is lecturing a group of scientists about the dangers of not only nuclear weapons testing, but the disposal of radioactive wastes- a warning still timely 45 years later! Evans plays his role straight and understated- he's the hero, yet doesn't let his character exceed what would be expected of a scientist investigating an unusual phenomenon. Likewise, his British counterpart, Prof. Bickford (Andre Morrell) also plays low-key. Evans even allows Karnes to undergo a subtle change in his behavior. In the beginning of the movie, Karnes's blunt, direct (American) attitude puts off the reserved Bickford and other English authorities. Eventually, Karnes begins to adopt a more diplomatic manner, ultimately suggesting rather than demanding that a torpedo be the ideal means of destroying the Behemoth. By treating the film as a detective thriller, Lourie managed to keep it moving, involving the cast in various bits of business that hold the audience even when the animal does not appear. Once the Behemoth surfaces, however, the film exchanges mystery for spectacle, even if on a smaller scale than Beast or Gorgo, Lourie's 3rd (and most spectacular) monster on the loose epic.<br /><br />The only real letdown (other than the prop head) is the demise of the creature. Unlike Beast, with its spectacular finale- as the monster reared up before a burning roller coaster and finally expired- (a nice Harryhausen touch) the Behemoth is simply struck and blown up by the torpedo. Instead of a stop-motion shot of the monster dead or mortally wounded, the unrealistic prop head briefly rises for a final time before plunging into the depths of an obvious studio tank. O'Brien and Peterson probably didn't have time to film the creature's destruction in a more dramatic fashion, although they were certainly capable of wringing pathos out of their creations. The musical score, by Edwin Ashley, while not as bold as David Buttloph's for Beast, still provides both low key tension during non-monster sequences and dramatic enhancement during the monster's rampage. Ashley's work here was likely influenced by passages from Stravinsky's Rite of Spring; it has a primitive, visceral power. Those who like their dinosaur thrills high tech (CGI) may find Behemoth dated, but for those who admire old-fashioned craftsmanship, and for fans of this unique genre, I recommend taking a look at this minor classic.\",\n"," \"Whoops I forgot my 3D glasses to experience those mind-popping images (where we are informed when to put them on or take them off), but I doubt that gimmick would have saved this already below-average, if bizarre supernatural/slasher tale from Hong Kong. It looks like it had a bit money behind it, but it feels second-rate when compared to others of its field and that ending is a complete wimp out. <br /><br />At least it has going for it some stylish visual brushes by Wai-keung Lau's frenetic direction and an imposingly eerie setting (an abandoned theme park, which has some freaky looking clown dolls on a hanging tree) with some sensational art direction (like the opening entrance of the clown face). Too bad that it's senselessly penned with an messy same-old, same old structure (even though the concept showed more promise than your copy-and-paste 'Ringu' clone) of cheap jolts, typical thrills (that steals its thunder from other films) and lazily constructed characters. Even throughout it demonstrates some unwelcoming camp qualities, where the witless script and self-knowing humour just don't come off. It irritated, but not as much as the performances do. Bobo Chan in the lead role never convinces and her screaming/crying gave me a splitting headache.<br /><br />Yen along with her friends are looking for her missing brother, despite the warning from her medium mother that he's dead. It leads them to an amusement park, which closed down over a decade ago after a horrible accident involving the death of a young girl. Instead of finding her brother they come across restless spirits who pick them off one by one.<br /><br />The computer effects are well-done and never distracting, as there's one memorable decapitation sequence that's brilliantly executed and there's a little bit of blood 'n'gore in the traditional style. Sound effects hold an atmospheric grip, but those constant whooshing noises and whispering voices could've been toned down. The music score wasn't all that effective, even with some jaded cues.<br /><br />Pretty much like a foreseeable, underwhelming haunted house theme park ride.\",\n"," \"They don't make them like these anymore - and I'm really glad they don't.

The composition and editing and design are pure '70s chop-socky, except without any real kung fu. Very amateurish production; plot that promises much and goes nowhere. An attempted Chinese-Canandian production that doesn't really know what it wants to accomplish. Stereotypical performances of stereotypical characters.

In a multi-cultural, inner-city high school, the film provided many subjects for discussion (in French in class, but I know a lot of discussion went on in English after class). The most obvious is the relationship between Protée and Aimée compared to the one between Protée and France.<br /><br />I always mentioned that I felt this film had one of the \"sexiest\" scenes I had ever seen in a movie. One year, a 17-year-old African-American shouted, \"Yes!\" when he figured out the scene: the one where Protée is helping Aimée lace up her evening dress, all the while both are examining the reflection of the other in the mirror. Directors use the \"mirror technique\" when then want to focus on the inner conflict on the part of one or more character in a scene: this is a perfect example of the technique, and it is \"sexy\".<br /><br />Most students had trouble understanding the end of the film.

Eight years and no hits later, the band commit the ultimate act of patheticness by subjecting themselves to auditioning a bunch of talentless wannabes to be the new lead singer of a band that is 20 years past its prime. So they trot all of these awful singers (I thought American Idol had its share of doozies) who do atrocious renditions of just about every classic (and predictable) rock song imaginable.

Michael Hutchence, if he had any shred of dignity when alive, has to be rolling over in his grave. Not that INXS were ever a great band, but I had no idea they were this pathetic. If INXS are at all representative of what rock and roll has become, this show would be the final proof that rock and roll is once and for all, dead.',\n"," 'Wildcat is a typical B-movie of the 40\\'s. The plot is straight forward and largely predictable. For those not familiar with the term, wildcat refers to someone taking the risk of drilling for oil in unproven areas.<br /><br />While there are no major stars here, there are some recognizable faces. Richard Arlen made a career of B-movies and plays the lead here as an endearing hustler. His main antagonist is Buster Crabbe of Flash Gordon fame. William Frawley (Fred Mertz of I Love Lucy) plays an unscrupulous card shark, that eventually shows some heart. Toss in character actor Arthur Hunnicutt, who is best known as a crotchety old-timer from westerns and 50\\'s TV. Overall, a decent cast that does a fine, if unspectacular job of delivering the goods.<br /><br />The dialogue is snappy in parts, but also lame in places. There are enough conflicts and action sequences to keep the story moving without bogging down. The characters cover a wide range. There is the flawed hero lead, the conniving femme fatale, a naive youth, a cold-hearted antagonist and loyal associates.<br /><br />While this movie is mildly entertaining, there is nothing spectacular here.

It has been screened recently (Sept. 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as many others. It is a quite remarkable film. The filmmakers literally stumbled into the story, being there to make a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves squarely in the middle of events as the coup unfolded. They had unprecedented access to events and people and, for the most part, let the story unfold as it happens. They, of course, have their own ideological perspective (which they make evident) but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus attention on the events, the people, and the background and history leading up to the coup. As a film, it is not ground-breaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and that is, I think, the way it should be. What we get to see what 'embedded' journalism should really be. What we get to see is a remarkable account of a country struggling to attain democracy... a charismatic leader (Chavez) who actually cares for his people... a story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate/military/media interests combine to lead a coup of a democratically elected leader... and unprecedented access to a historical event as it unfolds.<br /><br />\",\n"," \"I haven't been a fan of Sean Penn's since Fast Times at Ridgemont High.

I won't go into the story line since that's been reviewed a lot by others. The story is sort of a cliché'd one and has been done before, though not as well. The story isn't this film's strength anyway - it's the acting. Rarely have I seen a film with this much powerful acting. Penn's performance as Sam is brilliant! He must have studied autistic/mentally challenged people to pull this performance off. I also want to mention how good Michele Pfeiffer was in this. Her character starts out as a hard-hearted witch and ends up being very human, thanks to her exposure to Sam. The change in her is gradual, subtle and fun to watch. Sams friends, very well played by Brad Silverman, Joseph Rosenberg, Stanley DeSantis and Doug Hutchinson are very important support characters. Laura Dern gives a stellar performance as Randy. Dakota Fanning as Lucy very nearly steals the show. This little actress has quite a career ahead of her, I hope! This film is delicately balanced, and has a good bit of humor interspersed with parts that will have even the most insensitive of you reaching for a tissue.

In it we see him trying to perfect the large-scale action scene that would be necessary in his full-length features, packing in all the elements that had made his previous action shorts successful.<br /><br />Griffith uses the western format \\x96 already the ideal backdrop for pure, straight-ahead action set pieces \\x96 as the setting for his first epic battle. Like many westerns of the 1910s, the starting point is a character from the east heading out west \\x96 a device which perhaps helped ease the audience into the wilderness, and here those easterners are a pair of children, which was important for the type of picture this develops into. For Griffith, you couldn\\'t have action without a sense of vulnerability and here he crams it in, with the kids from back east, Lillian Gish as the distraught mother of \"the only baby in town\" and even some puppies that are at risk of ending up on the Indians\\' menu.<br /><br />All this paves the way for an exceedingly complex and layered action sequence, blending the trapped heroine scenario and the ride-to-the-rescue with the battles that Griffith had been depicting since his earliest Civil War pictures in 1909. There is a phenomenal amount going on here, and Griffith does very well at maintaining the exhilarating pace throughout and keeping everything coherent and logical. However, juggling x amount of elements in an action sequence does not necessarily make it that many times more exciting, no matter how skilfully they are balanced, and Griffith did create better tension-soaked finales before and after this one.<br /><br />But even a Griffith picture so heavily focused on action would not be without its drama, characterisation and atmospherics. In The Battle at Elderbrush Gulch, the emotional set-up is dealt with briefly but economically. First, we have the scene in which the waifs leave their home. The cart they travel on heads away from the camera, making use of depth and distance to express their moving away from safety and civilization. An equally effective scene is the one in which we are introduced to the young family of Gish, Bobby Harron and their baby. The people of the town coo over the precious tot, then saunter off screen, revealing that two Indians were watching them from the background, adding a sinister little note of danger.<br /><br />Of course, many viewers today have pointed out The Battle at Elderbrush Gulch\\'s offensive portrayal of Native Americans (in contrast with the more sympathetic Red Man\\'s View), but perhaps all is not what it seems. First of all, take a look at the Indian Chief\\'s son\\'s waistcoat \\x96 it\\'s black and covered in shiny white dots. It looks to me like a pearly king\\'s jacket, perhaps modified slightly for the warmer climate. Now have a look at the \"war dance\" they perform later on \\x96 it has a certain \"knees-up Mother Brown\" air to it. These aren\\'t Indians, they\\'re cockneys!

If you didn't see it, I recommend you to avoid seeing. The book is really good, I recommend you read it instead of watching this.\",\n"," \"For the record, this film is intriguing but its hardly original. Back in 1998 a movie starring Talia Shire called The Landlady had almost the exact same plot but with younger characters.<br /><br />The story is Amanda Lear has had a bad life, abusive father, horny doctor, mental homes, etc. She's finally released from the happy home under the guidance of her perverted doctor...who she anally abuses and kills the poor guy. (now THAT was original) The doctor had financed a mansion for her before she killed him and buried the sucker in the backyard. After moving in she falls in love with a stud named Richard, who just happens to be married to a blues singer. If you've seen The Landlady you know the rest, she kills or tries to kill anyone that gets in between her and Richard (including a roadie).<br /><br />Much of the idea's came from the previous movie, same idiot sidekick that sticks his nose in, same spying on the guy with a bowl of popcorn, same flying a bodypress. It did have some original material, the beer bottle thing was brutal. The highlight of the movie was Amanda's beautiful breasts in the hot-top scene.

It was called power rangers. I remember that little kids would go around hitting each other and then the shirts and the stuff from the show was banned in many school districts all over the country because this show taught kids how to fight each other in solving their differences.<br /><br />I never really thought of this as a show, especially when better shows like The Tick were playing on Fox Kids. Most older teens always looked at power rangers in a ridiculous and scornful manner, and it's not hard to wonder why. The footage is ridiculous at best. The colored rangers costumes look like stuff you would work out in and the dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense. Then you get into the acting, and of course those really laughable haircuts. All the guys run around with earrings on, half of them are wearing 90's mullets, and they always wear the same clothes everyday, and then change into leotard wearing power rangers.<br /><br />The toys are especially ridiculous as well, and was the joke of many late night talk show hosts. And of course two of the worst movies ever made, and I do mean two of the worst movies ever made were based on this show with nearly every critic trashing both the films, and the shows it was based on.<br /><br />Power rangers is nothing more than a bad television commericial for especially bad toy merchandising.

Did the makers of this film really think that Jason fans would care to see a Jason movie without Jason really being in it? Plus the opening credits in the film last for about 15 minutes! Irritating! Also, the soundtrack sounds like it came from a rejected Disney film. I would strongly recommend not watching this movie at all as it contains no memorable lines, scenes, or characters.

Watching the film again, yesterday, I\\'ve been stunned by its quality, its objectivity and its strength. It\\'s much more than a \"concert movie\" (especially compared to the current ones, with their feverish cranes and cameramen moves). Michael Wadleigh and his crew really captured the spirit of the event, as it became obvious it was creating itself. They seem to be everywhere and give the spectator an incredible range of focuses and points of view. I\\'ve never been truly excited by the musical performances during the festival, but there are some great acts and the multi-screen editing set them perfectly off (funny to watch the contrast between the blues-country-rock white bands and the glitter-dance-sexy background singer bound \"Sly and the family Stone\"!). Glad that Janis Joplin\\'s wonderful and sincere performance has been added in the director\\'s cut... As someone else wrote here, one of the main revelation in this movie is how the attendees are young. It\\'s really about American young people at a peculiar period in western history, when the \"baby boom\" brought a new, numerous generation \"on stage\". When western countries were really young, with lot of innocence. One (swimming) girl in the film stresses that. She says \"we are gathering in many cities in the world\" \"we come over\". And that\\'s true : 3 days long, young people made Woodstock a unique event. They overcome global media hostility, long walk, crowded and muddy field, food shortage, etc (well, that\\'s what youth is for!). Thanks to Wadleigh to have capture it (and thanks to the perfect re-mastering). PS : I\\'m sure that no full-of-money-movie-maker filming a musical festival these present days would make an interview of the-man-who-is-in-charge-of-the chemical-toilets (who has a son here and another one piloting a chopper in Vietnam)!

This film lingers without languishing, it draws you in. Emotionally charged, it captivates - truly a thing of artistic beauty! See this film if you love to watch dance. See it if you dance.

I agree that the sub-plots of the President and his wife, staff, drug addictions and family members did not add to the presentation of this predictable storyline. The original was exciting and entertaining. We too are upset that we anticipated so much more from the cast and were ripped off.

But when they began to disappear one-by-one, replaced by scattered, bloodied body parts and voodoo effigies, the remaining few scramble for their lives. But he\\'s out there. And he\\'s sick. And all he wants is blood...\" So obviously from the get-go it doesn\\'t make sense: why is this clown in the woods to begin with? Why a clown? Why are their dolls with the word \"food\" drawn on them? Why why why? Hardly anything gets answered in this 1 hour 30 min. bore fest except where this clown lives. The characters are dumb guys, dumb girls, and a hell of a lot of bitchiness. One in particular is a girl whom they brought from a restaurant up the road, whom they thought they should help because she was getting hassled by some guy she knew. What warrants that as an excuse to bring a girl into your circle of friends or their cabin? She, of course, begins planting seeds of jealousy, having the men have sex with her by feeding their dumb minds everything they want to hear.<br /><br />The music was an average affair (standard frantic keyboard music like in every horror film without differences). The actors seemed to be brought from some soap opera the way they complained and whined about everything. The idea that the main guy in the film takes this girl to the cabin as their first date makes for a horrible date, but of course, she unrealistically gives herself to him on the first night of getting to know him. There was hardly a budget spent of anything, it seems, but there was a clown outfit and plenty of cheap $1-store dolls lying around in the woods, which was a horribly bland place to shoot this whole movie (been done too many times). I was also waiting for the clown to jump into the house to kill the remaining 4 characters of the film (in through the glass maybe), but nothing exciting like that ever entered the film. I guess you were just supposed to like the clown being a killer or something.<br /><br />I had to give the film a 3. It was an interesting premise (clown as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre character, essentially) and I\\'ll give them a star for acting serious all the way through when the movie could\\'ve totally been a B-movie-style video, but they opted for the more legitimate style of video.

The characters were deep, sympathetic, and non-clichéd, and the story lines were very original. Congratulations to the ladies in CLAMP for creating such a beautiful story.<br /><br />That said, what on earth was this? Both of the Tokyo Babylon movies were more like bonus features - \"Okay, you read the manga, here\\'s some other cool adventures they got up to!\" Which is a nice thought, but it really has no purpose. You cannot condense a series like this into a couple of movies - they tried it with X and it didn\\'t work, they tried it with TB and it worked even less. There was none of the depth, none of the message, none of the character development - it turned into just another comic book, a collector\\'s item.<br /><br />It was also rather irritating (TOUCHY SUBJECT ALERT) that half of the plot was ignored. Let\\'s face it, folks, Tokyo Babylon is, in large part, a homosexual love story, learn to live with it. In the first TB movie, it seemed that Sakurazuka Seishiro\\'s romantic advances were targeted more towards Sumeragi Hokuto than Sumeragi Subaru, and in this one, they were almost completely absent. Without this major part of the story, Seishiro is worthless - he becomes another clichéd villain.<br /><br />The animation was very pretty (as it always is in shojo) and the voicing couldn\\'t have been better.

It is a film for the young crowd, perhaps 5 to 11 years of age. I thought it was a nice change of pace from the adult films that pervade the screen these days. There is no realism here or accuracy about life in general for adults or kids.

I absolutely adored everything that I have been acquainted previously. But lately I've been running out of resources to sustain my fancy. I still have couple of books left, but they are either in transit or they are the sequels which I am not in a hurry to read. So an idea dawned on me - Sink me! There are movies which I have not watched! Thus, I must watch them immediately.<br /><br />The first five minutes of these series were... acceptable. In fact, I quite enjoyed the variation of the reason for the denunciation, however different it had seemed. It went all downhill from there, though. Chauvelin was too... foppish? And, I daresay, too old for this role. Not nearly that dark and dashing figure with his dreadful either-or. (And what was that with random bed scene featuring him? It was way too creepy - wasn't his only love the Madame Guillotine, and his only interest - his job, and his only obsession - Sir Percy?) Marguerite... Prettiest woman in France? Cleverest woman in Europe? I think not. Although, whatever compelled her to break into the study of Sir Percy I haven't the faintest idea. And whatever my Lord Tony has done to deserve this death? Yes, every member of the League did pledge his life to Sir Percy, but he would have never endangered any of them nor would have run away like a coward when his dear friend faces mortal danger. And if by any means he had to mourn his companion, he would have done that, mourn, not just move on as if nothing had happened. Which brings me to another point, Sir Percy. His portrayal was most dreadful. He was neither a lazy fop, nor a gallant and elusive hero who is a master of transformations. Nor did he care too much about cravats (his pronunciation of that word alone made my ears bleed) And with his own hands he had never killed anyone. So what was that with him randomly walking around and slaughtering people?<br /><br />The costumes were just too flashy for that time period as well. This is post-revolutionary France we are talking about! Not pre-revolutionary. People in dresses like that stand out in a crowd quite easily. It was all just... gah!<br /><br />Although, I must admit, after I watched other parts my opinion did change slightly. Watching it as a separate work, independent of Scarlet Pimpernel series, it was tolerable. Just your other average hero in the mask.

I recorded a subsequent airing of the film a year or two later and kept watching the Ramones concert sequences over and over again, thinking \"Man, these guys kick ass!

I will say that there is a good idea for a movie here (it made me think about how few films there are about the Irish Revolution) but, as usual, Ford is determined to bury it under over-acting and cheap sentiment. I suppose it\\'s somewhat interesting to watch for a while in order to see the less-than-seamless transition that was being made from the silents to the \"talkies\" -- the acting styles of some of the principals have that overbroad quality endemic to early films and movie does feel as if it might play better with title cards than spoken dialogue. (Of course, title cards would prevent Ford from restating every bit of emotion six times.) What dialogue there is usually has a \"They\\'re always after me Lucky Charms!\" quality that is aggravated by the fact that each actor seems to have been allowed to use his or her own personal version of an Irish accent. Of course, as bad as they are, the accents are helpful in reminding us we\\'re in Ireland because the sets mostly look as if they were dragged in from from some German expressionist piece being filmed on the next soundstage over. (It feels as if, with an eagle eye, you might see some villagers off to torch Dr. Frankenstein in the background.)<br /><br />Techniques change. Tastes change. So I won\\'t go off on how crazy it seems that this film was so acclaimed in its day.

The school in the present time looked like a strong candidate for the Battle Royale competition (which I thought the film would eventually rib, but never did). The main character, a composed young man decides to enroll despite possessing higher education, but soon regrets after his not-too-bright friend flunks the \\'subtraction exam\\'. Some promising sidekicks get introduced, including Takayama\\'s character who hates all types of transportation and decides to help the hijackers of a plane just so they wouldn\\'t fly. The film showed much potential, but sidetracked twenty minutes in after shelving these winning characters and spending way too much time with the intros of the gorillas and the \"Hard Gay\" man who ended up offering very little throughout the film. And where the hell were the Freddie Mercury impersonations?<br /><br />Yes the film needed such off the map characters (like the depressed Pootans), that was a given, but it failed to realize what direction to go with and what characters/situations to stick with in its full feature form. A perfect example of film-making where it seemed like the direction had no working script, just sketchy gags thought out by the crew late at night. Simply putting a blonde wig on an evil alien ape and calling the duo, Gori and Lla wasn\\'t enough to tickle my funny bone. Spoofing of the Exorcist with a possessed robot, revealed to have only been infested with a cat was just a wasted, lazy attempt at parody. Again, I wasn\\'t looking for sensible comedy or in-depth characters here, but even as a sleazy, low budget com-oddity, this film failed to keep me laughing and to exceed the wacky goods and true characteristics of the anime show. But, if you find these types of films irresistible and are a die hard fan of the show then I guess you\\'ll watch and enjoy this movie regardless, as it was mainly aimed at its fan-base.',\n"," 'The GREAT NEWS is that this film is now AVAILABLE on DVD from http://treasureflix.com for all those who wish to own it as well as on video.This is good news as it is one of my favourite films!<br /><br />I watched this film for the first time in the 80s and it is compulsory holiday viewing.

Except for Jack Elam in one of his very first screen roles; he actually was a rather good looking guy back then. That might have been the single treat in the film for me.<br /><br />It\\'s curious how all of these exploitation films wind up with a handful of different titles.

He\\'s a dead ringer for a young Jack Nicholson, and if I didn\\'t know better, I would have been checking the credits to see if it was him or not. Another weird thing was the use of that eerie sci-fi/Twilight Zone type music whenever folks on screen were shown puffing on the dreaded weed.

Wouldn\\'t it be great if the Coen Brothers took the idea of these exploitation flicks and made one of their own? You could really get some mileage out of characters portrayed by John Tuturro, Jon Polito, and Steve Buscemi.

Trust me because after seeing this \"film\" you may want to seek remedial attention.',\n"," 'Possibly attempting to do for the world of finance what she\\'d done to nuclear power in \"The China Syndrome\"(1979), this Jane Fonda melodrama is a poor investment for any serious movie fan.<br /><br />The story is very hard to follow and poorly constructed with shallow characters. The story is not terribly easy to grasp for the average person in my opinion and not presented to the audience clearly enough-nor well enough to garner much interest and/or curiosity. Fonda appears bored, while still trying to appear smart and glamorous, in her role. Kris Kristofferson is simply a case of very bad casting. Despite some efforts to make him physically appear like a big-time banker, he comes off flat and stiff in his role. Whether talking down a bank president or talking Fonda into bed, all his lines are delivered in a blank monotone style that conveys nothing. We also are never given much background or motivation for the events and doings of the people wandering about this epic of high finance. Fonda and Kristofferson\\'s first meeting isn\\'t much of an icebreaker, yet the two are bedding down together by their second or third encounter.<br /><br />The film is directed by Alan J. Pakula and it looks much like other works for him. Secret meetings in parking lots and suspect late night boardroom conferences may appear to be the things that make up a good thriller, but here they are simply padding between the great nothingness that amounts to two-hours of dull slow paced cliche filled dialog from weak characters that you never grow to care much about. The movie\\'s heavy-handed and overly-dramatic musical score makes many scenes nearly laughable.<br /><br />There\\'s little to recommended beyond those morbidly curious to see a bad movie, which is why I obtained a copy of it. On that level, it does pay a modest dividend.',\n"," 'If \"Johnny Tsunami\" is the feel-good film of 1999, then \"The Other Me\" has got to be the feel-good film of 2000.<br /><br />I like this movie for so many reasons, including that it\\'s fun to watch, it has great music, and it teaches an important lesson without getting preachy. Andrew Lawrence proved that he can hold his own as not one, but two main characters, as well as proving that he is not just a pretty face in the camera. Everybody who is casted in the movie (including Brendan Jefferson) did a great job, too.<br /><br />When I saw this movie for the first time, I was amazed by what a good job they did, and when it was over, I want to see it again.<br /><br />The one thing that sets this movie apart from other D.C.O.M.s is that you can relate to Will Browning, because you know how he feels and what he has gone through.<br /><br />The message of the movie is that you have to be not just yourself, but your best self.<br /><br />I really love this movie, and I hope it goes out on Disney DVD.',\n"," 'Not very interesting teen whodunit saved from being a turkey from some decent performances. The main cast consisting of Taye Diggs, Mia Kirshner, Dominique Swain and surprisingly Meredith Monroe are all good but the story is not very original.',\n"," 'Flat out one of the worst movies I\\'ve ever seen in my life.<br /><br />I got it from a friend who had bought the DVD without viewing it before...it was so horrible that he gave it to me just to get it out of his house.<br /><br />I honestly couldn\\'t finish it. It was that bad.<br /><br />The script is a mishmash of every \"successful\" gimmic over the past five years, the acting is second rate, the special effects look straight out of 1994 and the editing leaves you scratching your head.<br /><br />None of the actors seem to know what the heck they\\'re doing there. As soon as you realize this, you wonder what you\\'re doing watching it. Its like sticking around at a party no one wants to be at. Its not fun and no one wanted to be there in the first place.<br /><br />Thumbs WAY down.',\n"," \"Here's why the Jane Show won't work. Once again Canadian bonehead producers and writers can't create a sitcom without putting some kind of different spin on it. I guess these people don't watch a lot of T.V. from the U.S. which has the sitcom model down pat. No, here we have to do something different, we have to make the A story absolutely absurd and then have a meaningful B story to try to make up for it. The characters are two dimensional and the story lines are way over the top: Forklift races??? give me freaking break. Here's a little advice for the writers of the show, Don't write funny situations, find the funny in situations. And remember, you have to be born with a sense of humor to write truly funny stuff, not just be an improv monkey.\",\n"," \"Solar Attack is about a large coronal mass ejection (CME) from the sun that threatens to ignite the atmosphere and kill everyone. The president must try and make the right decision and he only has one chance. The scientists and advisors are split, but the president errs on the side of caution and authorizes some dangerous operations. While this film deals with a lesser known extinction level event, the science is still dubious as presented. For the most part, the performances aren't convincing and seems rushed. I think this has more to do with the directing rather than the acting. Dialog is common with little snap. I doubt that even big name actors could have pulled this out of the C+ range. Special effects were nonspecific, general, and unrealistic.\",\n"," 'In the opening scene of \"Slow Burn,\" an assistant district attorney (Jolene Blalock) is found wandering the streets of the city, disheveled and confused, informing those who find her that she has just killed a rapist in self defense. The alleged attacker (Mekhi Phifer) was a man she supposedly met one night in a record store and who then proceeded to stalk her for weeks thereafter. Suddenly, into the head D.A.\\'s office strides LL Cool J, as a friend of the deceased who has a considerably different story to tell about the events leading up to the murder as well as an entirely disparate take on the couple\\'s relationship. Things get even more dicey when we discover that the D.A. (Ray Liotta) and the assistant D.A. have been conducting a torrid affair of their own for a number of years now.<br /><br />\"Slow Burn\" fails on so many levels of rudimentary storytelling and film-making that it\\'s hard to know where exactly to begin in compiling a list of its shortcomings. To start with, there\\'s something inherently self-defeating and pointless in constructing a narrative from two widely conflicting viewpoints - a la \"Rashomon\" - when one of the supposed eyewitnesses is already dead and, thus, unable to personally relate his side of the story. How does it enhance the verisimilitude of the tale if most of our information has to come filtered down to us through a secondhand source, a person who wasn\\'t even present at the events he\\'s describing - unless, of course, he was hiding in a nearby closet during all those \"intimate\" moments he is able to recount in such juicy and exhaustive detail? Either that or the murder victim was one of the chattiest, kiss-and-tell gossips in the history of the movies. And why does it take till the closing reels for the supposedly intelligent professional investigators to smell a rat in that setup? Eventually, the twist-and-turn plotting leads to so much incoherence and confusion that you might well wonder if the filmmakers themselves understood what it was they were doing.<br /><br />Beyond the clumsy, inscrutable storytelling, \"Slow Burn\" also suffers from some of the most overripe dialogue this side of \"The Black Dahlia.\" With such knee-slapping howlers as \"She stood there like a tangerine, ripe and ready to be peeled\" and \"She walked in smelling like mashed potatoes and every guy within thirty feet wanted to be the gravy,\" the script could easily win First Prize in a Bad Film Noir Writing contest. It\\'s hard to believe at such times that the film isn\\'t actually intended to be a parody (the acting sure suggests it on occasion). On second thought, perhaps it would be best to stick with that notion; it just might go down easier that way.',\n"," \"I don't see how I could possibly spoil this movie, as I'm pretty sure most people know Valentino is dead. The manner of his death spoiled the movie for me, fact-based viewer that I am. This movie is a five-car pileup -- you can't look away. Nureyev is no actor, but it hardly matters. This must be the noisiest movie ever made about the silent era. Even Seymour Cassel, known for his work with John Cassavetes, soon joins in the general shouting and gesticulating. The two-whatevers rating is for the costume one of the women wears to the funeral, which makes her look like a Klimt painting. It made me laugh.<br /><br />Please, Ken, leave Garbo alone.\",\n"," \"After watching this film I experienced a new sensation. I had watched a film in which the lead actor had put in a performance that almost rivaled the legend Chevy Chase in 'Fletch'. This isn't to say that the performances are comparable, but both give practically flawless delivery of their lines. That actor is Marc Singer! Singer is Jack Ford, the 'Droid Gunner' of the title, grinding out a living collecting the bounty on androids.There are some mutants, topless pleasure droids(!), a Scandinavian smuggler, and possibly a half-hearted attempt to make a statement on class or maybe even globalization or......... well it doesn't really matter. What matters about this film is the dry manner in which Singer delivers his lines resulting in side-splitting humour! What matters about this film is that director Fred Olen Ray seems to realize that serious sci-fi very rarely works, and when your budget is skimpy it is best not to take yourself to seriously. Olen Ray has said that everyone involved in this film had great fun and this transfers onto the film.I dare you to criticize a film that allows itself to portray futuristic Earth as eternally dark and neon-lit and then ends in a 'pipes and valves' warehouse. Self parody is a very redeeming quality. To summarise, Fred Olen Ray is an ambassador for independent film making and Marc Singer the perfect B-movie lead.If only Olen Ray could draft in Tim Thomerson to the equation then we'd have a film on our hands.\",\n"," \"When it comes to films about terrorism, the Hollywood market is one dominated by the exploits of cowboys and tough-headed, no-crap Americanism that one might get a kick out of every now and again if it doesn't take itself too seriously (Die Hard), but too often submerges any substance and truth to the situation by trying to please the popcorn-munching audience members too eagerly. Such ventures into the often complex and extremely conflicted area of politics, war and current social prejudices are subsequently left alone by those the film ostensibly tries to draw in (those looking for intelligent, insightful political drama) and instead adopted and loved by people riveted by your average Michael Bay movie. It's just about safe to say that those movies have their place, as most movies do, but that when you start mixing real-life affairs\\x97and especially those linked to such acts as terrorism and religion\\x97you begin unravelling something that really should be left alone if you're not going to deal with it in a dignified manner.<br /><br />Traitor, which comes from director Jeffrey Nachemanoff (known for his script The Day After Tomorrow), certainly doesn't shy away from this sense of action that permeates the average political action thriller, but it isn't ruled or dominated by it either. Instead the movie exists as a tightly wound, exciting experience, but one that draws far more of its compelling moments from elements grounded in reality through both ethical discussion and the characters that drive the thing forward. The usual twists and turns in narrative are here (so much so that I'm consciously going to avoid giving any form of a synopsis for the sake of preserving vital turning points), but they refuse to submit to banal contrivances and absurd mystery tangents that take far too long to reveal themselves. Rather, Nachemanoff fools the viewer many times and keeps them guessing as to where all of this is going, yet never neglects them to being mere witnesses to a bunch of calloused details and bullets flying around the screen. The script is well paced and focused, with plenty of time-out segments that develop character and plot significantly, with little excess.<br /><br />One could argue that perhaps Traitor is a little too long for it's own good; there are moments where the movie slows down to snail's pace for the sake of filling in plot holes and making sure the viewer is up to speed with what is going on, but such instances never become overbearing, nor do they drown out any tension developed up until that point. Yet without these points, Traitor wouldn't be quite the experience it is, mainly because a lot of the movie's ability to draw you in through its central characters, their moral dilemmas involving what they feel they have to do, and the repercussions of such actions. By tackling such detailed issues head-on, Nachemanoff makes sure to avoid the pitfalls of your common political thriller; the decisions presented here are presented exactly as such; there are consequences, there are doubts and there are conflicts inside and outside said people that manifest throughout and permeate the entire feature; Traitor dances with the people behind the FBI suits and the skull-caps, and it makes sure that they aren't mere action-movie caricatures for the sake of preserving its ultimate drawing point\\x97reality.<br /><br />Of course, a large portion of the movie's ability to suspend disbelief is through the performances of the central cast who embody their characters with a convincing sense of realism throughout. Here, nobody is safe, and a few important characters bite the bullet, yet often they will come and go without melodramatic excess, imbued with a dramatic but grounded temperament. While I could go on about each of the actors' performances here, it must be stated that the key portrayal comes from lead man Don Cheadle who reminds us once more of the talent he has for nuanced subtlety that he so obviously possesses. In the end however, it's this consistency in grit and cerebrally engaging tone that makes Traitor a far greater whole than the sum of its parts. By no means is it a perfect motion picture; as a movie it lacks an immediately definable structure that meanders from time to time, and the eventual conclusion does feel a little half-baked, but for the most part, Nachemanoff does well to craft an intelligent and subdued take on a genre too often obsessed with gung-ho escapades and mawkish sentiments.<br /><br />- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)\",\n"," \"This is truly one of the funniest movies, I've seen. I used to watch it several times a week. I highly recommend this one if you like offbeat comedies. One of the funniest things was something I didn't even notice the first three times I saw it...What you ask? The names of the main characters...Burt and Ernie. That's right folks, the two cops are named after two of your favorite childhood friends. ENJOY!!\",\n"," \"Admittedly, I tuned into this in the hopes of seeing some beefcake shots of James Brolin. Unfortunately, there was only one, early on, and the rest of the movie was very tame, and ultimately made little sense.<br /><br />The story, what there is of it, centers on Nick and Julie Atkins, a couple whose marriage of many years is beginning to grow stale. Nick, a successful businessman is focused on work to the point of neglecting Julie, who tries to fill the void by going back to school. Julie's longing for the passion that she and Nick had early in their marriage begins to take shape in the form of powerful sexual fantasies which block out reality for minutes at a time, causing her to do things like burning breakfast and misplace her husband's papers. At first she fantasizes about her husband, but as the movie progresses, she begins to fantasize about other men, and about encounters with random strangers whom she meets. This culminates in her acting out her fantasies with disastrous consequences for her marriage. Can she and her husband rebuild their relationship? Is it worth saving? <br /><br />This could have been an interesting premise, but the execution is so bland that you wonder why they even bothered. Characters aren't developed. Motives aren't explained. Background information isn't given. No exploration is made of how Julie got to the point where she couldn't control herself, and no explanation is offered as to how she will do so in the future. The end product is a muddled mess which is just as confusing as Julie's fantasies, which are surprisingly underdeveloped.<br /><br />The acting is a mixed bag. Donna Mills as Julie does well with the material she is given, although her continual self pity does become strident after awhile. James Brolin acts as though he is reading his lines from cue cards, and even his anger over his wife's infidelity is hard to buy into, he shows so little passion over the whole issue. The supporting roles are mostly forgettable.<br /><br />Disappointing treatment of what could have been an interesting story. More's the pity, since it doesn't even offer the eye candy it promised.\",\n"," \"Having seen the first ten episodes, I must say this show sucks. <br /><br />What bothers me the most, is that the show was shot in Canada. I know it's cheaper, but they should have shot it in California, so we could have had scenes in the desert. That would have been more true to the movie. The first scene where they are outside in another world is in the mountains, with lots of pinetrees where it looks cold. That does'nt feel very Egyptian. What worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in the ancient Egypt. Here it feels like they're running around fighting aliens in a Canadian forrest. And it's so lame that appaerantly, on other planets, the fall comes as well. You can see leaves on the ground in the forrests that all look like forrests outside Vancouver. It just makes the show even more unbelievable and dumb. <br /><br />And then there is Richard Dean Anderson. He is no Kurt Russel. Sure he does a decent job and he tries to copy Russels performance a little bit, but he is just not as cool as Russel. And not nearly as good an actor as Russel. And Russells way of playing O Neill, well he was much more cynical. Andersons O Neil, is way too soft. I liked it that Russels version just did'nt give a s*** and had no trouble detonating the bomb until the very end of the movie. <br /><br />Michael Shanks does a really good job as Jackson though taking over from James Spader.<br /><br />Teal'c is a really annoying character. He is Jaffa. Not a Jaffa. Just Jaffa. Aaaarrgh!! A former bodyguard of a pathetic Ra character, seen only in the pilot and in one other episode so far. Teal'c speaks talks and acts like a robot. I've seen better acting from Jean Claude Van Damme.<br /><br />And the fact that Teal'c and the Ra character and the people they saved in the movie, can speak English all of a sudden is also incredibly dumb. What made the aliens so scary in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters. <br /><br />As for the special effects, they are really good in the pilot. But the very rare effects in the actual show are badly done and looks cheap. Especially a planet they visit with crystals. It's so obvious they walk around on a soundstage with a badly made painting in the background. It's an insult to us viewers that they made it look so cheap. Especially when they could have made it in front of a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds. <br /><br />The X-files had better effects when they aired their first episodes in 1993. That was 4 years before SG-1 started. And they did'nt have the apparent two million dollar budget per episode, that SG-1 supposedly had. They must have spend all the money on catering. Because I don't see it on the screen. <br /><br />Incredibly boring and pointless show, that could have been great if they had shot the show in Hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters.\",\n"," \"Fantastic, Madonna at her finest, the film is funny and her acting is brilliant.

Fantastic.\",\n"," \"There are only two even half-good reasons to watch this limp, atypical version of the Frankenstein story. And both of them can be found inside \\x96 just \\x96 Kate O'Mara's blouse.<br /><br />It's rubbish, pure and simple, all the more surprisingly so considering a) it was written and directed by Jimmy Sangster, one of the half dozen most important names in the history of Hammer films; and b) it has an absolutely top-notch cast: as well as Ralph Bates (who Hammer were grooming to take over Peter Cushing's mantle; never happened) we get uber-Hammer babe Veronica Carlson, the aforementioned Miss O'Mara \\x96 as gorgeous, pouting and shapely a starlet as ever graced a Hammer flick (she can't act for toffee, but who cares?) \\x96 the criminally underrated and underused Jon Finch, and the brilliant Dennis Price.<br /><br />Sangster's screenplay is weak. It tries hard to be funny, but succeeds only in being puerile. And his direction is workmanlike at best. There is little real action, certainly not the sort of action you expect from a Hammer Frankenstein movie. The gore quotient is minimal, and the naked bazooka count zero \\x96 odd, considering female nudity was Hammer's big USP in the early 70s, and Sangster's only other directorial effort for Hammer, Lust for a Vampire, was replete with a multitude of heaving bosoms. (Apparently Kate O'Mara refused to appear topless, which makes you wonder how she got the part in the first place, but never mind.) Most of the DIY brain surgery takes place off screen, and the monster, played by muscleman and soon-to-be Darth Vader David Prowse, is about as frightening as an ice cream cone. He's supposedly been stitched together in the usual way, from assorted local unfortunates, but for some reason he has the body of a Greek god. The only concession to his patchwork creation is stitching scars that look like they've been drawn on with lipstick.<br /><br />The plot isn't worth outlining \\x96 Sangster clearly didn't spend much time on it, so neither will I \\x96 and there are some annoyingly stupid bits of business which mean that the film doesn't work, even on its own jokey level. (For example, the monster isn't strong enough to pull his shackles out of the wall, but he makes matchwood out of a solid oak door.) Unless you're a Hammer completist I'd give this one a miss. If it does happen to come your way, as it did mine, on satellite TV late one night, try and stay awake for Kate O'Mara's appearance in a see-through nightie, then switch off. (She gets killed off soon after anyway. Probably died of shame.)\",\n"," \"I can't say too much about Kalifornia as sadly I have yet to actually see the whole thing (I've only managed to see it in bits and pieces on Fuse.) But what I have seen is absolutely awesome! I am a fan of Brad Pitt but I admit not all his earlier movies are well good. But this role, I just, his acting is great, his character Early seems so normal well okay creepy, dark weird but you know normal for a hillbilly of that type I guess. And Juliette Lewis's performance although I can see how some may be annoyed by it I think it's amazing. Sadly I have yet to see the end, but from reading other reviews on here it sounds good, but disappointing. I have to admit that I wish David Duchovany's (sorry if the spelling on that is incorrect) was a bit flat but for him it was okay. His wife's character was better, and I thought her performance while not the best in the movie was pretty good, a portrait of the avant-Gard/older sister type. Particularly the scene where Early and Brian go to play pool, and Adele and Carrie are having their one on one time together. I've watched that scene at least twice now and I still think the acting in it is just wonderful. One because of the emotion that Adele portrays after talking about being raped by the three guys and how she feels about Early and Carrie's reaction to it. Everything about that I think is just so perfect. I mean, maybe it's because I can relate a bit, I'm not sure. <br /><br />As for Brad Pitt who plays the serial killer that we actually get to see for once; I thought he was great. Some movies with Pitt that I've seen were just average or not worth seeing. I don't think I've ever seen a terrible Pitt movie or if I have it's not because of his acting it's other factors. This movie was not one of them. He turned out a great performance in Kalifornia. I swear I'm not just some random I do like him for his acting not just because he's good looking, I mean his character in this movie isn't exactly handsome or cute by any means! Pitt is dark, brooding and downright scary at times. Yet he's also cheerful, funny, nice, and even loving towards Adele. Granted there are some spots that made me want to reach through the TV and strangle him but that's probably just me (and the character Pitt played in the movie.) But it also shows how good Pitt's acting was in this movie it made me forget that he was playing a character, that is what good acting is supposed to do. <br /><br />At any rate I wish I could say more, but that's all I can really say without having seen the ending, I have seen most of the movie through what I've caught on Fuse and as I'm writing this I'm taping it on DVR so hopefully I can write a more complete review later. I just wanted to share my thoughts on a movie that I thought was something really cool and something that seems to have gotten overlooked (it shouldn't have!)\",\n"," \"I rented this movie last week. I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman were on it, so it seemed promising. And it was, until Justin Timberlake came on scene. He is a really bad actor and shouldn't be allowed to make a movie ever again. I mean, he is one of the most boring, uninspired actors I've ever seen. He puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever. Why the hell was he cast for the role of Josh Pollack? I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment. His character is so dull, it seems like a bad mix of his character in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en. It might sound cool, but believe me, it's not.<br /><br />Now, Dylan McDermott's acting is very good. It's about one of the very few good things about this movie. He is just inspired.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is good but nothing special. He has some really cool lines though.<br /><br />About the story, although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good. I was expecting a big twist when Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) was killed, but nothing really happened.\",\n"," \"This is an extremely good film - highly recommended. It will not be to everyone's taste, but if you are not afraid of thinking during a film then you should find plenty to take away from this one.<br /><br />Bad Guy is a film based on the central premise of a relationship built between what is effectively a hostage-taker and his hostage. What transpires is a stream of abuses, power-shifts, emotional turmoil, love, hate, violence, sex, and almost every other aspect of life. This is an extremely original story, well told, with fascinating characters that are extremely human... both the good and bad sides of humanity.<br /><br />The production values are very high, great acting, direction, cinematography, script, music, everything is top notch. <br /><br />Typically, Korean films are very much based in real characters, social issues, and have an earthy approach that humanises their films beyond those of most countries. Bad Guy is no exception... while it is violent, confrontational, and decidedly dark, it bristles with underlying emotion and shows life without the rose coloured glasses. <br /><br />The characters are at times extremely emotional, and at others almost entirely emotionally void as they struggle constantly to keep their balance in circumstances that are spiraling around them.<br /><br />This is not an 'easy' film, in that it does not hand feed the viewer, there are no 'Jaws' style music queues to let you know when to be scared. You will need to work out how to feel for yourself with this one, which is fairly rare in this day and age. <br /><br />As said earlier, this movie is not for everyone, however if the concept sounds like something that interests you, then you should enjoy this film. If on the other hand you don't like the idea of watching a film based on the idea of a man forcing a woman into a life of sexual servitude, then stay well away from this film.\",\n"," 'This has become one of my favorite movies and certainly one of the best westerns I have ever seen. Having a soft spot for the genre (westerns are \\x96 or were, since they are no longer made very often \\x96 morality plays that too often have been denigrated by critics with intellectual pretensions), I purchased the DVD, sight unseen, because I had read enough about William S. Hart\\'s work (much of which he wrote and directed) to pique my interest and thought I should have at least one of his films in my video collection.<br /><br />I must admit that I approached the actual viewing with some trepidation. My previous experiences with silent cinema \"classics\" had left me feeling let down. Chaney\\'s The Phantom of the Opera, Griffith\\'s Birth of a Nation and Fairbanks\\' The Mark of Zorro were fine, but not nearly as good as their reputations would lead one to expect. They were either too long, or too theatrical, or both. <br /><br />The Toll Gate, however, emerged as a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />It is a story told in a simple and straightforward manner. Black Deering (played by Hart), leader of a notoriously successful outlaw gang, thinks the time has come for group to disband, before its luck runs out. He is, however, opposed by his chief lieutenant, Jordan, who goads them all into one last holdup by promising great wealth but leads them into a trap in which he is complicit. Everyone is killed except Deering, who is taken prisoner. When his captors recognize him as the man who once saved a number of soldiers and settlers by warning an outpost of an impending Indian attack, they allow him to escape. Free, he tries to find honest work but is snubbed and ridiculed and ultimately must rob again to survive. Soon, he is pursued not only by the sheriff\\'s posse but also by Jordan (now prospering from the reward money he has collected) and his henchmen. His flight leads him to a remote cabin inhabited by a single mother and her little son. After some initial misgivings, they take him into their hearts. Deering sees a chance for a new life but, with the posse and Jordan closing in, realizes that this may not be possible. <br /><br />Hart was the first great western star and the first to inject realism into the genre. As one of the pioneers of movie-making, he created many of the characters and situations that have become cliché in westerns for more than ninety years. What keeps his movies interesting, however, was his ability to go beyond the cliché (perhaps his imitators did not go far enough) so that the material appears fresh and innovative, even now. Three such instances in The Toll Gate illustrate this: <br /><br />1) In one scene, his character shoots into a crowd in an attempt to kill Jordan, and kills a bystander instead. A subsequent close-up shows that he is clearly frustrated. The frustration, however, comes not from the fact that he has gunned down a man who had hitherto caused him no harm but that he missed his intended target. <br /><br />2) In another, as he flees from the posse, his \"borrowed\" horse steps into a gopher hole and breaks a leg. Hart pulls out his gun to put the animal out of its misery but, before pulling the trigger, gives his head a sad, loving pat, as if to say farewell to an old friend. <br /><br />3) And finally, after he has strangled Jordan and thrown his body over a cliff, he returns to retrieve his guns and spots his adversary\\'s pistol lying on the ground nearby. He steps forward and gives it a swift kick before mounting his horse. It is a simple gesture but it underscores the deep loathing he feels for the man who betrayed him and his comrades. <br /><br />And I love the title, The Toll Gate. It is allegorical in its implication that a man cannot begin a new life until he has paid for the sins of his old one. Deering\\'s payment comes in the form of sacrifice. Today\\'s more sophisticated audiences may not buy into that sentiment entirely but it can still work on you if you let it.<br /><br />Viewers who like their videos in pristine condition will undoubtedly object to the DVD\\'s picture quality, especially the badly deteriorated final reel. I don\\'t mind at all. That a copy of this 1920 movie even exists at all is a miracle since prints of so many other silent movies have been lost. If you bear that in mind and look upon the film as a piece of history, its visual flaws are not that difficult to accept. <br /><br />William S. Hart was born in 1870 in New York but grew up in the Minnesota and Wisconsin where he learned to speak Sioux and Indian sign language. He counted Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson among his friends and collected Remington paintings, so his knowledge of the West was first-hand. If his vision seems overly romanticized by today\\'s standards, it is nevertheless rooted far closer to reality than the spaghetti westerns of the \\'60s and \\'70s and the revisionist works that followed.

The day after consuming a few too many vodka martinis and Cosmopolitans mixed with a bunch of bubbly at midnight, my wife and I discovered the local cable company is offering up the digital specialty channels for free for the month of January. We had a choice - do we make use of the freebie channels or do we start watching the eight seasons of X-Files on DVD that we received from our daughter for Christmas?<br /><br />We elected for the digital freebie since the DVDs are going nowhere and we need something like ten twelve-hour days to watch all the X-Files beginning to end. The Drive-In channel was offering a horror classic three movie marathon: Asylum (1972), House of the Damned (1996) and The Pit and the Pendulum (1961). Asylum is well-reviewed here and the Pit and the Pendulum was on too late for us to watch which meant we could really only be properly critical for House of the Damned.<br /><br />To be honest, we tried to be serious about the movie since its stars have reasonably good acting credentials - Greg Evigan (William Shatner's over-written Tekwars) and Alexandra Paul (the only Baywatch babe who could act although she has the body of a ten-year-old boy). Unfortunately, we soon dissolved to giggles, under the influence of a little hair-of-the-dog, as we each shouted out the names of movies from which this dog borrowed its scenes: Poltergeist, The Shining, Hell House, House On Haunted Hill, Ghost Busters!<br /><br />The acting, especially by Evigan's real-life daughter, wasn't too bad considering the silly script they had to work with. The CGI, for 1996, was hilarious - at its worst point in the final scene when it should have been the most horrific it was so bad my wife and I dissolved in laughter.<br /><br />Overall: Acting 4/5, Script 2/5, SFX 0/5\",\n"," \"Yes, it's a strange movie.

Mark Frost was Jim Carrey in a Gore movie but I liked his Faust part of the role. The psychiatrist character and actress are the most defined and well worked ones. The FX were right (wonderful make-up, specially the Van Campen-turns-into-DesireWoman one: horny at the beginning and more disturbing as it went on). But the mix of bad acting, Spawn-theft plot and bad worked scenes and connections didn't leave me clear one thing: did I like this movie?

Standout sequence for me is when Hedges (and we) think 5c have gone to bed for the night and he heads off to the pub with Price... only to bump into his pupils there.

Once again, the plot is lightweight and forgettable, but watching Fred and Ginger dance together is sheer heaven.

That and ruining whatever build up in pace and rhythm the movie might have had before.<br /><br />So first it confuses you and then it puts you off.

At first I thought Samir Horn(Don Cheadle) was trying to infiltrate the terrorist organization who are suicide bombers that believes in something like the Qur\\'an by earning there trust, but later it seemed that he was actually loyal to the terrorist organization or even a double agent. And thought it would show the film in the terrorist point of view from the main character, which probably wouldn\\'t have sit right with most Americans. But later it is revealed that he does work for a organization that is trying to take down the terrorist group leader Nathir and get a hold of the terrorist plans. Even while playing this guessing game, I didn\\'t feel cheated because it was well crafted and gave some clues. I found the whole premise of Samir going to prison in order to befriend Omar who is a member of the terrorist organization a bit over the top, but there is way more over the top stuff that happens in these types of genres. I found the joke about how the suicide bombers are on a mission to get laid with 72 virgins pretty funny. Since it is pretty much the truth, but the film shows that not every people that believe in Allah are bad people and even the revealing of Samir\\'s past shows this, who is also a firm believer in Allah. In fact I didn\\'t necessarily hate Samir or Omar, even if Omar is a real terrorist for some reason. Maybe because of his honorable ways while being courageous, although being courageous isn\\'t necessarily a good thing. So basically agent Roy Clayton investigates a dangerous international conspiracy responsible for a prison break in Yemen, a bombing in Nice and a raid in London. And all clues seem to lead back to a former U.S Special Operations officer, Samir horn. But soon contradictory evidence emerges, forcing Clayton to question whether his suspect is a disaffected former military operative or something more complicated, like the movies tagline. I was expecting some flashy fast paced spy movie but it turned out different from what I expected in that, it has some good drama to go with the action in fact the film has more drama than action. The first hour of \"Traitor\" was simply great, but after the first hour it started to lose it\\'s entertainment value and became a bit tedious. The parts after the first hour wasn\\'t bad, but just wasn\\'t good as the first hour of the film which kept me guessing. After the first hour, things start to get predictable, not that I knew what the ending was going to be or Samir\\'s last plan, but I knew what direction it is going. The stupid character decisions that jeopardize the mission got a bit irritating as well, it just seemed illogical and irrational. It was a decent espionage thriller with few glitches to sum it up.<br /><br />7.4/10',\n"," \"This is the first review I've wrote for IMDb so bare with me, but I caught this flick on HBO and was sure glad I watched it. Richard Gere is great in this film as the passionate agent/detective who bends the rules to get the job done. I think the story is great, and there's never a dull scene that slows the pace of the movie down. Some parts of the movie which have to do with demented sex addicts are pretty shocking, but if you've ever seen a crime film like Se7en, you'll be able to stomach the scenes just fine. <br /><br />So all in all, if you're looking for a good detective/suspense movie, ignore the low rating this movie got on IMDb and definitely watch it.\",\n"," \"Before seeing The Curious Case of Benjamin Button I wondered how I would react to the story of a man who is born old and gets younger as he grows up. Of all of the stories I have come across, this is by far the most bizarre and intriguing. If i had to pick someone to bring this story to the screen I do no think David Fincher would have been my first choice.<br /><br />How wrong I would have been. This film is by far one of the best if not the best of 2008. Fincher's direction is flawless! The film from start to finish does not let up. There are moments of joy and ecstasy followed by sorrow and understanding. Brad Pitt stars as Benjamin, a boy born an old man who must live his life in reverse. His friend from childhood, Daisy, is played by Cate Blanchett. The story is narrated from Benjamin's point of view with some particular highlights from Daisy.<br /><br />The cast does nothing wrong. Pitt leads with Blanchett and a strong performance from Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's surrogate mother Queenie, the only person in the world who seems to understand and truly love him from the start. Other cameos along the way bring a large array of characters, including Tilda Swinton, one of Benjamin's early love interests.<br /><br />The film spans from the end of World War I to the the arrival of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. The transitions from life stage to life stage and decade to decade are seamless. Fincher does a tremendous job at maintaining a steady flow of action and dialogue. There is not a dull moment in the film. The cinematography is superb and couples nicely with Fincher's style of accentuating certain colors to enhance a mood or moment.<br /><br />There really is nothing wrong with this film. Even with a runtime of about 160 minutes, time just flies by, much like it does for Benjamin, only we are going forward. This is a tender and meaningful film you do not want to wish.\",\n"," 'The beginning of the goddamn movie lets start there this girl is dong a half naked photo shoot and didn\\'t expect to get paid to get naked that would have bumped up my ratting if i saw some buzzugaz!! then we can go to the horrible acting \"us girls should stick together\" \"yeah us girls do need to stick together\" Me--> \"I hate my life\" seriously I wanted to put out there use a better format than mp2 cause it will jump frame rates.

Black-hole dark and beyond harrowing, it\\'s nonetheless a carefully crafted work and also extraordinarily sensitive. In fact, if it\\'s not strictly a horror film, then one can only conclude that it\\'s the genre\\'s loss. Jack Ketchum\\'s novel, like much of his work, is based on compelling real-life events. In this instance the story draws upon a 1960s case of almost unspeakable child abuse\\x97most of that abuse committed by other children under adult supervision. Ketchum, who is extremely proud of this film adaptation, speaks openly about production company Moderncine\\'s initial pitch to him: \"Let us make this movie before Hollywood does and ruins it.\" To bring The Girl Next Door to the screen, Moderncine enlisted some topnotch talent, including award-winning director Gregory Wilson, who here displays a tremendous talent working with actors, and veteran writers Philip Nutman and Daniel Farrands. Still, in a period when horror movies have repeatedly pushed, and even mangled, the envelope, this one derives most of its emotional shock not from graphic content but from the realistic and courageous presentation of a long-standing cultural taboo: on-screen violence to children. Unfortunately, it\\'s all too easy for mainstream critics to shoot down this kind of movie by terming it \"exploitative\" when actually it\\'s the opposite: a tragedy that immerses the audience in the misery of the real rather than promoting escapism with comfortable, and clichéd, lessons about violence and evil. After a successful theatrical run in New York early in the fall, The Girl Next Door is now available here on DVD. I urge you to see it. Like another powerful film released in 2007, Bug, it may hit too close to home to appeal to the typical horror fan. Indeed, it has a slightly different audience in mind: human beings.',\n"," 'It\\'s somewhat telling that most of the great reviews for the film on IMDb all come from people who have only reviewed one film in their entire IMDb career and yes you\\'ve guessed it, that film is \"Parasomnia\". I\\'ve often suspected suspiciously good reviews on IMDb for what turns out to be an anything but good films as underhand marketing , but it seems fairly transparent in this case.<br /><br />That\\'s not to say Parasomnia is terrible, but it stops well short of being the good or great film it had the potential to be.<br /><br />On the plus side, it has a great baddie in Patrick Kilpatrick who does a brilliant job projecting menacing and evil, I could easily see him having what it takes to play a truly memorable baddie on a par with Hannibal Lecter. There are some beautiful visuals in the dream sequences, in fact if the film had decided to explore that terrain more it might have been something better. The actual concept of devious misuse of hypnosis is great too.<br /><br />Although I understand suspension of disbelief is necessary for immersion in any good story, it\\'s the mark of a good story that it succeeds in letting you do that. If you find yourself being annoyed at what you find illogical or just plain silly, then the story is losing you and that\\'s what kept happening to me with this film. Other reviewers have mentioned this here and I don\\'t want to get into spoiler territory, but I will say the setup at the ending was particularly ludicrous and disappointing, not too mention the varying mental age of a character that is only supposed to have experienced a few years of life.<br /><br />All in all, there is the germ of a great idea here in diabolically misused hypnotism, but sadly this film fails to realise it into anything special.',\n"," 'As did others in this forum, when \"Fobidden Planet\" was offered in 1956, I rushed to see it. This story is an interesting phenomenon I suggest because young, old, male, female, sci-fi experts and people who find such fare \\'way out\" all can follow and enjoy this film\\'s story and plot lines very well. This is the first movie set on a planet other than Earth in the 20th Century other than serials such as \"Flash Gordon\". Leslie Nielsen was vocally a bit weak for his role, at that time, but Walter Pigeon, Marvin Miller, Anne Francis, Richard Anderson, Earl Holliman and especially Warren Stevens all acquitted themselves very well. There are so many visual splendors in this one, it\\'s hard to choose a favorite from the film\\'s scenes. The approach to Altair-4, the starship itself, the landing on the planet\\'s alien surface, the descent via extensor stairs, the first view of the landscape, the approach of the rocket-sled, Dr. Morbius\\'s house seen from without and from within, the underground complex and its wonders, the setup of the weaponry, the battle with the monster, the final approach of the unseen destroyer,the escape from the doomed planet--all these scenes are etched into the viewer\\'s mind because we discover them along with the participants. Veteran Cyril Hume\\'s literate script was filmed intelligently by long-time director Fred McLeod Wilcox with clarity and imagination. it is a shock to realize there\\'s no music at all; the film is carried by the words, the actors and the mystery-revelation storyline. It can be watched again and again with pleasure--I have been doing so for nearly fifty years. Until this famous and well-loved film was created, no film had tried to imagine a world beyond Earth; and for decades afterward, ships kept crashing back on the planet--as if the writers\\' imaginations were failing and causing the crashes. Still the best, many say. That says something negative about this nation\\'s so-called intellectual leaders\\' imaginations--and something very positive indeed I suggest about those who made this gem.',\n"," 'In yet another variation of his \"Poppy\" role from his Broadway hit of the 1920s, Fields here plays Larson E.

The son has no role.<br /><br />At the circus, among Fields\\' attraction are Edgar Bergen and his dummies. Fields and Bergen had a solid chemistry and the radio \"fued\" between Fields and the dummy Charlie McCarthy were hugely popular. Their banter here is quite funny.<br /><br />The plot is thin and revolves around the daughter\\'s marriage and the financial troubles of the circus. But it\\'s enough for Fields to build some hilarious routines around. The climactic ping pong game at the home of the groom\\'s parents is very funny. Also funny is Fields dressed up as circus star, Buffalo Bella, the sharp-shooter.<br /><br />Moore and Bergen have zero chemistry as the \"lovers.\" But good support is provided by Eddie Anderson, Mary Forbes, Thurston Hall, James Bush, Grady Sutton, and especially Jan Duggan as Miss Sludge, the woman who starts the ping pong match. Duggan memorably co-starred with Fields in THE OLD FASHIONED WAY.<br /><br />The Fields universe rarely goes well but there is a happy ending.',\n"," 'The film someone had to make.<br /><br />Waco: The Rules of Engagement dissects the evidence behind the standoff in Waco, Texas that led to the destruction of the Branch Davidian homestead and the alleged government cover-up.<br /><br />The first thing you need to know about this film: you will see brief but disturbing photos of the victims bodies. This is not done for shock value, but to illustrate points about the way they died, as if you were present at the coroner\\'s inquest.<br /><br />The second thing you should know about this film: at two and a quarter hours, it\\'s pretty ponderous - especially if you already followed the events closely at the time. If you are unaware of any of the events other than what was reported in the mass media, or if the only side of the story you are familiar with is the official government report, this may be essential viewing. If, on the other hand you want a more concise (albeit unapologetically one sided) version of events, you should see \"Waco: The Big Lie\".<br /><br />In summary, this is pretty much the definitive documentary about this tragic event, and is very sobering, but as a work of film-making, could test your patience, especially if you have a short attention span. And it\\'s at times superfluous for those who watched the CSPAN hearings and the 60 Minutes reports.<br /><br />Perhaps someday someone will make a documentary that covers some of the stranger aspects of this story, such as the bizarre chain of events that led up to the ATF raid or the psychological warfare tactics the FBI used blasting rock music at the sect, and their charismatic leaders (all rock musicians themselves) picking up their instruments and turning their massive amplifiers outward to blast their own music right back at them.',\n"," \"I wanted to give Drawing Blood the benefit of the initial doubt. The opening moments, with a naked woman sprawled out and an painter, Diana, about to paint her and then sucking her blood to drain out so she can use it for her art, give the impression that this could be a kick-ass artsy-vampire flick. Turns out this initial impression turns out false. Oh, Troma, the mark of some kind of lack of quality: sometimes they'll offer up something that is trash but funny and with at least some competence to the junk-food craft (or, sometimes not). This is a case where it's not even a whole lot of fun to watch since its attempts at humor (i.e. the protagonist's father is an old vaudevillian who does Jimmy Durante impressions?) are weak at best, and any unintentional laughs are undercut by Sergio Lapel's bargain basement direction.<br /><br />And it's not without him trying, oh Lord no. He does try a lot, which is a big part of the problem. He and his producers had money for lights, sure, but the way they're used in the movie made I, a former student filmmaker and aspiring director, sulking in my seat: if I saw this in a theater I would have to blind my eyes in many instances, and would wonder whether or not his DP understood really the basic 3-point lighting set-up. While this, along with a very lackluster sound design (or just lots of random loud humming like in the art gallery scene), shouldn't be something that comes to attention during a Troma release, it should be something *basic* that a filmmaker can tackle even if the script isn't very funny or scary (and it isn't) or if Lapel does a weird mixture of songs placed at bizarre moments.<br /><br />It's not a good movie by any stretch, and perhaps if you're a vampire die-hard (or just a vampire period) it might have some appeal as a low-rent bargain basement alternative to Near Dark, or as a slight improvement over, say, 1972's Blood Freak. You have better ways to waste your time, overall.\",\n"," \"Although the premise is interesting, this movie doesn't always carry it through well.

Her need for acceptance appears driven by a deeper need for respect, for the recognition that she is worthy of more than service as a convenient warm body. It's a heart wrenching performance, and one that I recognized to the core of me from my own club days, during the times of my life when I was so lonely that I couldn't even *fake* self-respect convincingly.<br /><br />I was torn between wanting to shake her and wanting to hold her. Her role strikes a bullseye for anyone who has ever needed a kind word and received only derision.\",\n"," \"Far more compelling than is to be reasonably expected of such teen-friendly PG13 thrillers. Of course, it lacks the wit and finesse of the original 'Rear Window', but in all honesty, 'Disturbia' really isn't trying to be a remake; it just steals the basic premise. The leads are all excellent \\x96 David Morse does his quietly chilling thing and LaBeouf really surprises with a far more complex performance than we've come to expect from such genre fodder. Sarah Roehmer is clearly the weakest link, struggling to bring any level of depth or realism to her character.<br /><br />The screenplay by Christopher Landon is packed with inexplicable and gaping plot holes \\x96 why is Kale's mother, a realtor, never at home at night? Where did all the party goers vanish to? Why did the police never check the VIN number on the neighbor's car? But such holes rarely get in the way of Caruso's expert handling of the mounting tension. As is the way with promising horror/thrillers of late, however, (remember 'Vacancy'?), a solid and suspenseful film morphs into a lazy and generic slasher movie in the final act.<br /><br />For those with an interest in such things, special note should be made of Tom Southwell, who spent the better part of twenty years as an illustrator on such movies as 'Blade Runner', 'Goonies', and 'Mission: Impossible', and here creates a beautifully detailed Craftsman home that acts as the primary location of the much of the action.\",\n"," 'Worst movie of all time?

The film claims to be based on a true story, but I'd take that with very large pinch of salt. If indeed it was based on true events then the producer/director has been a bit careless with the some of the facts.

It tries to be funny and scary and it\\'s not even close to being funny (in a good way or bad way) and it\\'s definitely not scary. The only thing scary about this woeful \"film\" is the acting. I\\'ve never seen such bad acting put on film! The acting in an Ed Wood movie is usually better than the acting in this dreck. There\\'s a scene inside the slaughterhouse, when the fat killer is above one of the businessmen and taunts the businessman with a weapon. That scene is the most pathetic example of acting I\\'ve ever seen in a film. I regretted watching this horrible film. It\\'s bad and to be avoided at all cost.',\n"," 'Young innocent Jennifer Stewart (Lucy Marlow) goes to visit her cousin Eva Phillips (Joan Crawford). She meets Eva\\'s alcoholic husband Avery (Barry Sullivan), brow beaten daughter Carol Lee (Betsy Palmer) and handyman Judson Prentice (John Ireland).

Crawford pulls out all stops and goes full force as a totally evil vicious woman. She\\'s quite obviously enjoying herself and her incredible performance saves what otherwise is a pretty routine drama. The plot is pretty predictable and all the other characters pale next to Crawford. Marlow isn\\'t that good and Sullivan and Ireland are downright terrible but Palmer was very good and seeing her so young is pretty amusing (she\\'s now best known as Jason\\'s mother from the \"Friday the 13th\" movies). Worth seeing just for Crawford alone. I don\\'t think she ever played such a cruel character before or after this one. Purportedly (according to Christina Crawford) she was playing herself!

I think that Slater is underrated as an actor, and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film. I realize this is based on a short story which I have not read. So, I do not know if what I see as the film's faults originated with the story, or were imposed on it by the director/screenwriter. The premise is wonderful, and I loved the voiceover, confessional tone the opening narration strikes. But then...? Nothing! Several of the cliched local characters ask Julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide. One could argue that he doesn't answer, because it's none of their business. But Julian is the one who, under only token pressure, blurted out his intentions in public. Then neither Julian nor the director/writer, despite the fact that the Julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for God's sake, seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on Julian's life. He says he was a bookkeeper. He says his family moved around when he was a child, due to his father's job. So what? There are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate Julian's purpose. But none of them go anywhere, because Julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet, as if he were the ultimate (and only) sane one among them. This might work as an allegory, if Julian Po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart. The closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive, religious wife of the mechanic. And what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for Julian. I can only see the Julian character --as rendered--as selfish, petty, and totally condescending. Sort of matches the attitude of the director of this half-baked, contrived film. And poor Michael Parks, an actor who once had so much promise, is given nothing to work with here.\",\n"," \"The movie wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be. I Mean i went in thinking it was going to be the worst thing ever but the cast was pretty entertaining. It was just so damn boring and there was nothing scary about it. It could have been such a better movie if they didn't do anything but talk and scream the whole damn time. And you never quite know what they are screaming about! They didn't even show how anyone died. And the ending....so what exactly happened to Carmen? Are we supposed to guess? I can't believe i even watched it to the end. I seriously fast forwarded through the scenes to actually see where it was going and it seemed like i was fast forwarding through the same thing over and over. All they did was scream and shout which was pretty annoying! And the lesbians were driving me nuts! They kept touching each other.It was so annoying. I mean don't get me wrong i have nothing against lesbians since i myself am bi, but you don't have to be touching your girlfriend every 5 secs. And it wasn't even like sexual or anything. Plus one of the girls Spanish was so thick you could hardly understand her. Not to mention the only time they didn't touch was when you wanted them to! It was a waste of time but it just irks me that this had potential if you actually had a plot.\",\n"," \"This hysterical animated short is a classic that can be enjoyed by anyone who has ever had a dog or a family or even if not, anyone who enjoys a good laugh! The animation isn't that of a top blockbuster Disney, but it's cute and the family is just odd enough to make most people feel at home. <br /><br />The main story is a small dog dealing with two kids, the kids' parents, and their overall household. When the dog is left at home after indulging in too much of Mom's new recipe while the family takes in a movie, the story gets interesting. It's a small cast of characters, but each is memorable in their own right. <br /><br />My only concern is that it's not long enough!

This is not helped by the story\\'s predictability and its lack of any intriguing, unique characters. To make matters worse, what transpires during and after the climax can be accurately guessed about twenty minutes before the film\\'s conclusion.

Maybe it's the extraordinary detail put into the game. Maybe it's the fluid movement of the characters. Maybe it's the gadgets and weapons. Maybe it's the suave character of James Bond.

In a big departure from her previous role as a femme fatale in \"Double Indemnity,\" Stanwyck displays a nice comedic flair. Morgan is smooth as the affable war hero while Greenstreet is well cast as the publisher.

It\\'s a curious plot choice to say the least, as any Aussie horror fan knows that the genre is sadly lacking in women directors. The film has a curse on it, because Molly had to kill some psycho murderer on the original set. But she\\'s back, because she needs the exposure. Unfortunately, the curse is still there and people start dying on the \"set.\" Cut is an Aussie attempt at the modern \"slasher,\" but unfortunately it doesn\\'t bring anything new or exciting to the table.

Fortunately, the film can have a sense of humor: at one point, a well-dressed girl in the movie crew says to the owner of the house they are filming at: \"Don\\'t worry, we\\'ll treat your house as if it were our own,\" to which he responds, \"that doesn\\'t mean anything to me, you look like you live in a dump!\" Ha!

The plot is virtually non- existent and the philosophies are kitchy at best, poorly delivered the rest of the time. The complete lack of anything resembling sympathetic characters doesn\\'t help the situation. There really was no growth, no forward movement at all. Even the climactic suicide scene was effectually neutered by once again refusing to let death or anything resembling reality or adult life enter in. <br /><br />Each cookie cutter figure simply goes about making you hate them in the blandest, most predictable way possible.

The Gorgeous Slut hides really soulful, deep pain with a wild lifestyle.

But many years on, I have grown to love what it is all about. In fact, I now laugh at what I guess I was so scared off. Gremlins are creatures that are meant to scare and humour the audience at the same time.<br /><br />Don't ever get it wet. Keep it away from bright light. And no matter how much it cries, no matter how much it begs...never, ever feed it after midnight. With these instructions, young Billy Peltzer takes possession of his new cuddly pet, a gift from his father. But Billy will get a whole lot more than he bargained for and the small quite town of Kingston Falls is in for a Christmas they will never forget! <br /><br />The first point I want to discuss about this movie is that of the great story behind it. It was very original and one that I liked. I enjoyed the idea of little menacing creatures causing havoc in an innocent little town, and the way that the Gremlins just take over. At the start of this film, the audience is aware that with the cute pet Gizmo (a Mogwai), comes much responsibility. I love the fact that there are three rules attached. If you break them, then all hell will break lose. It is an interesting concept and one I must say that worked. I feel that there has been some movies which have tried to copy the Gremlins concept which don't even come close. The Critters (and there sequels) for example, were a poor attempt in trying to follow on from the Gremlins.<br /><br />The human cast of Gremlins was a pretty good one. The well known person from the Gremlins for me is the gorgeous Phoebe Cates. Her character in this film is full of hurt and regret, which the audience I am sure feel sorry for, plus she also helps save the day. I recently saw her very first movie, Fast times at Ridgemont High. That was a one hell of a teenage film. Cates looked stunning in it as well. Playing the lead role of Billy Peltzer was Zach Galligan. Zach has hardly been heard of since the role of Billy in Gremlins (and the sequel). Yet I seem to ask myself the question, why? He was excellent in Gremlins and a good choice as the main character. I guess he has done some other movie which have been flops. This includes the 1994 comedy All Tied Up, starring the stunning Terri Hatcher.<br /><br />It's now time to talk about the real \\x91stars' of this show. Yes, those little green monsters. All credit needs to go to puppet makers in the Gremlins. These \\x91things' looked so real. Special comment needs to go to the creator of the \\x91Stripe' Gremlin. He was an amazing character. I want to say that the character of Gizmo was very restricted. We hardly ever see the whole animal. I liked him much more the second time around. The Gremlins is a movie that has so much happen in a little time. While these creatures remain \\x91Mogwais', they are quite harmless, but once they turn into the gruesome Gremlins they cause disaster after disaster. The scene in the school was quite satirical, with the Gremlin having his revenge on the school teacher. The only criticism of this scene is that we never actually find out what happens to that Gremlin. I guess he eventually meets up with whole group, but how does the viewing audience know this? <br /><br />Then we have the hilarious scene at the Peltzer household. The mother was quite game tackling those gruesome creatures. I love it when she blends one in the mixer and then fries one in the microwave. When Stripe escapes, he hurts the small town of Kingston Falls. The scene at the YMCA swimming pool was clever. Then when you see all the Gremlins walking into town you appreciate that they are not real. Then you have the pub scene where Kate is trapped serving all these mischievous characters, it was totally wild. Also the scene with the snow plough going through the Futterman's house was crazy and suits the Gremlins totally. By the end we see one of the great pieces of directing, seeing all the Gremlins in the cinema watching quite a tame film in Snow White. Plus the final battle between Billy and Stripe in the Supermarket. It is so clever to see the little Gremlin tackle Billy with a chainsaw and a bow and arrow. Plus we see the best scene with Gizmo here. He is driving a Barbie-doll car, which was cute. I wont describe the end, but I will say that it was quite gut wrenching.<br /><br />Credit must go to the director and producer of Gremlins. Steven Spielberg is a genius and one of the best producers in the business. His other movies which I have loved include E.T., The Goonies, and Jurassic Park. I also enjoyed the directing of Joe Dante. He was very inventive and takes us on a wild roller-coaster ride with the Gremlins. <br /><br />To say that the original Gremlins film is a favourite of mine is an understatement. This movie is full of cuteness, cleverness, mischievousness and intelligence, all rolled into one. I also remember the posters advertising the Gremlins in this country (Australia). It was a Gremlin peeking out of a toilet. When I saw that I just had to see it, even though I did get nightmares after doing so. So, if you're air conditioner goes on the fritz, or washing machine blows up, or your video recorder konks out, before you call the repairman, turn on all the lights and check under all the beds, cos you never can tell, there just might be a Gremlin in your house!<br /><br />Rating: 4 Stars or 9/10.<br /><br />\",\n"," 'This was Gene Kelly\\'s breakthrough, and that alone makes it memorable. Throw in Rita Hayworth as his love interest and comedian Phil Silvers of all people as his sidekick and you have the ingredients for a real crowd pleaser, which is exactly how it turned out.<br /><br />Kelly plays Danny McGuire, a nightclub owner in Brooklyn (Brooklyn is always the \"wrong side of the tracks\" in \\'40s films) whose star attraction and love interest is Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth). Rita is lovely, and even plays a dual role as Rusty and Rusty\\'s grandmother. Rusty has a chance at the big time through the machinations of John Coudair (Otto Kruger), who romanced and lost Rusty\\'s grandmother.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Danny cutting Rusty loose, to the detriment of his club, because she has a chance at success that he can\\'t give her. But, naturally, that\\'s not what Rusty ultimately wants, because, as usual in films of that time, the right guy is the only thing on the girl\\'s mind. There are no surprises, but everybody does their thing well.<br /><br />Kelly does the first of his amazing trick dances, this time with himself as a reflection from a glass window. He was the master at that sort of dance, and one still has to wonder how they timed everything so precisely so that he really does seem to be in two places at once. The melodrama gets a bit thick, and there are some gratuitous war references thrown in that do little but provide the opportunity for a song or two, but Kelly takes this film to the next level. This was before he became a mega-star and too smooth perhaps for his own good. An underlying edge of rawness to his character lends it a believable and almost wistful air.<br /><br />Kelly\\'s character in the 1980 \"Xanadu\" also was named Danny McGuire. This film was the beginning, that film the end, of a terrific run for a dancing genius. Clearly, this film meant a lot to him. Highly recommended.',\n"," \"Midwest married couple, George and Gwen Kellerman, chronicle their Big Apple nightmares when George races to make a job interview, and everything seems to go as wrong as possible.<br /><br />If you like Neil Simon's comedic plays and films, then this is the one to place on your 'must see' list. Actors Lemmon and Dennis each do an impeccably hilarious job. Lemmon, again, is the epitome of 'perfect timing' and has the material down pat, and Dennis is great at looking jet-lagged and harried. Neither of these actors goes too much over the top as to seem unbelievable, and (personally) their is enough credible 'couple' chemistry to support this.<br /><br />On the Remake: Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn reprised the Kellerman roles in a recent remake of the untouchable Simon original script. <br /><br />There was promise in adding to Lemmon's original 'George' portrayal, but Martin does nothing to improve on the other actors previous comedic timings, and overall portrayal of a neurotic businessman bent on getting every Manhattanite's name down so that he can later sue them for whatever inconvenience he (or his wife) has been subjected to. <br /><br />Hawn only has one notable seen in the remake (as wife 'Gwen'), when she throws her scene of furor at the police station.\",\n"," 'Should really have been called, Big Bad and Beautiful, as this is Hollywood movie-making on a grand scale with a big budget, A-list director and a starry cast producing a high quality melodrama centred on the world of movie-making itself. Unusually constructed around three separate lengthy flashbacks of past associates (a director, actress and writer, played by Barry Sullivan, Lana Turner and Dick Powell) of boy-genius Jonathan Shields (a composite, perhaps of David O Selznick and Orson Welles) played with total conviction and no little vigour by an emergent Kirk Douglas, these serve to lay bare, warts and all, his larger than life character by the conclusion, leaving the viewer to decide for themselves whether this golden boy with feet of clay is deserving of our admiration or derision. Of course we\\'re steered in the former direction not only by Douglas\\'s terrific performance but also by the clever concluding scene when Sullivan, Turner and Powell, all with ample reason to have nothing do with him, still find themselves effortlessly drawn into his comeback plans. The film is a celebration of errant genius with an appreciation that such talents are frequently flawed in character and cause casualties along the way. The acting is uniformly excellent even though Douglas\\' name should really be above Turner\\'s in the titles, given the relative scale of their parts, never mind their performances. Besides the leads mentioned above, Gloria Grahame shines again as the fey Southern belle wife of the unexciting pragmatic writer played by Powell, swept off her feet by a Latin smoothie set up by Shields. Minnelli\\'s direction is effortless, purveying numerous backstage insights on and off-camera. The story itself is highly melodramatic and improbable but nevertheless extremely entertaining and to paraphrase Bette Davis in the near contemporary classic \"All About Eve\", certainly a movie to strap in tight for, a bumpy ride is had by all.',\n"," 'Renting this video, I obviously didn\\'t think it was going to be on my top-ten-list, but all the comments on the cover fooled me a little (as so many times before). Most of the budget for this movie must have been emphasized on buying clips from other movies, such as \"Cliffhanger\" and \"Long Kiss Goodnight\". After watching these movies (among others) the directors/scriptwriters probably used some of the best scenes and built a story around it... which would later result in a totally crap-movie, with Treat Williams trying to come up with one-liners all the time. It\\'s very clear which are the clips from other films, since both the quality of the film and the actors change between scenes. However, my friend and I laughed our lungs out while watching. How can a film actually let be rented if on the cover it doesn\\'t say that it\\'s mostly a mixture of other films? Maybe we laughed o much because it was a shock.. that we weren\\'t prepared, so maybe you won\\'t laugh as much once you\\'ve read this.. but seriously, once you\\'ve seen this film you must look back and laugh at the crappy \"bear-klls-human\"-scene.',\n"," \"Ugh.

Ben & Arthur is one of the worst movies ever made. In fact, I see no reason why it should not be at #1 on the Bottom 100. For although I have not seen, for example, SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2 (#5 at the time of this publication), I would venture to guess that that film is considerably better than this oozing wound, because even in its vapid dismalness at least Baby Geniuses 2 was professionally made. By contrast, everything, and I do mean everything, in this film is completely unprofessional.<br /><br />The movie is intended to be an attack on the Christian Right\\'s supposed bigotry and hatred toward gays. And I do emphasize \"intended.\" Not only does it completely and utterly fail at its purpose, it also leaves an ugly scar. Instead of creating a compelling and realistic portrait of a gay couple\\'s struggle against a society that largely opposes them, it creates tired, crass stereotypes of each party involved. Ben and Arthur, the namesake couple, are portrayed as two crude, sex-starved, and hopelessly romantic cardboard cutouts who marry when the laws change to allow them to do so. This meets with the opposition of Ben\\'s brother Victor, a Christian minister who, like all Christians (as this movie would have us believe), is loud, prying, stupid, and violent. He tries to kill Ben and Arthur after his associations with them get him kicked out of the ministry. Just like in real life. And if you think that\\'s dreadful (it is), you haven\\'t seen it all.<br /><br />The actors (?) here manage to completely destroy any vestige of credibility in this movie by saying their lines as if they were narrating a YouTube home comedy video. But not even Daniel Day-Lewis and Marlon Brando as the title characters could have saved this clunker, for there would still be the matter of the completely inane and laugh-inducing dialogue that fills every minute of the movie. Every scene has at least one awkward or misplaced quote. For example, in one scene, Victor tries to complain about not being able to have nieces or nephews because of his brother\\'s homosexuality. But instead of portraying this idea clearly, he spits out the stupid, utterly confusing, whiny-sounding line, \"You know what, I\\'m never going to have any nieces or nephews, okay, because you\\'re so F***ED UP!\"<br /><br />Even more glaring is the complete lack of production values. Yes, I know this ain\\'t The Dark Knight, but even amateur film makers should know some basics about special effects and editing.

First off, why do so many imdbers dislike this? There are thousands, perhaps millions of movies far worse off. The acting and special fx are actually pretty good for such a low budget film. The beginning of the film has a great sense of dread. The music by Christopher Young is awesome! There is some over top emoting from the lead actors that is slightly lame, but overall a good relic from the cold war. This may be one of the more underrated Canadian sci fi movies of the 80s, although much of the plot and characterizations goes way lame in the second half. In summary, it's a good bad movie that is more good than bad.\",\n"," \"There maybe spoilers in the following; if you get to see the film, you really won't care.<br /><br />It is no wonder Asia is no longer appearing in her dad's films. She has certainly proved herself an infinitely better director all round; true, it would be hard for anyone to ever match the dizzying heights of Suspiria but this stinks. Really, it does; its a floater in the phantom's sewer. Most of the characters look like typical Eurotrash, especially the long-haired Raul, who is impossible to take seriously and WHY, Dario? WHY? WHY take away the mask? The Phantom's mask! What next? Porn without the sex? James Bond without his tux? Oi! But that isn't the half of it; we are exposed to such treats as Sands sticking rats down his trousers (yes, you read that right) and does it not worry anyone else about the amount of nudity Pop requires of Asia? But the film's crowning achievement is surely the crazy idea of Rats... yes, RATS... raising the Phantom from a baby. Where did he learn to speak? To dress? How did he come to be so good in bed? Did he read the Rata Sutra? or is it the Karma Ratra? OK, enough of that.

In no time, they\\'re joined by Bobbie Jo\\'s sweet friend Essie (Belinda Balaski, lovely and appealing as always) and sister Pearl (Merrie Lynn Ross) & Pearl\\'s boyfriend Slick (Jesse Vint), and embark on a crime spree throughout New Mexico.<br /><br />\"Bobbie Jo and the Outlaw\" is an engaging movie of its type. It\\'s spirited, breezy and sleazy stuff. Director Mark L. Lester knows his audience, and delivers the enjoyable staples of the genre. The bountiful T & A is a prime visual asset, the action scenes are swift, the pace never lets up much, and the flavorful score by Barry DeVorzon really hits the spot.<br /><br />The cast is quite entertaining right down the line. It also includes appearances by John Durren as Deputy Abel Gance, Peggy Stewart as Bobbie Jo and Pearl\\'s alcoholic mother Hattie, Gerrit Graham as commune leader Magic Ray, James Gammon as a leather salesman, Gene Drew as redneck Sheriff Hicks, Virgil Frye as Joe Grant, who makes the mistake of challenging Lyle on his quick-draw abilities, and future director Chuck Russell (also second assistant director here) as an unnamed deputy.

They never reach their destination as they decide to pull over at the Rest Stop.<br /><br />After a fight with her boyfriend, Nicole Carrow insists on pulling in to a rest stop. When she is ready to leave, she exits the bathroom to find her boyfriend has disappeared with their car, leaving her trapped on the back roads of Texas with only an abandoned camper van to keep her company.<br /><br />Rest Stop is one of those cheap and tacky horror movies that could become a cult classic. Will Rest Stop become a cult classic you may ask? Well the three elements that you need to become a cult classic are gore, sex and artistic merit. Rest stop has bucket loads of gore, and while I do not want to give too much away, it contains oodles of blood-soaked nastiness. This movie has everything from the bad guy running over a cop's legs with his car several times to him making use of a pneumatic drill on a girl's leg. At times, it can be about as bloody as a film can get. It also has a gratuitous and yet somehow quite intimate love scene in the opening minutes of the film. Therefore, the sex is covered. Now the hard one \\x96 does it have any artistic merit? You never get to see the bad guy's face \\x96 you see glimpses, profiles, shadowy silhouettes. He is a faceless, relentless, monster, which alone scores highly on the artistic merit scale. The movie has very few characters in it apart from the main protagonist \\x96 Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander). Since she spends a large part of the film on her own, she cannot reveal her thoughts in the course of a conversation, but must speak them aloud so that we, the audience, know what she is thinking. At times, this can be slightly irritating; however, it is a brave step by the writer (John Shiban) and it does work for the majority of the film. As an audience knows, being completely alone and isolated from civilisation is frightening enough even when you are not being chased by psychotic killers.<br /><br />So, will Rest Stop become a cult classic? It probably will because along the gore, sex and arguable artistic merit, it also has plenty of chills, an interesting and inventive plot and gives rise to a lot of shouting at the screen as the main character does plenty of things you should definitely not do when running from a psychotic killer. (What fun are horror movies if you cannot complain about the stupidity of the victims?)\",\n"," \"3 Deewarein is a mystery unfolding. What attracts this woman to probe into the lives of these three men? What lies within them? Whatever is apparent at the onset may not be so. It is easy to become wrapped up in their lives as you watch this film, with a growing concern for each of the convicts. The writer and director did a superb job of creating all these questions, making you wonder throughout what everyone's goal is. The acting is top notch, every single performer, major and minor, suits their role. Each personal life is examined, past and present. Supporting cast in the form of prisoners and guards are also extremely well developed and integrated into the story. Nothing happens without a reason, everything is intertwined. A well done gem of a film that breaks away from the standard Bollywood fare.\",\n"," \"Thank God that there are films out there that don't follow the same old Hollywood crap formula. I think the digital revolution and the DVD revolution is actually making it possible for more interesting work to get out there even if you have to dig harder to find it. I love it when a film takes its time to draw you in deeper and deeper into its inner emotional reaches. It really was like taking a trip through the soul of America and that soul is disturbed and confused. What really blew my mind was the way they used Martin Luther King's speeches about Vietnam and references to his assassination in a way that hit me hard. I found myself choked up every time i heard his voice. I've heard him speak before, of course, but the way they used the speeches here made me feel like I understood his message in a way I'd never thought about.<br /><br />What can you say about a movie that has heavy statistics about war, oppression and a plea for compassion at the end of it where a credits crawl would usually be? In fact, there's no credits at all in the film. You have to access them by selecting them in the features. Somehow that made me think a lot. All in all I can't say enough about this DVD. Brilliant.\",\n"," 'Consistency is perhaps this movie its biggest problem. The movie starts of as a fast, stylish and just plain fun political satire but in its second halve the movie gets more serious of tone, in an almost Oliver Stone kind of way. It\\'s of course also a very serious subject but I would say that the movie would had been way better and also more effective if it had been completely done in the same style as the first halve of the movie got shot in.<br /><br />For a biography and a movie concerning the subject of this movie, the movie is also quite short with its mere 102 minutes of running time. The movie because of this feels like it isn\\'t telling the whole story. Of course the following up of the events after the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan gets hinted at in the movie but the movie doesn\\'t go deeper into it and it doesn\\'t explain much about it, which feels like a cheap way to just glorify Charlie Wilson, without showing the other side of the medal. Also the actual events in the movie itself gets rather simplified, even though the story still gets told (needlessly) complex at times.<br /><br />Yes, the movie would just had been way better if it was not trying to be so serious at times and overall more light with its style and atmosphere. The movie should had been for instance more like \"Wag the Dog\", that achieved to find a right combination of satire and sensitive political issues.<br /><br />Because of this incoherent style and way of storytelling, the acting performances are also mixed. When Tom Hanks is playing his character more playfully and in a more comical kind of way he\\'s just excellent. But this just makes it sort of hard to take his character serious in the more serious and sensitive/shocking moments of the movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman is always excellent though, as he is in any movie that he plays in. He also received an Oscar nomination for his role in this movie. Most of the other actors just seem to walk around in this movie, just to be in the movie. This goes mostly for Julia Roberts, whose character I found just too mysterious to seem to have a clear enough purpose for the movie. She made a redundant impression on me and is therefor also really forgettable in this movie.<br /><br />It\\'s not that the movie is a bad watch, it actually is quite good and also enjoyable but if the movie would had dared to be a bit more edgier the movie would had been a better and foremost also more effective one at what it tried to obviously achieve.<br /><br />7/10',\n"," \"This film reminded me of The Sopranos, and not in a good way. <br /><br />David Chase's seminal mob opera only ever put its foot wrong twice, the most jarring and inexplicable instance of which took place in its fourth season, when Junior Soprano went on trial for his life. Rather than pursue this riveting (and pivotal) plot line, the writers instead chose to completely ignore it, focusing instead on Bobby Baccalieri's constant whimpering over his recently deceased wife's frozen pasta dish. <br /><br />When something of genuine interest happens in Notorious - for example that first, mysterious assassination attempt on Tupac Shakur that ignited the whole East Coast/West Coast feud in the first place, and ended up leading to the deaths of both Tupac and Christopher Wallace - the film treats it as just another bit of plot to plod through. Why exactly was Tupac so convinced that he was sold out by his own people? Did he alone nurture his subsequent affiliation with Suge Knight? And was Lil' Kim's transformation from prim office drone into sex-obsessed, vampish diva really as banal as it appears here?<br /><br />None of these questions are even fleetingly addressed by the film's screenwriters, who are far more interested in depicting Wallace's turbulent love life to zero compelling dramatic avail. These sequences (including a brain-frazzlingly clichéd groupie indescretion in a hotel room) are so toothless and bruisingly manipulative that the only real comparison to be made is with a network TV movie.<br /><br />The storytelling, in both structure and content, is simplistic and trite. But more fundamentally, as a biopic; as something designed to celebrate its subject and educate the uninitiated on the intricacies of their life and work; the film is almost entirely worthless. The reliance on meat-and-potatoes genre plotting, coupled with the lifeless musical performances (an area in which a film like this should soar, surely) result in a film that appears to have been designed only to satisfy the whims and demands of those involved, leaving Wallace's questionable status as a giant in his field as the preserve of the easily persuaded and previously converted only. <br /><br />And the final twenty minutes, in which Wallace's posthumous cultural identity is broadly painted as being akin to that of a latter day saint, quite frankly made me feel like throwing up. <br /><br />On that score, much as with any other, Notorious is crass, calculating and compromised.\",\n"," '\"Asylum\" isn\\'t actually offensive or incompetent, so I couldn\\'t give it a single star. In fact, the film is shot fairly well (if you like dark scenes where you can\\'t tell what\\'s going on) and the direction is acceptable. The acting varies wildly, but is certainly a step up from most of the horror trash being churned out these days. The SFX range from pretty scary and subtle to just plain laughable (see the last scene, for example.) <br /><br />What really makes this film a bore is the lousy plot and script. It truly does play like it was filmed from a script assembled by throwing the scripts from classic horror movies (and some that aren\\'t so classic) up in the air and then picking up random pages after they fall. Not every horror film cliché appears in this film, but there are no scenes in this film that are not horror clichés. The dialogue is just totally unrealistic. No suspense...no character development...no logic.<br /><br />So who\\'s fault is this big mess? I\\'ve got to pick on the director. He had to have seen what he was working with. It\\'s possible to film a decent story from a weak script, but he apparently decided not to put forth the effort. The result is, to use a cliché, \"cliche-ridden.\"<br /><br />Final recommendation...you probably won\\'t hate it or throw beer cans at the screen, but it\\'s not going to surprise you or scare you. I\\'d suggest avoiding this film.',\n"," \"I saw this DVD in my friends house and thought that this was a Turkish action movie with some Hollywood-not very big-names in it.

I checked some names and no, they were not Turkish names and no, this was not a Turkish movie; on the contrary it was literally shot in America with an American director & crew! That made me thinking-again!- How on earth can you persuade names like Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to take part in such a project? with money probably.. That kept me thinking further.. How can you raise such amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast? Then all my meditation paid off and I came to find the answer.By hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find.

But, sad to relate, nothing worth talking about (let alone making a movie about) has happened to either of them in the intervening years. So, instead, the script contents itself with throwing out one hoary old plot device after another (most having to do with older women in the workplace), while completely missing the quirky charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner. The supporting cast is instantly forgettable, the humor is nonexistent, and the chemistry which Moore and Harper once had together is gone. Moore allegedly stalled this project for years, waiting for \"just the right script\" before committing herself. If this was the one she considered \"right\", what on earth were the ones she turned down like? It\\'s not the age of the characters that does this in (for time inevitably marches on), but the almost complete lack of imagination coupled with a blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work.

The most self-consciously \"arty\" of my friends and acquaintances have a better grasp of basic technology than the writers involved in this turkey.

This isn\\'t all that unusual because Cagney frequently played lawmen--such as an OSS leader (the forefather of the CIA) of FBI agent.

There were Mao statutes everywhere, and I was told that if you did take a photo with one of them in the background and cut of his head in the picture, that you could be punished or even killed.

My girlfriend and I had just finished watching John Hurt in Michael Radford’s Nineteen Eighty-Four and I put this documentary on because I thought a nice short colorful coral reef film might be nice after such a grey depressing movie.

Look no matter how you feel about global warming the villain in this piece was clearly those nice Fijians who were logging and overfishing and killed their own damn reef. The movie clearly shows this and then completely ignores its own findings to declare global warming the boogey man (Though in this particular case it was obviously innocent. As local reefs not near the GIANT SILT RUNNOFF and not located IN THE FISHING GROUNDS were thriving.) But the Fijians can’t be guilty of course cause the look so cute in their Sunday best and they have quite a haunting rendition of Marrakesh Express. Such propaganda, no matter how well intentioned, needs to be called to the carpet. In particular when it is aimed towards children.<br /><br />The film has other faults as well. It is over produced by half with wipes and sound effects that look like they belong in a Disney Ducktales movie.

It was nice seeing a seasoned, rugged looking actor in this role after sitting through movie after movie with the fair haired, fair skinned actors like Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, etc. He was an excellent choice and I enjoyed every minute of this movie. This version cannot be compared with the 1950's version with Stewart Grainger. It was a big screen movie and not a made for TV movie.

The director though seems to be deliberately trying to confuse the audience by using flashbacks and dream sequences. By the finale, there are too many unanswered questions. What's worse, as the story is so confusing, it's pretty hard to root for any of the characters.

At the start of this film, Wally has an African-American named Ernest Jones (Troy Brown Jr.) pretend to be \"the Sultan of Marzepan\" a wealthy far eastern potentate who is planning to donate millions to build some kind of multi-cultural center in Manhattan*. At the last moment his wife shows up with their children (the wife is Hattie MacDaniel), and she wrecks the hoax just as Connolly is taking credit for the donation for his newspaper. <br /><br />*Oddly enough there has recently been a two part news item in the New York Times about the plans (in Abu Dhabi) for a cultural center and university on a large scale.

Wally is first banished to the obituary column of the paper (Ernest is given a janitorial job - this film is from the 1930s, by the way, so some stereotyping is going to be here). After a month Wally begs for a chance to resume his old job. Oliver, somewhat reluctantly, ends up giving Wally a scoop to interview a young woman in a New England town named Hazel Flagg (Carole Lombard). Hazel worked in one of those factories where they used radium based paint on watches, so she has been diagnosed by the local doctor (Enoch Downer - Charles Winninger) as dying of radium poisoning. <br /><br />Wally goes to the town of Warsaw, and finds the natives nosy, secretive, and hostile (one little kid even bites Wally on the leg). He finds Hazel and makes the offer that Oliver has for her - if she will come to New York City, the newspaper will give her first rate hotel accommodations, fine dining, take to all the sites, and have the city lay out the official red carpet to her - until the day she dies. Hazel gleefully accepts - she hates being stuck in her town. Of course she fails to mention that Dr. Downer (who is a heavy drinker) botched up her test, and the lab has now revealed that she is healthy as a horse and will not die. She takes Downer with her and Wally to make sure he keeps quiet.<br /><br />The film then follows her rise to international celebrity trumpeted by Oliver\\'s newspaper, the Mayor\\'s office, and other interested parties. She is invited to all sorts of events (when she attends a wrestling match, the two wrestlers - supposedly killing each other - stop to greet her with smiles). A collapse at a nightclub (due to drinking too much) is mistaken for an early sign of her mortal illness (sentimental Oliver begs Dr. Downer not to spare him the worst - the next edition is going out in half an hour!). In the meantime Hazel and Wally have fallen in love - but Hazel does not know how to break the bad news to Wally: that she may live to a fine old age!<br /><br />Many of the screwball comedies of the 1930s don\\'t work so well today, due to changes in our perspectives.

However, The Cavern chooses instead to introduce elements that work at first, only to be negated by it\\'s own lackluster storytelling.<br /><br />All the characters are completely forgettable and any actual back story that might make any of them even remotely interesting is blurted out within a 30 second monologue, making it impossible to do anything more than laugh as characters are picked off almost at random and on more than one occasion in the least possibly frightening way.<br /><br />(To spoil a scene a bit, one victim is taken during a complete blackout which might have been a little frightening if the sound effect used to indicate his killing wasn\\'t reminiscent of stirring a pot of too thick Macaroni and Cheese) Add to this formula the camera that work makes me think the director saw one too many Nine Inch Nails videos and an ending which in an attempt to be shocking serves almost no purpose but to annoy and confuse the viewer and you have an almost completely unwatchable horror film that fails on every level.<br /><br />I\\'ll be honest with you, if you want a claustrophobic caving horror movie go watch \"The Descent\", and I feel weird saying that because I didn\\'t particularly enjoy that movie either.',\n"," 'There was a time when my best friend and I, as teenagers, decided to see every single film that a local second-run multiplex carried.

Whatever originality exists in this film -- unusual domestic setting for a musical, lots of fantasy, some animation -- is more than offset by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thought-provoking plot development. Individually, June Haver and Dan Dailey appear to be nice people, but can't carry a movie as a team. Neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal. They're both bland.

I read the book before, and I found the BBC production dealing with this difficulty in the best way possible. The qualities of the book haven't been lost: the dense and lively depiction of a fingersmith patchwork family in London in the 1860s, the cold and obscene cruelty in which Maud is brought up, the characterization of different social groups by different ways of speaking, the unexpected and surprising twists of the story, the way the film makes the spectators look different at the same scenes when they are told first from Sue's point of view then from Maud's one. The main actors do very good, and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed, with a first culmination in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and did to each other, because they still love each other.<br /><br />For each of her books the author, Sarah Waters, has thoroughly investigated what life was like in British 19th century. While in Tipping the Velvet it was the world of the vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements, in Affinity the dreadful reality of women penitentiaries and the fashionable evocation of spirits, in Fingersmith she depicts the public ceremony of hanging people in London and the inhuman treatment of persons supposed or declared disturbed in asylums based on the reading of sources and scientific research. This is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high grade of historic truth. I highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful Victorian atmosphere, vivid emotions, and suspense.\",\n"," 'According to the movie slang, a \"slide\" is a guy so dumb he even has no idea he\\'s being framed on.

Whereas Cube was taut, well-made, claustrophobic and mind-engaging, I'm afraid Cypher is a bloated, tedious rehash of several well-worn themes which just don't add up to much, especially if you have seen almost any other half-way decent sci-fi film before.<br /><br />Cypher manages to drag all the way through its relatively short 95 minutes right to the incompetent ending. None of the characters spark off each other, and for a film made in 2002 the technology is truly cheesy. It is difficult to connect this tired and uninspired movie with the director of Cube.

It represents a rare and earnest attempt to bring to the silver screen a true story of ultimate gambling compulsion. The complete obsession that annihilates any proximity of spirituality and nullifies any chance of redemption. This is the least likely movie a Vegas Casino executive would recommend. And it is the sole poker DVD you are likely to find on the shelves of Gamblers Annonymous.<br /><br />There are scenes in this movie that poker buffs are sure to refer to as some of the best gambling scenes ever. Stu reading his opponent's hand and, particularly, a Texas hold'em bluffing scene.<br /><br />Prophetically, early on in the movie we see a young Stu bullied out of his pocket change by a bunch of neighborhood hoodlums. Poker is for loners seeking revenge. It is a game of patience which bullies lack. 'You can't bully me!' may very well be an underlying sentiment of the punishing force that a champion poker player unleashes upon his adversaries.<br /><br />Conservatives will look upon this film as a cautionary tale of a soul lost in sin. They may evoke Mark Twain: 'The best throw at dice is to throw them away.' The young and liberal masses will inevitably have a more simplistic and sympathetic outlook. They may not have heard of Twain's quote, but will sure remember a remark made by Stu's stunned pal who learns from up-and-coming Stuey that he'd won a car from a local character in an overnight game. 'You tell'em to go to hell and they look forward to the trip'.<br /><br />The mosaic of Las Vegas vignettes that we see in STUEY will long linger in memory. Frank Sinatra, the most generous tipper? Forget about it! Nobody tips as extravagantly as a hot-shot gambler. And for Vegas visitors who may not know the impact of tipping on the quality of their stay, check out the scene of Stu checking in a Vegas hotel!<br /><br />'This is what i was meant to do, this is where i was to be.

This movie despite being based on the experiences of an elite US naval frog team at war is surprisingly value-neutral when it comes to extolling the virtues of the US military, or even the reasons for going to war. This may have to do with the fact that the writer/director, Shimon Dotan, is an Israeli. In short, I enjoyed this movie, because it introduces some character development in a genre where it is often conspicuously absent. The casting of Rob Lowe as the career jackass was a stroke of genius! That said, there are aspects of honour and sacrifice inherent in his role, which he does bring out. However, like others I felt Gale Hansen stole the show with his role as the strong-willed and dependable leader contrasting with Lowe's as the antithesis. I like the fact that everything didn't work out at the end, and the monologue delivered at the end summed up the whole experience nicely. Go see it.\",\n"," 'I was very impressed with this film. I would have to rate it as one of the better classic-era westerns. I say that for the whole thing: the acting, mature dialog, no- nonsense story and excellent cinematography.<br /><br />Director Anthony Mann, who did several well-photographed film noirs around this same era, also made some westerns such as this one. It has that same film-noir look. Mann and Jimmy Stewart collaborated on several westerns during this period. . If you like this movie, I recommend the Mann-Stewart film \"Bend Of The River.\"<br /><br />In a nutshell, the story is about a man, \"Lin McAdam,\" (Stewart) who owns this prestigious Winchester 73 rifle, a weapon he won fair-and-square in a contest. It is then stolen and passed on from villain to villain. All of those villains are interesting characters.<br /><br />Aiding Stewart act out this interesting tale are Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Greer and J.

That plot in itself reeks of clichés and promises of boredom when on as small a scale a film as this, and that\\'s exactly what you get.<br /><br />First off let me say that I by no means dismiss films because they are B movies, in fact some of my favourite films are B movies such as Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter, but this one misses the mark by a mile.<br /><br />Anyone with any knowledge of small budget films will know that the acting is rarely gripping and emotional, but Razor Blade Smile creates a whole new dimension of hamming it up on screen. Some of the so called acting is just indescribably bad, with characters spewing cheesy one liners that fall flat, and discourse expressing about as much emotion and conviction as the terminator after a couple of horse tranquillisers.<br /><br />A vast portion of the film is also taken up by the vampiric characters, the protagonist in particular, unnecessarily flapping their mouths, showing off their ridiculously large vampire teeth and exhaling very loudly. It literally must happen in almost every scene at least once, and quickly became annoying and pointless, as if that many looks of slack jawed supposedly scary vampire faces were used to merely fill a little bit of time and pad out the rest of this turd sandwich of a film.<br /><br />Contrary to what some of the other reviewers believe on here, I feel this film (the director in particular) is really trying to take this film seriously in many parts. The sheer number of overly dramatic action shots and extreme close-ups seems to indicate to me that the director really wanted people to feel this film and make it legitimate to its genre and not spoof it, and he fails miserably. The attempts at supposedly tasteful sex scenes come out as comic and silly and the action sequences are sometimes just plain stupid.<br /><br />Also the ending of this film was one of the weakest and most pathetic conclusions I have seen to a film, B movie or not. When films such as this force you to sit through hours of themselves only to be rewarded with a \"oh it was all a game\" ending it is actually sickening. It the conclusion to the \"plot\" feels like an afterthought of the director that he figured out on the last day of shooting because they had run to the end of their shoestring budget.<br /><br />But I have not rated this film as one star despite the overwhelming crappiness, and this is because of the only plus point I can really give this film. Intentionally or not, it was funny. I am fairly sure the parts I found humorous were not intended to be, and I found most of the efforts at genuine gags to be fruitless, but when watched with friends it is a good film to take the mickey out of.',\n"," 'Very touching film, a great surprise to come up from Brazil, a country that usually exports features about social themes, violence, sex...

Claire Grogan, as Dorothy\\'s classmate Susan, is arguably the best of the lot and together with Sinclair, were the only two main actors in this to go on to do anything else afterwards. If you\\'re not used to Scottish accents then you may find some of the dialogue passing you by but in truth, you get used to it. But then again, my fiancée is Scottish so I probably have something of a head start! <br /><br />It does take a while to get going and the ending does feel slightly rushed but \"Gregory\\'s Girl\" is a movie worth watching. Feeling every inch like the tortured, angst-ridden romance that it should be, it\\'s just so good to see a film that actually recreates the terror and fear that is associated with one\\'s first love as opposed to overly sanitised teen love stories like \"10 Things I Hate About You\" or \"Clueless\". It\\'s also good to see a Scottish film that has nothing to do with drugs and \"murdur\" and is instead a light-hearted comedy. Having never seen \"Gregory\\'s Girl\" before yesterday, I couldn\\'t quite work out why it was held in such high regard but there is no denying that there is something special about this movie. Make sure you get the full DVD version and not the freebie from the paper - no subtitles!',\n"," 'A broke would be screenwriter and his would be agent (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) are forced to live in a self storage facility run by an eccentric and intimidating manager (Ron Perlman) whom they come to believe is the serial murderer that is terrorizing the city, the \"Costume Killer\" (so named because, after injecting his victims with Windex, he dresses them in silly costumes). They convince him his life story would make a great film and gather together a group of misfit wannabe film makers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson) and discover that the art of movie making can be murder.<br /><br />There is more to this movie but it was unfortunately left on the editing room floor and it shows (rumor is the studio wanted a \"lighter\" dark comedy). Our loss (and the actors, who all do fine jobs and deserve better) as this has the makings of an exceptional black comedy but only rises to mediocre cute.<br /><br />If you\\'re a Ron Perlman fan this is absolutely worth getting just for his performance. His comedic timing is excellent and he has the chance to do some really great impressions (he wasn\\'t kidding when he said on the Hellboy movie commentary that he needed an intervention when he gets into Jerry Lewis mode). He\\'s just simply fun to watch in this one. <br /><br />David Dukes also shines in a two-scener (but pivotal) role.',\n"," \"This incredible movie tells the story of Germany's slide towards Nazi rule in the late 1920s or early 30s. The world of pre-WWII Berlin is seen through the distorted mirror of the Kit Kat Night Club. While technically a musical, the movie does not use the contrivance of having people stop in the middle of a scene and burst out in song and dance. Rather, the songs and danges are integrated into the plot either by being performed on the Cabaret stage or in some other natural manner--including the bone-chilling Tomorrow Belongs to Me. Unlike most movies of the time (including the vastly overrated Godfather), director Bob Fosse does not keep the action entirely linear; rather event A will happen in scene 1, you then have scene 2 dealing with an unrelated issue, then the consequence of event A will be played out in scene 3. This lets the viewer draw his own connections, rather than having everything spoon-fed by the moviemaker. While the Godfather un-deservedly got Best Picture for 1973, it got a total of only 3 Oscars, while Cabaret got 8 (including Best Director)--making it the movie to have gotten the most Oscars without also getting Best Picture. It surely should have--in 1973 or just about any other year.\",\n"," 'The idea for the movie wasn\\'t too bad: a horror film shot in a corn maze on Halloween.

Oh, I\\'m sorry, the \"maize.\" I picked up this movie because it reminded me of a corn maze near where I live, and I thought it was a cool idea for a movie. But taking everything into consideration, it seems that your average Joe could take the same idea and run much further with it. Bill Cowell\\'s acting wasn\\'t too bad, in fact, I would say it was pretty good. But the lack of talent from his co-stars didn\\'t help his efforts.

I enjoyed Saawariya for its simple tale of unrequited young love. The emphasis on \"unrequited\" and \"young\" sets this film apart. It\\'s the type of film that takes time to understand, not of the instant gratification variety other than the opulent sets and slick cinematography. (Ravi K Chandran should already have a few lifetime achievement awards at his relatively young age.) You feel a bit of a void after it is over - my wife thought it was depressing at first - but once you discuss the characters\\' motivations and the ending, it all seems justified. The two new leads are very good, but not what I\\'d term instant stars or acting legends. The star of the movie is unequivocally RANI MUKHERJEE. She gives layers and nuances to the Gulabji character that were sorely missing in her recent Laaga Cinema Mein Boredom.',\n"," \"The Breed starts sometime in '...The Near Future...' where homicide detective Steven Grant (Bokeem Woodbine) & his partner Phil (Reed Diamond) follow up a lead on a particularly nasty serial killer who's running around at the moment. The lead happens to be a stolen van which they find & in a nearby building discover yet another dead body. The mysterious killer is also there, he most definitely resists arrest & even though Grant repeatedly shoots him he kills Phil by biting his neck. Grant survives but the killer disappears into the night... The 'National Security Agency' contacts Grant about the incident, the agencies director says that what he, & Phil, were dealing with was a renegade Vampire. He carries on to inform Grant that there are about 4000 Vampires worldwide & they revealed themselves to 'us' to try & live in harmony together, he also says that Vampires are genetic mutations & feed on a synthetic substitute for blood. Grant is assigned a new partner, a Vampire named Aaron Gray (Adrian Paul) & they are told to work together to discover the identity of the serial killing Vampire who wants to sabotage the peace between the two races...<br /><br />This American Hungarian co-production was directed by Michael Oblowitz & is average at best. The script by Christos N. Gage & Ruth Fletcher is the real problem here. Too many things just didn't work for me, for a start could a high ranking scientist create a virus that has the potential to wipe out the entire human race without a SINGLE person questioning him or finding out? I mean the guy is even using the 'Nation Security Agency' laboratories for Christ's sake! Considering the Vampire race has been around for 1000's of years it seemed strange that there was only 4000 throughout the entire world & that they had never been noticed before. The central relationship between Grant the human & Gray the Vampire was clichéd & really cheesy, I mean at first they don't don't get on & seem mismatched but by the end they are best of friends & have saved each other's lives, we've seen it all before & done a lot better. The whole story is predictable & I can't believe it took Gray over half the film to figure out the painfully obvious. The whole concept just didn't work as far as I'm concerned & the film spent a good 30 minutes explaining it's own set of Vampire 'rules' as Grant would ask a question like how to kill a Vampire & Gray would tell him thus making sure we, the viewer that is, know as well. The breed also makes a few feeble attempts to say things about racism, trust & acceptance, you know all the clichéd things one would expect.<br /><br />Director Oblowitz thinks he's making a cross between The Matrix (1999), Lethal Weapon (1987) & Vampires (1998), well no-one told him that you need a budget to pull that off. He films the fight scenes with people 'flying' through the air plus shooting & reloading their guns in a 'cool' way but they come off as looking ridiculous. He films everything with bleached out colours & a greenish tint. As for the films supposed style, you need to do a bit more than tilt the camera, shine a few neon lights & have some mist swirling in every shot. The gore is none existent, one neck biting, a couple of slit throats, a few gunshot wounds & someone explodes CGI style at the end & it looks terrible.<br /><br />With a really low budget of about $400,000 it shows. The Breed has reasonable production values but it looks cheap throughout & you can tell it was shot in Europe, in this case Hungary. Even though it is meant to be set in the future the cars, clothes & the like suggest otherwise. I found the acting awful, whats with the gay moustache Paul? Woodbine gives a terrible performance & just wasn't right for the role at all. Ling Bai is quite sexy looking whenever she appears.<br /><br />I was disappointed by The Breed, it's one of those films that make a fantastic trailer when they show ALL the cool bits in the space of two & a half minutes set against some techno music. Unfortunately there's another eighty seven & a half minutes to sit through if you decide to watch it. Personally I didn't think much of it.\",\n"," \"OK, so obviously ppl thought this was a good movie in 1955.<br /><br />I pity the fools who still think so... Its absolute rubbish.<br /><br />The story is just ... ridiculous. The characters are absurd caricatures - but this film is not meant to satirise, im sure its meant to be a serious drama isn't it?<br /><br />Dean and others, are too old for their parts. People say Dean is great in this film, and well, maybe he did play his part as well as he possibly could've. His character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so. But Dean was a 24 year old man when he made this film. Seeing him agonise and throw little tantrums like a 4 year old boy... its pathetic.<br /><br />Natalie Wood is gorgeous, but the early scenes at the police station where she is crying and whining are very unconvincing. It sets a bad precedent for the film... and for the rest of it, you feel like cringing every time one of these badly acted emotional scenes comes along.<br /><br />It may've been good for its time, but, really, its drivel.<br /><br />It must've just been hype about Dean's death that has over-inflated the reputation of this film.\",\n"," 'If my memory is correct, when this movie was released it came across as something of a comedy - a funny look at the adult entertainment industry. If that\\'s what it\\'s supposed to be, it doesn\\'t really work. It just isn\\'t that funny. Setting that rather significant (since this is called a comedy!) failure aside, since I have no personal knowledge of the subject matter, I\\'ll avoid comment about the authenticity of the story - which deals with the goings on behind the scenes in a Toronto massage parlour, except to say that - if this is true - the life is pretty dull. <br /><br />For over an hour, this movie really doesn\\'t give us much of anything except some background knowledge of the main characters. Conrad is the newly hired manager of the massage parlour whose basic job apparently is to make sure the girls aren\\'t giving \"full service\" - a euphemism for actual sex. As for the girls themselves, Betty\\'s goal is to buy a parlour of her own so that she can run her own business, Cindy is an illegal immigrant to Canada working to support her family back home and Leah is - well, Leah is a somewhat strange, undefined character with a nipple fetish - true - who seems to be in the business because - well, because she\\'s in it! I have no idea what her character was about. Those three may well fairly reasonable composite characters who accurately represent the motivations of the women who get involved in this business.<br /><br />The movie meanders about and doesn\\'t offer much until the \"twist\" reveals Conrad to be the bad guy. We should have gotten to that point sooner. The only thing truly interesting here was that part of the story - Conrad\\'s secret plan and the revenge plotted against him by the girls. That plan for revenge was pretty good, and you\\'re grateful when it comes out because basically up to that point you\\'re wondering why you wasted your time with this. Had the story been more focused on the revenge, this might have actually been a fairly funny movie.<br /><br />The performances from the 4 leads were all OK, although I didn\\'t think anyone came across as outstanding. All four characters were a bit shallow. Cindy was a sympathetic character, and so was Conrad for a while, although he turns out to be the bad guy of the movie. Given the subject matter, there\\'s surprisingly little nudity (and what there is is restricted to one scene.) In fact, there even a certain air of innocence around a lot of this. As for the overall quality of the movie, it\\'s a low-budget effort, which shows, although you expect a certain griminess, I suppose, of a movie set in the context of a body rub parlour, so that\\'s forgivable. It certainly says something, though, that this was released 8 years ago now and is still the only credit on writer-director Soo Lyu\\'s resume and - given the normal lack of depth in the Canadian film industry - that it wasn\\'t even deemed worthy of being nominated for any Genie Awards - the Canadian version of the Oscars. 4/10 - and I\\'m being a bit generous with that.',\n"," 'Antonioni\\'s movies have aged not well. What always surprised me about them is that, besides an unquestionable plastic beauty, there is a dull and didactic \"psychology\" of the characters and situations. Remember, for instance, the conversations between Mastroianni and the \"wicked capitalistic\" that wants sing up him in \"La notte\", or Monica Vitti laughing at the peasants flirting in the train in \"La aventura\", or Ferzetti dropping the glass of ink at the end of the same film. <br /><br />I have reviewed yesterday \"Zabriskie Point\". In this film there are a lot of nice and elaborate shots of the Rod Taylor office, the streets and highways of L.A., the publicity advertisements, the deserts,etc., that show the fascination of the author in his American journey, in the same way than Wim Wenders years later. Unfortunately, there are too a lot of hippie-leftist clichés that spoil the movie: - The boy leaves the meeting, steals an aeroplane and flies over the desert in order to liberate himself and find \"something different\". - The executives in grey suites speak all the time about speculation. - The girl looks at the \"object women\" in the swimming pool and leaves because she wants not to be like them. - The couple of fat middle-class in the caravan speak, in front of the beauty of the nature, of building a hotel and earning a lot of money. - Last but not the least, a lot of couples making love in the desert. What a hippie platitude!<br /><br />Sorry, today, half a century after the \"revolution\" of \"La Aventura\" we can see that the king is naked, and his films (except \"Le amiche\" and perhaps \"Il grido\") are only a handful of aestheticism and commonplaces.',\n"," \"This was a very entertaining movie and I really enjoyed it, I don't normally rent movies like these (ie. indie flicks) however, I was attracted to the film because it had an incredible cast which included Jamie Kennedy, whom I have loved since the Scream trilogy. The movie director took a risk (and it is a risky risk) in telling the lives of many (and I mean MANY) different people and having the intertwine at various intervals. Taking that risk was a good idea because it's end result is an exceedingly good film. <br /><br />The film has a few MAIN characters; Dwight (Jamie Kennedy) - a disgruntled fortune cookie writer whose relationship with his girlfriend is on the rocks because of an argument. Wallace Gregory (John Carroll Lynch) - an airplane loader/technician who has a love for all living things (except, perhaps meter maids) and who despite his good heart has an increasing amount of bad luck. Cyr (Brian Cox) - the owner of a Chinese restaurant/donut shop who is a germaphobe and because of is his fear of germs places his assistant/cook Sung -(Alexis Cruz) under pressure to keep up with his phobia. Ernie - (Christopher Bauer) is married to Olive - (Christina Kirk) who he is convinced is trying to; stop him have fun, look ridiculous, go insane, and not live a normal life. They begin to have petty and almost crazy arguments and Olive seriously begins to have doubts about Ernie. Gordon - (Grant Heslov) is a man whose life isn't going very well, as bad things begin to add up in his life he decides to take it in hand. Mitchel - (Jon Huertas) is convinced that Gwen - (Alexandra Westcourt) is the girl of his dreams and that they are destined for each other, though she is more skeptical. He attempts to woo her every chance he gets and he certainly makes attempts! Johnston - (Michael Hitchcock) has just been fired from his job and has doubts about his role as provider, he takes another job that he just isn't suited for. His wife Annelle - (Arabella Field) is comforting through out his job loss experience until she learns that Johnston wasn't quite the loving husband she thought he was.<br /><br />All in all I definitely suggest this movie!<br /><br />-Erica\",\n"," \"When I saw that this was going being TV, I thought cool.

The histories of British Asians fitting into their adopted home has had many good runs on the big screen, as well as a number of excellent TV and radio series (Goodness gracious me, etc). This one falls flat. Inspite of a good start it rapidly went down hill.<br /><br />Ultimately this was a horribly typical BBC effort, complete with strong regional accents, whacky over-acting characters, a \"those were the days\" soundtrack, and lots of \"issues\" in an attempt to be worthy.<br /><br />I found myself cringing at many points during this film. The writing is predictable. Every possible cliche was dragged out and aired. In fact, I have trouble thinking of any cross-cultural/cross-generational devices that could have been used that weren\\'t. The characters were thin and cliched: the eccentric non-conformist minister; the well meaning but ultimately racist old woman; the over weight, overbearing aunt; the pushy Indian parents; the working class neighbour; the \\'wise\\' profound grandmother; the motorbike riding thug. The script was weak, with every chance to shock the audience with overt racist dialogue from the two dimentional racist white characters taken. And why it had to be set in the 70\\'s (apart from needing an excuse for a 70\\'s soundtrack) is a mystery. Possibly it make unbelievable characters slightly more believable to people born after 1979. I don\\'t know.<br /><br />Even these things aside, good acting could have carried this into respectable obscurity. Instead, the usual \"BBC comedy\" suspects were wheeled out to ham it up. \"Bend it like Beckham\" had far better comic acting (and serious acting, in fact) than this, with a virtually unknown cast.<br /><br />In summary, a lazy cliched script, over acted, in a dull predictable story. Give it a miss.<br /><br />',\n"," 'Yes, it feels, and for the most part plays like an \"after school special\", for a slightly more adult audience, alright maybe a teen audience. But add in Bill Murray (already showing some dramatic as well as his usual comedic talent), a nice supporting cast, and an unexpected sweetness about growing up, and remembering those great, or not so great days at summer camp, and you get a heartwarming, funny, sleeper hit.<br /><br />It does get a little too smarmy for its own good, but that is also one of its charms. When you hear the title \"Meatballs\", and see the poster, you expect a teenage sex romp, but what you get is a sentamental, yet sometimes sexy look back at those formative years at summer camp. The sentamentality, and the remberances of simpler times reminds me of \"A Christmas Story\", which I also love. The rememberances of summer camp were never so well stated. The only movie I\\'ve seen that comes close, is \"Indian Summer\", which I like almost as much as \"Meatballs\", and also stars Matt Craven. Let\\'s hope he completes the trilogy. Maybe he could come back for \"Return of the Meatballs\", and bring some dignity back to the franchise (Meatballs 2 through 4 bare no resemblence to the original classic).<br /><br />\"Meatballs\" is easily on my Top 10 Guilty Pleasures of all time (not really guilty either).

There were whole chunks of dialogue taken from the novel, and the story followed very closely to the novel as well. All in all an excellent film.<br /><br />I am giving this a ten out of ten for the acting and the adaptation for film. Not the plot. I was disappointed with the ending of the plot of the book, and naturally, the film follows that plot. The ending is very lame, and I am sure Dickens could have thought up a much better closure.

He's no good at it and his sense of story and dialog are an insult to anyone over six years old, make that four years old; I know some six year olds who could put together a better story than this. I'm actually a fan of Dennis Quaid, can't imagine what got him into this project. Maybe he was drugged and forced to do it.

It wouldn\\'t be so incongruous if Steve and Terri were kept separated from the rest of the characters \\x96 but when the Bad Americans constantly threaten Steve\\'s life, we Confused Viewers must ask ourselves why the indifferent camera crew doesn\\'t at least call the cops if not try to poke the bad guys in the eye with the boom mics, or run screaming into the bush \\x96 anything but continue filming casually with great lighting, crisp audio and seven action angles. <br /><br />While Terri is unfairly painted as Steve\\'s mildly incompetent sidekick (her acting consists of boldly inept line reads and gadding about in pear-shaped-buttock-hugging jeans - for the last, I\\'m not complaining), Steve goes about his business-as-usual of show-and-tell with creatures intent on killing him, doing all his stunts himself because, well, to him they\\'re not really stunts, just a Day At The Office. <br /><br />Of course, watching this madman\\'s koo-koo adventures after his tragic death in September 2006 casts a strange detachment over the proceedings. But to those of us who never met him, this kind of malarkey (as well as various incarnations of the *Crocodile Hunter* series in constant re-runs) keeps him as alive as ever in our crocodile burrows. The wrenching reality of his absence will only be apparent to those nearest him. And I truly wish them the best in following in his outsize footprints\\x85 <br /><br />So enjoy this diversion for what it is \\x96 a half-baked movie featuring a full-on legend.

I was anticipating a tale of romance and seduction between an older man and his mistress within Japanese occupied China. Wow, was that not even close. True those aspects are there, but the real story is so much more involved, stimulating, and unexpected.<br /><br />After following his last Chinese language film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon with two English language works, it is nice to see Lee go back to his native tongue. I enjoyed both Hulk and Brokeback Mountain for what they were, but neither touched his martial arts epic in terms of scope or success. When hearing about Lust, Caution, I was very much excited to see what he would do with it. Looking more like a Wong Kar Wai movie, (not sure I have the credibility to make that statement seeing as I\\'ve only seen the gorgeous In the Mood For Love), I was hoping to get a sense of the character pieces he had done early in his career that I have not yet been able to view.<br /><br />If there is one thing that stays consistent through the works I have seen, it is his wonderful use of cinematography. With cameraman Rodrigo Prieto, (a man who has filmed works by favorites of mine Iñárritu and Cuarón), behind the lens, one could not expect less. After working with Lee on Brokeback Mountain, he once again shoots some stunning work. The framing is always perfect, many scenes use mirrors and glass to keep all the action on screen simultaneously, and the sexual encounters are displayed with the right amount of care and brutality necessary to get the point across on what is happening. This is one sticking point that has been gaining a lot of press around the movie. Does it deserve the NC-17 rating here in the US? Maybe. Nothing is more graphic than say HBO\\'s new series \"Tell Me You Love Me,\" yet it is more integral to the story. Many of the instances are pretty much rape, and that is something one should know going into it, in case it will deter your wanting to view the movie. However, the overall impact of what happens would not be even close to what it is had those moments been excised or edited. The sex between our two leads is the bond that connects them beyond the jobs they are doing. That physicality is what makes the final third of the film as heartbreaking as it is.<br /><br />As I said before, though, Lust, Caution is not about the love affair been characters played by the great Tony Leung and startling newcomer Wei Tang. What we really have set before us is a tale of revolution, espionage, and maturing within the confines of a world at war. Tang is just a kid who finds herself the new star actress at her school. The theatre troupe she works with decides that they should do what they can for the resistance, which they are unable to fight in. After its director, played nicely by Lee-Hom Wang, has a chance encounter with an old friend, the troupe gets to the cusp of a dangerous situation. They soon find themselves way over their heads, trying to orchestrate an assassination of a Chinese man working with the Japanese as a traitor to his country. When the event that shows the culmination of their age and inexperience plays out, it is both unexpected and unavoidable. Either way, though, they have embedded themselves into the guerilla war and eventually find that they had no chance to turn back. Meeting four years previous to the film\\'s conclusion at the back of their college theatre sealed their futures.<br /><br />While at its core we are given a story very similar to last year\\'s foreign sensation of espionage, The Lives of Others, it is shown very differently. Lee allows the story breathing room to ferment and go its course. Each \"spy\" grows up so much during the four year span of the film. Between the main two, Tang and Wang, along with Leung\\'s traitorous, political general, the evolution of each is shown in its entirety. All three\\'s motivations are clearly laid out and during the almost three hour runtime, the audience cannot become lost because they are shown absolutely everything. So, rather than build extreme tension between two people, like in the German film, Lee allows for a slow construction of backstory and relationship with all involved. All our principals grow together or apart based on what they allow themselves to do for the \"good of their nation.\" No matter how good the story itself, the film would be nothing without its magnificent acting. It is Tang and Leung that carry the movie. With so many moments of silent expression between them and some tough to stomach scenes in bed, these two amaze. The emotions are always prevalent and the decisions they make never stray from character. Yes, their relationship is unconventional, but the bond they forge cannot be taken lightly. While the middle portion might seem a bit long and monotonous to a point, the finale is a feat of genius. From Tang and Wang\\'s final look into each other\\'s eyes and Leung\\'s reaction to the clock\\'s strike of ten, all you can think is how Lee let this story be told as it should. So, I guess while I chided the industry for their almost suicidal handling of foreign films, I do need to give them some credit for still letting us Americans, who don\\'t mind reading subtitles, view them in their unedited glory. (Well at least some times, if this was a no name director and not Lee, I wouldn\\'t have been surprised if the producers changed the ending and shaved an hour off.)',\n"," \"Not a lot here in the genre of city boys wandering into hillbilly country. All the cliché's are here, but this movie takes itself too seriously as a scary movie which it is not. As a B movie its not campy enough and as a thriller it fails miserably. For hysterical laughs I would recommend Redneck Zombies made on 100th of the budget and better cheesy gore effects. If you want a serious well made movie which this one is grafted from,Deliverance is the Gold Standard and Southern Comfort comes in a close second. A newer movie, Wrong Turn has done this premise again and is also well made. If this movie would have exploited ITSELF as Redneck Zombies did it might have been better.\",\n"," '\"The Thing About my Folks\" came in as a surprise. We had no idea about what to expect. The film directed by Raymond DeFelitta, and based on a screen play by one of its stars, Paul Reiser, proved to be a pleasant time at the movies. Although the film is predictable and we know what will be the outcome, this is a voyage of discovery where Ben gets to know his father, perhaps for the first time in his life, Ben sees his father for what he really is, and not the mythical figure he has in his mind.<br /><br />The film seems to be a vehicle for its star, Peter Falk, and he runs away with the movie, as it was expected. Mr. Falk, one of the most endearing actors working in movies in this era and in past years, is an actor of such stature, he must be reckoned with. As Sam Kleinman, the distant father to Ben, he is a man that clearly is misunderstood, not only by Ben, but it appears by the whole family and his wife of forty-seven years.<br /><br />When Muriel, the matriarch of the Kleinman clan, runs away, everyone goes into a panic because this woman, who has been the strong figure of the family, is vital to keep everyone together. Not knowing where she has gone, Sam shows up at Ben\\'s house confused as he feels abandoned, suddenly, by the woman he married and has been faithful for all those years.<br /><br />Ben, the youngest son, takes his father on a trip to look for a house he wants to buy so he can get his own family out of Manhattan into the country. The trip provides the excuse for Ben to bond with his father in ways he never knew about because the old man had always projected an aloof figure to his younger son. Along the way, father and son realize how much they love one another and how misunderstood the old man has been by his children. The love of Sam for Muriel spans the many years they have known one another; they seem inseparable.<br /><br />Peter Falk is magnificent in the film. He makes an excellent Sam Kleinman, the man who suddenly realizes his life is about to change for the worst. Mr. Falk shines as the older man and there\\'s never a false movement in his interpretation of the man whose whole world is crumbling under him.<br /><br />Not being a Paul Reiser fan, we must confess that as Ben Kleinman, he is right. Ben and his father discover how much in common they both have and their love for Muriel, the mother that has sacrificed her life in order to keep the family together. Olympia Dukakis is only seen at the end of the film. She makes a good contribution as the fleeing mother. Elizabeth Perkins plays Rachel with great style..<br /><br />The film has a beautiful look thanks to the cinematography of Dan Gillham, and the excellent musical score by Steven Argila. Ultimately, the film shows a great team effort between its director, Mr. DeFelitta and Paul Reiser who wrote it for the screen.<br /><br />Although this film is clearly targeted for an older audience, it should please anyone.',\n"," 'An excellent example of what happens when one central body controls everyone.

The film is bad, in that depressing and sickening manner that certain \\'bad\\' films are. This is no guilty pleasure and this certainly isn\\'t a study of anything remotely interesting despite the clear intentions it has. What else can you say about a film that brutally murders off the one, decent character whom tries to help others and then resorts to having its lead characters conform to horrific acts of animal cruelty for good measure? <br /><br />The film centers on a female youth named Katrina (Barclay) and like the hurricane of her namesake, this little monster whirls bucket loads of chaos as she whirls around the general area causing havoc. Katrina has achieved what little ambition she has very early on in the film: her face on newspapers and her figure on television \\x96 it\\'s a celebrity status through horrific acts that someone like Charles Manson might know all about but the thing that\\'s more agitating is its obvious reek of Natural Born Killers and how Suburban Mayhem uses the distorted television perspective complete with \\'the guilty\\' speaking into a camera in a mock interview set up \\x96 isn\\'t that a clicé yet? If not, why not \\x96 I hate the convention and I hate how it makes people that do it feel clever because it \\'breaks the fourth wall\\' and that\\'s so \\'out there\\' when it comes to mainstream cinema. You\\'re not fooling anyone.<br /><br />So the film revolves around Katrina and we see her story told to us in flashback format. Now, the term anti-hero is one that springs to mind here but I\\'m not going to apply it to Katrina because she (as does the film overall) doesn\\'t deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as the term. An anti-hero is someone who isn\\'t quite on the level of \\'good\\' but knows what they want and we feel a guilty urge to want them to win, even if it clashes with our own moral codes. Here, Katrina has a child, a child that she neglects and ignores in a couple of scenes that are just disturbing in her ruthlessness. Her father, John (Morgan), threatens to have the child taken away unless she sorts out her drug plagued; mischief plagued and crime plagued life. But she cannot have that and enters femme fatale mode to seduce a local nut-case named Kenny (Hayes) into killing her father for her. I don\\'t think anyone in their right minds is going to want Katrina to get away with this.<br /><br />The film\\'s draw is a question that doubles up as its own hypothesis: \"Can you really get away with murder?\" thus tempting us to watch to see if someone actually might. Well, unless you\\'re Jack the Ripper in 19th Century, or whenever it was, Britain \\x96 no, you can\\'t. The question the writers and co. should\\'ve asked one another in a filmic sense is: \"Should you really be able to get away with murder?\" This is what they fail to spot by the time Katrina is just about home free and documenting to us her story from the confines of the future. If the film is so interested in the quirky delivery of the study of achieving celebrity fame through infamy then Natural Born Killers sets the bar and Van Sant\\'s \\'To Die For\\' is sub-Natural Born Killers; and Scott\\'s \\'Domino\\' is sub-To Die For which means this film is sub-Domino, which is really scraping the bottom of the barrel given how much I hated Domino.<br /><br />So the \\'anti-hero\\' on this occasion is not someone who will force us into questioning our own moral codes as much as she will force us to pray that she dies a slow death not too far into the film\\'s beginning. The drug taking; threatening innocents at home; baby rejecting disaster that is Katrina struts about and moves into seducing Kenny for her own dirty work; we are not amused and we are not enthralled and we cannot believe what we\\'re seeing. These days, the idea of becoming an overnight success for young people is, arguably, at its peak what with the extensive reality TV shows and so forth. I only pray this film be seen by as few as these young people as possible because in the end, the film is a glorification of a young girl who has attained celebrity status through things like pregnancy and getting caught up in a murder plot and what-not. What alarms me is that, here in Britain, the film was classed as a \\'15\\' certificate meaning most any teenager can access it.<br /><br />I felt dirty when I watched Suburban Mayhem. The film is misjudged in its overall delivery and presentation of its ideas; a fun, fast and frenetic series of scenes that revolve around trench-coat wearing hermits being told to kill people on the promise of an easy lay from someone we\\'re supposed to be gunning for. If you want a more mature look at working class life in Australia, as made by the Australians, I recommend 2005\\'s \\'Peaches\\' but Suburban Mayhem is a messy and childish exercise best viewed by as few people as possible.',\n"," 'We brought this film as a joke for a friend, and could of been our worst joke to play.

The Chinese Manchu government is after these revolutionaries, and anyone that stands in their way is in trouble, even if they are in the police force.

Jackie Chan and his stunt team don\\'t disappoint here at all. The ending is very entertaining, Jackie Chan shows us why HE is the best stuntman in the world. Really exciting stuff!

(Just read some professional reviews on the internet, and they\\'ll only mention two ones--the \\'39 and \\'95). Perhaps that\\'s because quite a few haven\\'t read the novel, or just because it\\'s a classic, dismiss it as \"boring\" and \"irrelevant\" to today\\'s society. But for those of us who have read the novel and loved it, this is by far the best movie of \"The Little Princess\" made. It doesn\\'t rely on special effect interludes, like the \\'95 one, or cute little song and dance sessions like movie of \\'39. Here we just get the story as it is with all the characters presented in exactly the way the novel depicts them. Amelia Shankley did a wonderful job as Sara Crewe. She looked dark, thin and solemn, just as described in the novel, and acted quiet and wise as well. In fact, all the actors and actresses did a good job. Even if Lottie didn\\'t look quite the way as described, she acted it out so well that it didn\\'t matter at all. And that goes for everybody else who\\'s in this. I watched this with my mother and she agreed that it was very well done, and that all the children were quite appealing. As well, the sets and costumes were not too bold, like in the \\'95 version (can you tell I didn\\'t like that one?). Sara\\'s surroundings are SUPPOSED to look drab and grey. If you\\'ve never seen a version of \"The Little Princess\" or read the book--obviously read the novel first, then see this one.

There was real scope here for a wittier script, instead it all got rather tedious, 30 minutes could easily have been lopped off the running time.<br /><br />At least it was good to see actors like Douglas, Fox and Hartmann in their prime, its sad to see what has happened to that trio now.',\n"," \"Shecky, is a god damned legend, make no mistake.

Their target, a new Gundam being built exclusively for Newtypes (supposedly built for Amuro Ray from the original Gundam saga) inside. When little boy Al Izuruha, a fan of Zeon MS, encounters a Zaku after battle breaks out in the colony, he befriends newbie MS pilot Benard \"Bernie\" Wiseman. The two become good friends, Al is treated as an honorary member of the Cyclops team. Through the show, Bernie acts as a father figure to Al (whose real father is always working) and seems to be taken with Federation pilot Christina McKenzie, but eventually they must meet....in battle. Al soon learns that war is not child\\'s play and Bernie must choose to make the ultimate sacrifice to complete his mission.<br /><br />For only 6 episodes, Gundam 0080 is a well done show. The mobile suits are extremely well designed, and the animation may look dated but really shows emotion in the characters. If you liked 0083 then check this one out, or if you are new to the Gundam world, this is a good show to start with. If you look to a show for drama and character development, this is the one for you, it focuses more on that then mobile suit battle. I would rate it more of a drama than action.<br /><br />Mobile Suit Gundam 0080, War in the Pocket. <br /><br />Sometimes you have to lose to win.',\n"," 'This movie contains the famous bantering and mind games that Bud Abbott always pulled on Lou Costello...this adds to the entertainment value and it is great to watch a movie that is just plain entertaining! This movie also contains the Andrews Sisters, who are so great! I love singing in a movie and the use of it is very well done. This movie also gives you a pretty accurate account of \"going into the service\" for that time era.The military point of view of \"Buck Privates\" shows the innocence of so many of our young men and women that enter the service of Uncle Sam.It is very interesting to see how things have changed in the last 60 years,as well,not only in T.V and movies, but in the service, too. Abbott and Costello bring humanity to the stiffness of military regimen in \"Buck Privates\". The cast that was chosen shows a great chemistry with the comedians. A \"must- see\" for movie buffs that appreciate the old black & white movies.',\n"," \"I won't profess to be articulate writing comments about movies (in fact this is my first one on this site), but I found this film wholly unsatisfying and disappointing to watch.<br /><br />The first 20 minutes or so actually promised a lot and I was intrigued. The central protagonist had a peculiar lack of lines and the college girls venomous retort after his first unwanted advance made you wonder who was really the bad guy.<br /><br />However this all started to change in the contrived and unconvincing way in which she was coerced into prostitution. She lost her backbone, she spent more time sobbing and several inexplicable plot holes creep into the story. An unconvincing time distortion (for want of better words) works it's way into the story that I felt took away from the plot instead of adding depth to it. The writer may have been trying to be metaphorical, but in the context of the rest of the film, it was just out of place. And finally, the central characters silence I believe hamstrings the movie, unlike in a Kevin Smith movie where when Silent Bob speaks, actually has something profound to say.<br /><br />By the end of the movie, I could not care for either the girl or the main character and the ending neither seemed appropriate nor inappropriate for them. I simply didn't care for them... let alone despise them.\",\n"," \"It seems likely that the only thing getting 'The Breed' off the shelves is the lure of it's young cast, and in particular, its co-stars Michelle Rodgriguez and Oliver Reed. Or, at least it might suffice, as the random date movie title for younger viewers. For all else, The Breed, is little more than a template horror movie that, although has the rare incentive of decent acting, offers extremely limited thrills or even decent writing.<br /><br />The story centers on a group of friends--two of them being brothers--who return to their uncle's old cabin on some forested island, unaware that it is infested with a pack of vicious dogs that have either contracted a furious case of rabies or have escaped a genetic experiment (the writers seem to have a hard time deciding on which they'd rather go with, despite the stupidity in character's reasoning for the former). And that is essentially what the eighty some minutes of screen time boils down to--escaping the dogs. And of course, all that follows is from beginning to end is completely standard from the black guy getting killed first to the divergent brothers forced settle their differences when their lives depend on it.<br /><br />It's quite the forgettable movie.\",\n"," 'if u haven\\'t seen Vijay in \"Ghillli\", \"Gilly\" or \"Ghillie\". go watch it. wow. its devastatingly hilarious. i don\\'t know if Dharani (the brilliant director) was being serious or not.

That production introduced me to the book, which I have read many times and loved my whole life. I can't believe I was so young when I saw it, because it made such a deep impression on me and I understood it so clearly, even at a young age. <br /><br />Seeing it again on DVD, some of the early scenes made me laugh because the acting is rather wooden, and the production values are very 1970s. However, when we get to the interaction between Jane and Rochester, it comes alive and I forgot the datedness of the production. The dialogue is straight out of the book, and in some places this makes it unrealistic and cumbersome, but the narration in Jane's voice is wonderful, because it lets us know what she in thinking. Other productions have not done this, and sometimes it's useful to know why she acts as she does. The developing love between Jane and Rochester and the enduring nature of that love is the central theme and that is beautifully done. <br /><br />Sorcha Cusack conveys Jane's determination and intelligence very well, even though she looks too old for the part, and Michael Jayston is the best Rochester ever. This is a must see for Jane Eyre fans!\",\n"," 'Orson Welles\\' \"The Lady From Shanghai\" does not have the brilliant screenplay of \"Citizen Kane,\" e.g., but Charles Lawton, Jr.\\'s cinematography, the unforgettable set pieces (such as the scene in the aquarium, the seagoing scene featuring a stunning, blonde-tressed Rita Hayworth singing \"Please Don\\'t Love Me,\" and the truly amazing Hall of Mirrors climax), and the wonderful cast (Everett Sloane in his greatest performance, Welles in a beautifully under-played role, the afore-mentioned Miss Hayworth--Welles\\' wife at the time--at her most gorgeous) make for a very memorable filmgoing experience. The bizarre murder mystery plot is fun and compelling, not inscrutable at all. The viewer is surprised by the twists and turns, and Welles\\' closing line is an unheralded classic. \"The Lady From Shanghai\" gets four stars from this impartial arbiter.',\n"," \"This movie has made me a rugby -- and Coach Larry Gelwix -- fan. The story's characters slipped and fell before they begin to grow as they struggled through incredibly strong conflicts. Those were understandable and completely believable. Like life, there were no easy answers for the problems facing them all. Superb actors and an excellent script brought this true story to life. I wish there were more movies like this one. These days, I watch almost exclusively, worthwhile true stories because they are typically far more interesting than fiction. Additionally, this one is inspirational and it teaches us to not to give up on anyone too quickly.\",\n"," 'The director states in the Behind-the-Scenes feature that he loves horror movies. He loves them so much that he dedicated the movie to Dario Argento, as well as other notable directors such as George A. Romero and Tobe Hooper. Basically dedicating this movie to those great directors is like giving your mother a piece of sh*t for Mother\\'s Day. The first thing they did wrong was the casting. CAST PEOPLE THAT CAN ACT. Also, don\\'t cast a person that is 40 years old for the role of a misunderstood, 18 year old recluse. That\\'s right, he\\'s been in high school for 22 years. The reactions made by people as they watch their boyfriends get their hearts ripped out is amusing. Or like one part when a guy gets stabbed in the ear with an ear of corn (haha get it), and his girlfriend just goes, \"Oh..my.. God?\" The scarecrow himself is quite a character. Doing flips off cars and calling people losers.<br /><br />The movie does have one redeeming factor... oh wait, no it doesn\\'t.<br /><br />If you absolutely MUST see this movie, than just watch the Rock and Roll trailer on the DVD.

Shot on a micro budget of $6,000 this is a student film with real class. The film is shot in black and white, and features people who you assume are friends of Nolan's appearing in the movie. This is not to say they are bad actors because they are quite good. You could see Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw appearing in other projects but unfortunately they haven't since this was made 6 years ago.<br /><br />Nolan's thriller, much like Memento, does not play chronologically, it shifts the scenes around much like Pulp Fiction. The writing is fantastic. It is a great twisting thriller but because the temporal order of the film is shifted around it makes it even more interesting. I thought the last ten minutes in particular when everything starts to become clear were excellent.<br /><br />For a film of such a small budget and with no recognizable names at all, this is so good. It is superior to most that Hollywood studios offer and Nolan after three films (this, the superior Memento and the not quite as good but still excellent Insomnia) has cemented himself as the most exciting new talent of recent times. I can't wait for Batman.<br /><br />This film is short and sweet and certainly a great watch. It is very professional and the twists are fantastic and completely surprising. I also thought that the score from David Julyan was also excellent, very atmospheric and had a chilly quality to it. He has gone on to compose Nolan's other films. <br /><br />Overall I would recommend this, I intend to get all of Nolan's films. This is a low budget gem. *****<br /><br />\",\n"," \"I rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case. Judge and Jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun, but this movie got progressively stupider as it went on. David Keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent. Judge and Jury was well plain dumb I gave it a 3 should have gave it a 2, I gave it an extra star just because David Keith's gun was cool.\",\n"," 'I sneaked into this R rated film when I was 13 thinking this film was something it was not. However I was rewarded with a truly funny film! At that time I got most of the jokes. In all that year I probably saw the film 10 times. We had a book of passes to the theater and were such fixtures we could get into any film, sans parent.<br /><br />I just watched it again on Encore. This was the first time I have seen it since I was 13 and I am amazed at how well the film still holds up. It was also amazing to see the amount of talent Allen had to work with in the film. Such as Burt Reynolds, John Carridadine, Gene Wilder, Tony Randall and the always great Louise Lasser. You can also see how some of the skits inspired Saturday Night Live which was to come years later.<br /><br />If you watch the film, and you should, you will be amazed at the look of the film. It looks as thought it was made much later than 72 but I guess Allen was ahead of his time. It may also amaze some people that Allen was actually funny at one time. With this film coming at the time of Bananas and Sleeper one could not ask for a better time for Allen to make this film. It also makes you think about Allen and his foster step daughter in the context of this film. <br /><br />Do yourself a favor and rent Bananas, Sleeper and this film. Catch Woody when he was funny. His one liners in this film are worth the rental price alone.',\n"," 'Never been kissed starring Drew Barymore as Reporter Josie Gellar is a sweet, extremely sappy and sometimes quite painful tale of a timid woman named Josie Gellar who though brilliant is quiet and shy and has never been kissed by a man. She is assigned her first major news story for the newspaper she works for-to go undercover as a high school student befriend the popular cool kids and get a scoop as to what really goes on in the world of high school. Only problem is Josie has never been popular. High School was in fact, a traumatizing experience for her as she was the recipient of quite a lot of teasing and cruel jokes. Josie grabs this assignment, as much to finally \"fit in\" as to get a scoop-what she finds is the major premise of the story.<br /><br />Never been kissed is one of those movies that\\'s so sappy and schmaltzy at times, particularly in a few scenes at the end that the limits of believability are sorely tested and many a cynic may not like this movie. It is however, very sweetly done. Drew Barymore is perfect as the bumbling yet lovely Josie-she breathes a breath of fresh air into the character and makes her appear perfectly realistic. I also enjoyed Leelee Sobiesky as the intellectual student who befriends Josie on her first day at the school.<br /><br />Never been kissed has some really funny moments as Josie unravels in her frantic efforts to be cool. Example-the reggae bar scene.I also loved the appearance of Josie\\'s brother Rob who also goes back and signs up as a high school student, the way that he helps to give Josie her \"dream\" of finally fitting in is just hilarious. At the same time, as Josie\\'s woeful story of her original years in high school are shown in flashback it is extremely painful. You do not need to have had similar experiences in high school to Josie to be affected by her story-Drew is wonderful at making her character have a personal connection with the audience and we adore Josie from the beginning.<br /><br />there is a lot of \"mean girls\" a 2004 release, in this movie but mean girls honestly was a lot grittier. Never been kissed becomes very much a romantic pic as Josie develops feelings for a certain man and the question becomes will they get together.<br /><br />I liked this movie. It was really beautifully done in some areas. The movie is corny in some places yes, the last scene-realistic-no way-does this movie manipulate your emotions in the most obvious Hollywood way? Oh yeah yeah yeah baby! But it manipulates beautifully, there are some lessons to be learned here. The movie never preaches but manages to paint an accurate picture of what high school was like for a select few. I have actually met people who have had similar experiences to Josie-I\\'ve met people very much like all these characters-I think a lot of people simply don\\'t know or can\\'t conceive of the cruelty that can exist in the world of high school, and how hurtful it can be, but it\\'s there. Not unrealistic at all. What struck me was Drew\\'s speech at the prom, as she demonstrates the \"sheep mentality\" that can exist so prevalently -as Hollywood and manufactured as many think that may be, it was well done and very true. <br /><br />I\\'m making never been kissed sound a lot heavier then it is, in truth this is a perfect movie to pick when one wants a sweet feel good light heartwarming picture. It\\'s engaging, sweetly acted and just Rufus. I\\'d say check it out. 8 of 10.',\n"," 'This is a pretty bad movie. The plot is sentimental mush. I suppose the production values are OK, decent photography, unobtrusive direction and all that. Mark Hamill was terrible. I\\'ve never cared much for him, and this movie validates that perception. It\\'s no wonder that he never really had any sort of career aside from his \"Star Wars\" films. I\\'ll just say \"Buh-bye, Mark\" as he sinks into well-deserved obscurity. On the other hand, a very young Annie Potts utterly stole the show. She showed charm, beauty, and acting chops all in one performance. I remember seeing her in \"Texasville\" recently and taking note of her beauty. It\\'s interesting seeing her from ten years earlier. Anyway, unless you are interested in Miss Potts, run away from this film screaming for the hills.',\n"," \"Hard to believe this was directed by Fritz Lang since he mostly directed crime dramas and mysteries.

Jagger hires a lot of men to make sure it is done because they have to worry about Indian attacks and bandits. Scott is in charge of the men and Young is a telegraph expert who can't shoot a gun but can ride. Scott meets up with his old gang who want to stop them but Scott can't tell anyone.

Dawn of the Dead was such an entertaining flick, by no means an Oscar Winner but certainly a well thought out display of zombie gore and emotional interaction between likable and interesting characters.. Dawn of the Dead even ended well, paving the way for an intense sequel with a spoiler sneak peak of what's to come for the characters at the end of the movie. Day of the Dead is not that sequel.<br /><br />Day of the Dead is almost laughably terrible. The acting is shallow and boring at best. Yes, Ving Rhames is in this, but somehow the producers managed to make Ving look amateurish and uncomfortable. Not only is Ving not the same character as he was in Dawn of the Dead but then they had the audacity to kill him off with the first thirty minutes and turn him into a pathetic, eye-eating, legless zombie. <br /><br />The zombies look fake and in no way menacing. The editing is sloppy and choppy and quite frankly, by the end of the movie I was really just hoping to see all of the unintelligent main characters end up zombie feed. The only thing that saved this movie from making me really angry was the fact that I had it recorded it on DVR and I could fast forward through most of it and then have the satisfaction of hitting 'DELETE' when it was over.<br /><br />Don't waste your time.

This is a good movie, it is a little cheesy but I must say, I think the Video Game company, Capcom, saw this movie and heavily used parts of this for the game Resident Evil. For example; replace Albert Wesker from R.E. with Barry Bostwick, the Tyrant with a metal werewolf and keep the main characters pretty much the same. The way Barry Bostwick dies is the same way Albert dies and the same for the werewolf dying just like the Tyrant. The story simply goes like this; in 1974, the US military goes into the Carpathian forest to find a werewolf to get it's blood and use it's DNA to create the ultimate biological weapon(like Resident Evil again)but one of the men gets too cocky and takes the blood himself and all hell breaks loose (close enough to RE to mention it again). Barry Bostwick manages to take down and put the cocky werewolf guy in deep freeze until 20 years later when technology has advanced enough to resume the project. Of course, the werewolf gets loose again and causes havoc again or else there wouldn't be a movie.

The film is obviously derived from \"Enter The Dragon,\" as are most martial arts pictures. Only instead of a real martial art, they concoct an absurd new martial art, accurately described by one critic as \"a cross between Kung Fu and break dancing.\" A gymnast (Thomas, of course) is hired to rescue some lady from an impenetrable fortress, yet every room has a prop that is exactly what Thomas needs to kick the assistant baddies.

Murer clearly has a great rapport with children and brings out a credible performance from the nonprofessional actor (but real-life musical virtuoso) Teo Gheorghiu -- especially considering that so much of the film rests on this young pianist's shoulders.

An example would be Walter Schirra (Henriksen) \\x96 his name is mentioned a couple of times, and he probably had a tenth of the screen time of the others. Plainly, with an already three hour running time not everyone could have equal time, so this is certainly a mild criticism. `The Right Stuff' isn't profound or exceptional, but it is certainly a good and interesting film.<br /><br />--Shelly\",\n"," 'Surprisingly well-acted, well-written movie about hard rockin\\'-but-decent young man getting that much-hoped-for ticket to stardom: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer. Not far-fetched, the film tries keeping things in perspective and doesn\\'t go over-the-top; it certainly makes you think twice about those lingering adolescent fantasies about being in the music business. But the script, despite solid dialogue, follows a tried-and-true, formulaic pattern, and gets bogged down by its own clichés in the final act. I enjoyed it much more than the sugary fluffball \"Almost Famous\". It has a nice, bitter edge to go with its heavy metal decadence, but a stronger finish might\\'ve made it more memorable. **1/2 from ****',\n"," \"When I first heard about Moon Child, I thought it was a joke. After a few months, I figured I guess it's for real. The few reviews I read that WEREN'T made by squealing fangirls were not very promising.<br /><br />When I was given the opportunity to watch it, I was fully prepared to groan, wince, and otherwise need to close my eyes to avoid the silliness.<br /><br />I was more than a little surprised, and in a good way.<br /><br />Yes, Moon Child has its moments of cheese, camp, and general dorkiness -- I think that's kind of impossible to avoid when it involves Gackt Camui, a man not known for his sanity -- but all in all, it was wholly enjoyable.<br /><br />No, it is not a work of cinema genius but it is very, very heartfelt, amusing, with fun choreography, a touching score, and a fun cast. I know little of Japanese cinema so I can't really judge the acting but considering the fact that the cast was speaking a language or extreme dialect foreign to them at one time or another and that a couple of them have almost no acting experience, I was rather impressed.<br /><br />If you can enjoy a good action movie, a good drama, a good comedy, see this film. At least rent it since it's coming to Region 1.<br /><br />On a side note, there is zero homosexual/homoerotic content in this film. I didn't even see much of a subtext.

This one didn't have a predictable story entirely but it did drag out for the first hour and it failed to have enough excitement to wake me back up towards the final 42 minutes. I have seen much worse from lions gate, but then again I have seen much better. I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone because it really bored me a lot and the ending was really cheesy. I mean I didn't see it coming or anything but it was still stupid and the acting isn't very good in the film either but I don't look at that as much if its a good story but this movie was just a plain old sleeper compared to the awesome horror films I have seen in the past.<br /><br />So anyways this movie isn't worth your 3 dollars to rent it and surprisingly its not made by Ulli Lommel.

Fantastic. And set in Paris! This could be great. But unfortunately, Korrine may spark the odd decent idea but because he is an awful writer, the story fails on every level and the audience walkout I witnessed about an hour in is proof positive that he is the most boring and pretentious film-making out there. Apparently the walk-out rate at its premiere in last years Cannes festival was quite shocking. Instead of focusing on the two protagonists, he switches the story stupidly to the confines of a château to introduce a bunch of other impersonators making the whole experience tedious and narratively barren.

Unfortunately, it was impossible considering the number of failings that this film had.<br /><br />You know those sticker activity books that you buy for your kids, where they can place characters/creatures anywhere they like to make their own story? That is what this movie is. There is no sense of place, environment or even interaction established through the audio/visuals.<br /><br />The central tale concerns a small fish who lost his parents (awwwwww) and then meets a lovely girl at the reef, only to have her proposed to by a big, bad shark and then he realises that he has a month to get trained up and ready to challenge that shark, for better or worse. Like The Karate Kid, but with fish.<br /><br />This review is not a good one so let me just rattle off all of the bad points.

Pokémon fans are suffering in America these days. Why? Because we rely on Kids WB and 4Kids Entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies. As far as the series goes, they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the Japanese versions to television. So what is their problem when it comes to the movies? Honestly now, I have seen all three Pokémon movies in Japanese and I will definitely be seeing the fourth one. They are excellent movies. They are all enjoyable and fun to watch. And, after seeing Pokémon 2000 in theaters, I can't help but wonder how these American producers read the Japanese scripts. The way it appears, it seems that they read and see something that says `Insert empty moral here' in big bold faced letters. It definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on MSB (extreme sarcasm there) and created this crap.<br /><br />*possible spoilers from here on*<br /><br />Well, I guess I should first talk about Pikachu's Rescue Adventure. My first gripe with this came with no narration. I guess they got enough bad comments on the Pokédex narration that plagued Pikachu's Vacation, and, instead of going with a caring, gentle woman's voice as appeared in Pikachu no Natsu Yasumi and Pikachu Tankentai, they just cut the narration all together. This wouldn't have been a problem, except for one thing. Did anyone really understand why the Exeggcute didn't let Togepi go until the end? Possibly the fans, but I'm sure not the parents. Then, there's the theme song. I couldn't help but roll my eyes at this one. The Japanese theme song was `Tankentai wo Tsukurou' and was sung by Japanese children. It was fun and enjoyable. This one: nauseating. Now, one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing Kireihana. Nice music, fun to watch. That's changed with the Bellossom. The music sucked for one, but on top of that, they had all the Pokémon talk during the music, which turned out to be jumpy, annoying, and just unnecessary. Oh, and then there's the Poliwhirl who thinks he's a Poliwrath. You'd think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are. Basically, not much could save this little ill fated dub, which is very unfortunate considering its potential. But, I haven't touched on the worst of it yet.<br /><br />You'd think that the warning signs would've been apparent to me when I received my issue of Nintendo Power. For some unfathomable reason, I had been placing some faith in 4Kids and the WB. My thoughts were `well, they screwed up on the first movie, but the second is different as far as the theme goes, so they should do well.' That in mind, I just didn't pay attention to the warning signs I encountered in the theaters when the trailers said, `You will believe that one person can make all the difference.' With the way they said that at every turn, I was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like MSB did at the end of the English version. Then comes Nintendo Power, in which I see all my fears realized in the words `the main feature 'The Power of One.' At that point, I became a bit more uneasy. `The Power of One?!' Not a good sign. However, I still kept some of my false faith. Big mistake.<br /><br />Sitting in the theater, I was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which I loved in Japanese being turned into complete and utter junk. I hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle. I can see a point in that since they didn't pander this thing, repeating it over and over like in MSB. However, it did more damage than anything else in this movie. First of all, the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read `the world turns to Ash.' Ah hah. So, Ash is the chosen one? Whatever. In the Japanese version, the inhabitants of Arshia needed a Pokémon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony. This time, he's the chosen one. A greater way that this did damage was to Lugia. Lugia was one of the coolest characters in a Pokémon movie.... when the movie was ABOUT Lugia. In this one, Lugia is forced to take a back seat to Ash. In the scene where they're flying back to the main island, Lugia and Ash are discussing the conditions of Lugia's existence, not that Ash is going to make all the difference. Overall in this category, Ash wasn't really the `one person' that would make the difference, since he was helped by many along the way.<br /><br />A lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking. Furura's flute song wasn't nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the Japanese one. Jirarudan's speech to them saying his collection `started with a Mew card?' Ugh. Even worse, Misty's outrage originally concerned the way Moltres and Zapdos were being held. `Why didn't you put them in Pokéballs when you caught them? This is like caging them to be displayed.' Much different from whining about him thinking Pokémon are things to be collected like stamps. If there were any real redeeming values in this, they came from Team Rocket. Some pretty funny lines. Not really to make me laugh out loud, but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach. Well, that was officially the last American Pokémon movie I'm going to see. I've imported the third one and find it very enjoyable. I would rather not see another Japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two. I'll be importing the fourth one as well. Forget you, Kids WB and 4Kids. You have forsaken me for the last time.\",\n"," \"This first (and hopefully not last) Wallace & Gromit feature lives up to expectations.

Well-known writers Stephen J. Cannell of \"The A-Team\" and Philip DeGuere of \"Simon & Simon\" have contrived a formulaic, half-baked World War II secret mission behind enemy lines that is neither convincing nor exciting. The gimmick that the heroes rely on to deliver the explosives is the best idea in this lackluster adventure opus.<br /><br />This 77-minute melodrama spends its opening 14 minutes providing exposition to set up its plot. During that opening quarter hour, we are treated to an \"Untouchables\" style narrator and loads of second-unit shots mixed in with artwork and stock footage. We see a German E-Boat\\x97or what passes for one\\x97off the French command intercept French radio signals. A fight between two agents ensues over possession of the toxin and the vial crashes into the floor and releases a nasty plume of smoke. The Allied agent suffers terribly while the German escapes. Eventually, doctors in England treat the Allied agent but he <br /><br />Our brash, fun-loving heroes parachute into France. Actually, Selleck\\'s character boots Whitmore out of the plane and follows him down. A colorful band of traveling gypsies picks them up and serves as their cover during the trip to the winery. Our heroes have no money to pay for their escort so the gypsies appropriate Selleck\\'s West Point ring\\x97yeah, right, what was he thinking when he brought it on this mission\\x97and Whitmore\\'s watch. Little do they know that the Germans are racing ahead of them for the same destination. Perennial bad guy Albert Paulson commands the Axis intruders as a German colonel. Selleck masquerades as a German officer in order to enter the grounds of the winery. Whitmore taps into the communications line and calls ahead to German headquarters in the winery and inquires about an officer. The radio operator reports that no such officer is available. Whitmore complains that he should be notified to report back to him as soon as possible. This clever ruse helps Selleck effect entry since the Germans are expecting him. He fixes up things so that the plumbing backs up. The German colonel demands that the problem be dealt with in short order. Whitmore pretends to be a plumber taking a roadside break when German motorcycle troops discover his presence and escort him to the winery. As it turns out, this is exactly what our heroes want. Meantime, the Germans discover the gypsies in the woods, but they miss the strong man. He opens the water lines and sends metal tubes streaking through the lines. Inside the tubes are explosive devices. After he sends Whitmore all the explosive tubes, he drives his wagon off, only to be intercepted by German troops that take him prisoner. In the winery, Whitmore enters the vault where the vials of toxin chemicals are stored. Before he fiddles with the vials, he slips explosives to Selleck who has relieved the guards in front of the vault. Selleck and he set their charges and on the way out of the winery, they spot the gypsy father and daughter as well as the Germans escorting the strong man in the wagon.<br /><br />The last quarter hour involves their predictable heroics at rescuing the gypsies. Whitmore and Selleck succeed in their mission and the winery is blown sky-high. The \"Untouchables\" narrator furnishes us with a history lesson about the Italians declaring war on France and the Germans marching on Paris. <br /><br />Whitmore and Selleck play reasonably well off each other, but they are thwarted by embarrassing dialogue, especially when they are voicing themselves over in long shots. Veteran TV lenser Enzo A. Martinelli makes everything look good in this otherwise forgettable fare. Among the many anachronisms present here is Tom Selleck\\'s haircut that was right for the 1970s but all wrong for 1940. I don\\'t think that I\\'ve ever seen a German officer with a mustache the size of the one that Selleck wears. \"The Gypsy Warriors\" plays like a World War II version of the \"The Wild, Wild West\" with Whitmore doing all the dirty work and Selleck striking tough guy poses.',\n"," \"I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old. Unfortunately I could not watch it to the end because it was aired late at night. Now I bought it on DVD because I can remember that I liked it.<br /><br />This is really not an ordinary horror movie. It has some horror elements but I rather categorize it as fantasy. I liked it but I hoped for a bit more horror and scary scenes. Especially the scene when Anna's dad comes into the paperhouse trying to kill her is a bit short.<br /><br />Now to the plot. This movie is about a young girl named Anna who gets ill. While she is ill and has to lie in her bed because of her high fewer she turns on to finishing her drawing about a house - the paperhouse. When she fells a sleep, which often strangely happens just immediately, she finds herself near the house on a big green field. She realizes that the house is exactly like the one she has drawn and that every new detail also appears in her dreams. One day she draws a boy into the house to have somebody to talk to. As she forgets to draw his legs (because he is sitting behind a window) the boy cannot walk. Later she is being told by the doctor, that a boy also has this strange disease and she realizes that with the boy she has drawn, she also got that boy into her disturbing dreams. She also notices that it gets harder and harder for her to wake up from her dreams. As she misses her father who is ofter abroad she draws her father into the house. She makes a mistake and her father is looking very angry on the painting. She tries to rubber him out but realizes that she cannot change anything already drawn. And next time she falls asleep the horror begins. Her father is mad and blind (because she draw s*** on his head to mark him as 'invalid') and tries to get into the paperhouse and kill Anna and his friend. Her dreams became a horrendous nightmare. They manage to escape and to kill her father and Anna can finally wake up. Than Anna finds her self in the hospital where her parents are sitting beside her bed. The doctors thought that she fell into a coma or so. They tell Anna that the other boy died and that they want to travel to the ocean to get over those tragical happenings. Anna draws a watchtower and notices that the same watchtower can be found near the hotel they traveled to. She runs to the watchtower and meets the boy (I am just not mentioning his name because I cannot remember it and do not want to go back to the previous html page) and can say good bye to him and forget those terrible dreams forever.<br /><br />There were a few thing I did not understand in the movie. First of all it was the ending which I absolutely dislike. I think it is too long while the main part of the movie becomes a bit too short. How does the boy fly a helicopter and speak to Anna as he is supposed to be dead? Why did you have to put such a stupid radio on the wall? I hated that scene it was so dumb to me. It almost ruined the main horror scene.<br /><br />Things I liked were the scene with the photograph of Anna's dad which was the first real scary and horror scene. I liked the boy. The actor was awesome. He was even better than Anna. I also liked how Anna tries to get her father out of the painting while she is asleep and how she is looking for it in the garbage.<br /><br />Overall a good movie. I give it a 8 out of 10.\",\n"," 'I\\'m sorry to say, but Hungarian cinema (especially comedies) nowadays is really bad.

I am referring to the miniseries that aired in the US with Depardieu and Malkovich. Maybe the French version - twice as long? - is more true to the novel, but the version we saw here was shockingly distorted.<br /><br />Yes - all of the characters were there, but their roles were often twisted beyond recognition. One GLARING example: Eponine. If you have read the novel, you know that she is one of the most heroic characters, sacrificing herself for Marius. Did I miss something here? They turn her into one of the villains. Gavroche's role is also misrepresented. If they were going to take all that time, why not do it as Hugo wrote it? It is also very odd to make Cosette the narrator, as she is deliberately one of the weaker, more insipid characters in the novel. And Valjean was never in love with Cosette. He is genuinely an adoptive father.<br /><br />Depardieu is beautifully cast as Valjean, but John Malkovich (I'm a fan, too) plays Javert as if he were simply mean - with none of the nuances of the tortured character that Geoffrey Rush portrays. The 1998 Bille August film is by far the superior interpretation, despite what he leaves out. And the musical theater version is the best of all, faithful to both the plot and spirit of Hugo's masterpiece.\",\n"," \"Historically, this film is a heap of hooey. If Robin Hood ever existed, he would have lived about 150 years after the period in which the film is set. Modern historians are of the opinion that good King Richard and bad King John should be the other way around. This film should be thus regarded as fantasy.<br /><br />The fact that so many Robin Hood films have been made since, and not one of them remotely measures up to The Adventures of Robin Hood shows just how good the film is.<br /><br />Favourite scenes? Well, there's the scene in the great hall at Nottingham castle where Errol Flynn gives cheek to everyone. The escape, the ambush and the final showdown with Sir Guy of Gisborne. (Basil Rathbone makes a superb villain.) I'm very impressed with the sharpshooting. This was done by Howard Hill. Howard Hill appears a few times in the film. In the escape from the great hall he is the only archer among Guy of Gisburne's crossbowmen. In the archery tournament scene, he is Owen the Welshman (in spite of what it says in the credits at the end.)

First, when Denny\\'s partner has been fatally wounded, and he makes a dramatic speech about how he always stood for the law, and obeying the exact letter of it. Then, he says something like, \"Boy, was I stupid!\" Which is his way of telling Denny to become a vigilante instead, which he does (though the TV Batman kind). Then, there\\'s the scene where he tries to seduce the villainess into letting him go by kissing her, but she isn\\'t fooled, because he\\'s too honest to kiss her convincingly !

They have great chemistry together (I guess being married in real life helps that!) - in the movie they are both widowed with children and careers and they fall in love and try blend their already busy chaotic families together without dropping the ball. Of course they stumble, but they keep it together which is what working and raising a family is all about. So many people have been talking about this movie - all good! - and the movie left us wanting more. This would make a great series - appealing to many ages! - it would be so nice to see a real life, down to earth, family show like this that portrays the reality of so many of our lives today - instead of the so called \"Reality TV\" that all the stations are overwhelming us with these days.

Suburbia and its inhabitants aching for real communion, mostly unable to give or receive it...how well this movie expressed it!

When their owner, the wealthy elderly woman known as Madame Adelaide, realizes that her time is running out she decides to write up her will, leaving everything she has to her cats, which will then go to her butler Edgar when the cats pass on. Edgar overhears this and is deeply offended by the idea that the cats would get everything before him, and plots to destroy Duchess and her kittens; he drops sleeping pills in their supper one night and then leaves them stranded in the French countryside. Out of their element, Duchess and her kittens befriend a street smart stray cat known as Thomas O\\'Malley (voice of Phil Harris who did the voice of the big bear Balloo in the Jungle Book); after making a pass at Duchess, unaware that she is a single mother, O\\'Malley decides to escort them back home, with Duchess genuinely falling for O\\'Malley as the usual codependent surrogate family bond develops; chaos and mayhem ensues, culminating in a violent clash between O\\'Malley, his brother cats from the streets and Edgar. Also features appearances by British geese, American southern hound dogs (what they were doing in France is anyone\\'s guess), a mouse who sounds a lot like the rabbit from \"Alice In Wonderland\" (he was in fact voiced by the same guy who voiced Winnie the Pooh) and a horse. <br /><br />Sometimes slow paced but still enjoyable Disney venture. Features the memorable \"Everybody Wants To Be A Cat\" musical piece sung by the late Scatman Crothers (better known to 1980s fans as the voice of Jazz on Transformers).

One relatively forgettable but covering the same geography, is Coup de Torchon, the other thousands of miles away and much larger in scope is the unforgettable Indochine. Claire Denis has produced a movie that has some of the grand underpinnings of Indochine, the complex and unspoken relationship between France and her colonial subjects.<br /><br />I was struck with the dignity of Potee, with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses. I was also struck with the love/hate relationship between him and Aimee. It is the latter that gives the film its driving force, it is the latter that links this movie to Indochine.<br /><br />One never is sure what motivates everyone, though some of the characters are required of a remembrance of colonialism. It is this cynical side of the story that ties it to Coup de Torchon. Theirs is the more scandalous story, perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way, but Denis gives us a remembrance of how it was with all the tension and unresolved relationships.<br /><br />The American black who gives the grown up France a ride in the beginning and end of the movie offers yet another interesting side to the confusion that we in the Western world have when we look at Africa. He says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother. He was coming home, but they just thought him to be a little daft.

It has its problems (what movies don\\'t) but still, it\\'s enjoyable.<br /><br />When I stumble across someone who asks me why I like Titanic, I suppose my first reaction is \"wait a minute, you don\\'t?\" I know so many people who don\\'t like this movie, and I\\'m not saying I don\\'t see why. \"The love story is too cheesy\" well, yes but isn\\'t it enjoyable and moving? All right, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like this doesn\\'t actually exist. But this is a movie, doesn\\'t everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while? The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors. Well, OK, in this movie, I agree that they do not perform to their full potentials. However I think it\\'s unfair to say that they are terrible actors. I personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in. But the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit, but I agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected.<br /><br />And finally, if one is going to complain that they don\\'t like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then I\\'m sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things. It\\'s like people who complain The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. Simply for being a movie, not because you dislike the genre, this IS a good movie.<br /><br />Well deserving of its Oscars, in particular, Best Cinematography, which I find to be the best I\\'ve ever seen in a movie save maybe the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br /><br />I know some of the writing fails, such as the constant screaming of each other\\'s names throughout the movie. The flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it\\'s an amazing achievement in making the Titanic look so real, and the sinking feel so epic.<br /><br />I understand why a lot of people dislike this movie, but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea, such as it being a love story, rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed.<br /><br />I can tell you that I have read more than five books about the Titanic, including memoirs form the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults. The only main ones I can find is that the piping should be threaded copper, not steel, and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it.<br /><br />I give this movie 10/10, not because I like romance movies, but simply because it\\'s an outstanding cinematic achievement, that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events.',\n"," 'This movie has nothing to do with Robert Louis Stevenson\\'s Treasure Island.

Even though it\\'s a small low budget production, I can\\'t help but feel that Justin Lo wrote himself into the lead role just so he could make out with whoever was going to fill the role as the attractive drifter. The story was so dull and the acting so dry and 1 dimensional that I couldn\\'t watch this movie all the way through without taking breaks. Justin Lo, who was 23 at the time, and played a 19 year old in the movie wrote a script with dialog that read like a high school play. So try to imagine a few much older middle aged characters trying to deliver lines that sound like they were written by a 14 year old.<br /><br />The directing and camera work was bland and the only thing that kept this movie from being a complete flop was the involvement of Nick Bartzen who filled the role of that attractive drifter. Nick was the real star of this movie. He was able to emulate real emotions not only by his realistic delivery of dialogue, but also by utilizing his body language and facial expressions. So while I didn\\'t really care about this story, his acting in it makes me interested to see what other projects he\\'ll be seen in.<br /><br />The Conrad Boys was a nice try for first timer Justin Lo with good intentions, but I can\\'t really imagine what kind of group this movie was even targeted to appeal to.',\n"," \"Boris Karloff's name is what brought me to this picture, and without him, I think, the film might have been just another B movie programmer from the Forties. I've just learned a little about producer Val Lewton, and their collaboration here is what gives the picture some of it's momentum. While watching however, I never really got the impression that this was going to be much of a horror film. Yes, there's mention of evil spirits and malignant forces, and even a word about the dreaded vorvolaka, an undead vampire-like creature that's part of Greek folklore. But even with a mysterious Madame Kyra (Helen Thimig) professing such belief, and others in the story buying into it, the production makes it pretty plain that the reason folks are in danger is because of a plague that has infected the island. The attempt to link Thea (Ellen Drew) to malevolent forces didn't really work for me, she was just too wholesome and good looking to imply a serious threat. That role should probably have gone to Madame Kyra, perfect for someone warning about vorvolakas to actually be possessed by one.<br /><br />What works best I guess is the way General Pherides (Karloff) slowly unravels from a man of strong principal and belief in science to a mad man intent on eliminating a superstition come to life. It's that psychological aspect to the drama that holds more water than the implied horror component, even if Mrs. St. Aubyn escapes from her coffin. Enough explanation revealed her bouts with cataleptic trances and fear of being buried alive to make that an expected part of the story, and one would presume that that was enough to put her over the edge with the old Poseidon sword.<br /><br />Nevertheless the film is enjoyable on a number of levels; for one, lovers of old films will delight in the great ambiance of an isolated, wind swept island and the dark, moody atmosphere of the Albrecht home. The characters never wear out their welcome, and as others on this board have suggested, those that might have make an early exit.

Factual errors regarding church history and nomenclature abound. I can\\'t believe Hector Elizondo agreed to be a part of this. Maybe it was made without his consent, Bowfinger style. May the Lord have mercy on the director, the screenwriter, the author of the novel, and the poor souls who see the movie or read the book.',\n"," 'I have been wanting to see this since my French teacher recommend it to me over forty years ago. Perhaps the long wait was worth it, since the Criterion Collection DVD restoration is impressive.<br /><br />In its outline this movie follows the time-worn script: a quartet of men diligently plot a difficult heist of a bank vault, the heist takes place, a small seemingly insignificant event leads to the ultimate demise of all. Even though the heist footage is transfixing, it occurs rather early and is ultimately not at the core of the film. This film separates itself from the typical heist movie by giving us insights into the personalities of the characters and their motivations - its plays as much as a drama as it does a thriller. Relationships play a big role and a kidnapping is tacked on, giving us two movies for the price of one.<br /><br />John Servais plays the idea man Tony le Stéphanois (always referred to as \"le Stéphanois\") with such world-weariness that he could have just stepped out of a Camus novel. Tony has just recently gotten out of jail and resists re-entering the life of crime until he has a highly unpleasant interaction with his ex-lover (who has taken up with another man) where, as punishment, he physically whips her with a belt. Thankfully that scene occurs off camera, but you are not likely to forget it. After that sobering event, since there seems little hope of reviving that relationship, Tony meets with two of his old partners in crime, Jo and Mario, and decides to join them in one last big heist. They enlist the services of Cesar, an Italian safe cracker - played by director Dassin himself - and we are off to the heist.<br /><br />The heist goes off without a hitch. But Cesar\\'s womanizing bent is a personality trait that turns out to be fatal for all concerned. However, we can understand his attraction to the nightclub singer he has fallen for, since there is a brilliant set piece where she performs a sexy and cinematically inspired nightclub act - it has to be one of the most memorable scenes from any noir film.<br /><br />It is established early on that Tony has a close relationship with Jo and his family; in fact Jo\\'s son refers to him as uncle. I think it is partly to help Jo\\'s family that Tony agrees to the heist. The ending scenes, where Tony saves the life of Jo\\'s kidnapped son, partially redeems his more brutal and amoral actions. But only partially.',\n"," \"I've never understood why so many people seem turned off by this movie. Aside from some unnecessary uses of the 'S' word, this is a very original, very moving story that could even be of comfort to children who have lost a relative or friend.<br /><br />What's not to like? We have very positive messages here. Seeking and finding strength in faith, dealing with reality. The child actors are outstanding. Joseph Cross portrays his character so perfectly that it is at times very moving.<br /><br />A great supporting cast of Dennis Leary, Dana Delaney and Rosie O'Donnell (at her funniest, yet most reserved persona). Flawless directing by Shyamalan and a great score by Edmund Choi that has since been used elsewhere.<br /><br />A perfect little film with a big heart for anyone who's lost someone they loved.\",\n"," \"This film has a cult following, much like Stuart Gordon's Re-Animator or Sam Raimi's Evil Dead, but isn't close to entertaining as the two cult classics. I am a huge fan of cult films - I even enjoy such obscure cult flicks like Head of the Family and Don't Look in the Basement, so I was anticipating an enjoyable ride with Basket Case, but it didn't deliver. Everything about this film is bargain--basement, from the acting to the effects. The stop-motion effects are TERRIBLE. I realize this isn't Harryhausen, but low-budget filmmaker Brett Piper uses stop-motion quite well.<br /><br />The film tells the tale of conjoined twins - one little more than a head growing out of his fully developed brother's right side. His father hires a trio of quack doctors to remove the head, named Belial, from the body of the anatomically correct Duane. The doctors throw away Belial after removing him from Duane's side, but Duane picks his brother out of the trash bin and they go on a revenge murder spree, killing the doctors who separated them.<br /><br />STORY: $$$ (This isn't the problem. The story is interesting but everything else is muddled. This dialogue is bad and the effects are terrible. In more capable hands, this could have been the cult classic that some people proclaim it to actually be).<br /><br />VIOLENCE: $$$$ (There is plenty of blood in this film. The best scene is when Belial gets busy with a set of scalpels and plants them in the female doctor's face. If gore is your thing, then this won't upset, but if you like well written dialogue, then don't bother).<br /><br />ACTING: $ (Terrible, from top to bottom. There isn't a soul in this film with a shred of talent. The lead, Kevin Van Whatever, is in desperate need of acting lessons as is his love interest, Terri Smith, in her only film credit mind you. The doctors were poor actors and the people inhabiting the motel seemed plucked from off the streets).<br /><br />NUDITY: $$$$ (Plenty of it - men and women\",\n"," 'When people think of downtown Chicago they think of Walter Payton, Ditka and \"Da Bears\", Ryne Sandberg, The White Sox breaking the curse in 2005 or the immortal Michael Jordan and his six championships (and Finals MVP\\'s) with the Chicago Bulls. Rarely in this generation do people think of the struggling side of Chicago, the ghettos, the drug infested streets and life in the urban housing projects during the 1970\\'s.<br /><br />One of television\\'s most formidable shows ever and a groundbreaking sitcom was \"Good Times\", which I remember vaguely as a small child on CBS, and I enjoy regularly now on TV Land.<br /><br />\"Good Times\" was another Norman Lear classic, the producer that gave us \"The Jeffersons\", the best African American sitcom of all time and \"All in the Family\" the greatest show of all time. \"Good Times\" brought out the hardships of the ghetto and the urban housing projects, and did so with charm, well written and thoughtful plots, and some wonderful acting especially by the matriarch and patriarch of this struggling ghetto family played by Esther Rolle and John Amos. The children in the supporting cast were also pretty good especially the ever popular Janet Jackson in her early years and Ralph Carter as Florida and James Evans youngest son whose character at a young age realizes that life is unfair, and he has to learn to stand on his own two feet.<br /><br />The eldest of the children J.J. played by Jimmy Walker is somewhat out of place on this show and is there mainly for comic relief. His emotional age is about 11 or 12 even though he looks like a guy in his early twenties. J.J. gets annoying, and it is a credit to the often nasty James Evans (Amos) that he never tells J.J. to get his own life, get a job and get out of the house. J.J. is an aspiring painter but unlike his younger brother is never serious about getting a college degree, or more important to the family getting a job to help support a household that is just above welfare status.<br /><br />Two classic episodes of Good Times was the one where the Janet Jackson character is running a fever of 104, and Florida Evans is desperately seeking good medical help for her can\\'t afford anything but a clinic doctor who is very professional yet doesn\\'t want to give a family from the projects any more attention than she legally has to. The other episode is the one where James Evans can\\'t afford the rent a paltry low $104 a month. The Evans are about to get the largest of family setbacks, being thrown out of the projects with no where to go. Florida Evans goes downtown to the board of social services to try to get either a loan or a grant to help her family. But the government doesn\\'t consider her family poor because they have over $4,200 in assets for a family of five which is unfairly but unfortunately legally over the poverty line. James and the kids want to hustle for the money, but Florida is a person of great moral character and doesn\\'t want to do anything dishonest no matter how dire their predicament is. In the end the family does find a solution to keep their heads above water.<br /><br />\"Good Times\" a classic show from the 1970\\'s is about keeping you\\'re head above water in a cruel world. James and Florida Evans both work hard in menial jobs to try to bring their children up right and avoid the social stigma of welfare. I was too young to understand the message of the sitcom as a toddler in the 70s in its first airing on CBS, but I really enjoy the reruns on TV Land in 2006. \"Good Times\" is one of the classic sitcoms from back in the day.',\n"," 'There is a reason to call this a teen flick. Out of 100 possible points I would put it somewhere in the teens. It is predictable, the acting is horrible, especially the minor roles, and above all else it is super predictable. The ending is so hokey that I should have left early and maybe it would have passed. By the way, could you call the male lead a pervert? I bet if it really happened, someone in my school district would have said so. Finally, in the school I grew up in, even though the average class had over 1000 students, we could have picked out a chump like Josie as being a fraud and we would have singled her out of the crowd. My final word is save your time, when it comes on TV watch something better, like the stock quotes.',\n"," \"First of all, I would like to know why so many people are comparing Wyatt Earp to Tombstone. Yes...both films were made within a year apart, but their objectives are completely different. The titles pretty much say it. Tombstone is about the events that transpired in Tombstone...Wyatt Earp is about the man Wyatt Earp. Therefore, they do not have the same goal in mind and are telling two very different stories. I enjoyed both films for different reasons and allow them to stand on their own merits. Tombstone was more entertaining and action-packed, however, the story was not as historically accurate and the characters were a little over the top. Whereas Wyatt Earp had more of a personal, in-depth examination of the life, but not the legend, of Wyatt Earp.<br /><br />Now, lets get to the intention of this film. Wyatt Earp is suppose to be a story about the lawman, with the convictions and tribulations that shape him as a young boy up to old age. Unlike, Tombstone, which focuses on an array of characters with the plot leading up to a single event, quite historically incorrect, I might add. Yes...Wyatt Earp is cold, unforgiving, bitter, reserved, etc. However, he was not always that way, as his early life traveling with his family to California and marriage to Urella Sutherland, a woman he deeply loved, demonstrates. The turning point in the story is when Wyatt's beloved wife dies along with their unborn child. Wyatt lashes out and loses all reason to live. He becomes extremely self-destructive and sets about roaming the West with no real purpose at all except to die. His father slaps some sense into him and tells him to move on with his life. Eventually, he becomes a lawman and that is when we meet the mysterious and quiet Wyatt Earp that nobody likes. So...okay...Wyatt becomes reserved, quiet, and cruel, but it is not as if we do not know why. He was a man trying to survive in a harsh, brutal land and being a lawman did not make it any easier because he was always a target. He was plagued by external demons as well as internal demons, such as the bottle and a strong yearning, undying love for his dead wife. He was very human and this movie manifests that. Tombstone is fine for those of you that do not care for Wyatt Earp beyond the infamous fight at the OK Carroll or the lawman legend. However, if you can stand a more accurate, in depth character exploration of Wyatt Earp, without any pretensions, than this is a movie worth seeing.\",\n"," \"Well Wright may have made a gritty depiction of life around 1800 - as he so repeatedly and anally goes on about because of when it was written as opposed to published - but it is HIS not Austen's and shouldn't claim to be an adaptation.<br /><br />Mrs Bennett looks like a rural washerwoman. This is a pampered woman - they have servants (remember the book scene with the servant dressing the hair, etc)? But Wright portrays her with rough reddened skin all down her chest, rough hands and working in the kitchen. And the pigs wandering through! If he wants bucolic, he should try Tess.<br /><br />Mr Bennett - the script makes too cuddly and modern and ignored the weakness in him. The scene where he stops Mary playing is supposed to make you cringe - not pass in seconds. If it doesn't - don't include it.<br /><br />MacFadyen is very weak in the part and seems to be doing some kind of Pride by numbers acting. The first proposal he looks like a nervous schoolboy rather than a man overcoming his pride to make a proposal beneath his station. Most of his lines, he could as well be reading a shopping list.<br /><br />Lydia is awful. Completely over the top with excessive shrieking and skipping. Indeed, Knightley plays Elizabeth more like the giggling inane character Lydia actually is in the book, at times.<br /><br />And Elizabeth. Half the time Knightley is, clearly, mimicking Ehle's voice and intonation - close your eyes to see what a copy it is. And in her role you see Wright's major error - there is NO PREJUDICE.<br /><br />From the first encounter with Darcy she clearly fancies him. When he comments to Bingley on the attractiveness of the women in the hall she initially looks hurt - not shocked and affronted. The latter should set up the prejudice side of things. And when she and 'caroline' are prancing round the room she comes across like a tease, obviously all over him. And by virtually cutting out Wickham you don't get Elizabeth invested enough there to set up the prejudicial aspects falling out of that relationship.<br /><br />And apparently it is Caroline not Miss Bingley. And Mr Bingley happily wanders into Jane's bedroom. And and and - Wright can boast about how great he is with period all he wants. But a few panorama shots of rural life (which show the preference for Hardy) don't excuse him the glaring blunders all over the place.<br /><br />The cinematographer - who clearly wants awards - should have been reined in. He veered between Bronte and Hardy throughout the film - and wasn't the last proposal shots/lighting from Tess? The need to see Darcy walk along through the 'scape with unkempt shirt was just dumb. But most importantly - when going between those 2 very different landscapes they forget the most important one - Austen. (She'd have laughed out loud at the Elizabeth = sad, therefore = rain, running through to picturesque folly, wet Darcy rubbish).<br /><br />I admit I found it impossible the watch the film without using the book as context. I was prepared to give it some leeway as it had to provide the story in a short space of time. But to forget fully one half of the core of the book in prejudice and Darcy to continually look more constipated than prideful, made it almost unwatchable. I could only see it as a mess with generally poor performances (when Knightley wasn't aping Ehle she was gurning or skipping or both and only calmed down a couple of times to indicate she does have some promise - but faffing about on swings to convey emotion isn't a substitute for a poor script and poor direction) - although for some it was simply a case of bad script.<br /><br />Tom Holland alone would escape censure. While he toned down the comic aspects of Collins, he did turn in a very interesting approach. Dench does superbly the schtick she can do in her sleep whether it be here or in Oscar Wilde - but this was supposed to be Lady Catherine De Bourgh NOT Lady Bracknell. She was just a little too sane.<br /><br />The shortened length could have been handled by a competent screenwriter, surely? Not characters filling in story gaps and helping along the audience all over the place. Elizabeth couldn't have come up with the £10k figure. And while they wanted to cut time with her learning of Darcy's involvement in Wickhams marriage the lines didn't fit with Lydia. It was the worst case of incongruous exposition in the piece.<br /><br />It really is appalling stuff. Anyone who reviews it saying it works well in the context of the book is someone I frankly don't believe has read or understood the characterisations in the thing. Wright seems to think his characters are in the 1990s not the 1709s from their behaviour. I'm not convinced he has read the book - he certainly doesn't understand it. He doesn't understand Austen's acerbic wit or lightness of touch - he certainly made a dull plodding film out of it.<br /><br />What is possibly worse was the sad pathetic need of the chick lit lovers to need the 'I love you, I love yous' all over the place so they can sigh and get off on it. The fact that it has no place in a work by Austen is apparently irrelevant.<br /><br />Anyone who reviews it as a film alone? Well, more difficult for me except I would note the poor acting, the weak Darcy, and the gurning skipping inane irritation of the whole thing. If you are going to adapt you can change a lot - but if it loses the spirit and key motivations, then don't insult the book by taking it's title.\",\n"," 'Beautiful Peggy Ann Garner, not the plain little girl that played Francie in \"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\" is all grown up and plays the part of a female predator out to get her man in her first drama in living color.

I am not sure if this is a movie driven by sentimentality or worse, deliberate agenda, but certain elements of it made it impossible to immerse. It is supposed to portray a struggling immigrant worker community which tries to cope with the difficult realities of their life. That is a fine premise and it could have made for a gripping story, but the execution just made me alternate between getting annoyed and amused at the ridiculousness of it.<br /><br />Here we have a community of simple farm workers who migrated to the US in search of employment and who get used and abused repeatedly by evil white men. And when I say evil - I mean EVIL. All white people in this movie are sinful, racist, sadistic, abusive devils whose sole purpose in life is sexual depravity intertwined with exploiting the poor immigrants. It would be a sad story if it wasn\\'t so unintentionally grotesque and therefore hilarious.<br /><br />The portrayal of the immigrants is also a poster-worthy example of exaggeration except that it goes in the opposite direction. The immigrants are saintly, clean and could serve as ointment for boo-boos and ouies the world over. I couldn\\'t help but laugh when I saw these \"field workers\" presumably digging in the ditches all day with their notoriously clean clothes and chiseled hair cuts from a top notch hair salon.

They don't explain a damn thing and the plot is too convoluted to care. Instead you see how the writers using their now totally uninteresting storyline as an excuse to make all the good guys become the bad guys and vice versa. Do this enough times and you're going to loose an audience. It's like trying to keep a child with ADD interested with flashy magic. The little side adventures with the vortex guy or mind controller guy were completely uninteresting.<br /><br />There are many flaws with the script, but off the top of my head here's one: They build up Adam as this super powerful/influential guy and beside the healing ability they don't even explain how, and then he gets easily killed to make room for the next big villain.<br /><br />Cancellation is coming soon!

It's the night of Micheal's birthday & the last few guests are leaving his party, or so he thinks. Some of his friends have stayed behind including his best friend Tony (Juan Ignacio Aranda) & a girl from school whom he has the hots for named Alexandra (Gabriela Hassle). Tony, being an idiot, suggests that they hold a séance with a Ouija board he just happens to have, after some goading everyone agrees & the séance begins. Tony talks about a spirit named Virgil & asks him some stupid questions, everyone goes home & that's about that or so everyone thinks... The next day Micheal is late for class but everything is fine. However that night as Micheal is trying to sleep he has a vision, a vision of one of his friends named Debbie (Cecilia Tijerina) who was at the séance, being brutally stabbed to death by an unknown assailant. Oh, & for some unexplained reason Micheal's eye's turn red. At first Micheal thinks that it was just a hallucination but when he hears about Debbie's death & that of another one of his friends at the séance Peter (Mario Ivan Martinez) on the news he becomes convinced that his vision was real. While at school Micheal receives a warning in the shape of yet another vision, a warning which tells him Christy (Melinda McCallum) will be the next to die, Micheal must try & save Christy & his remaining friends who were present at the séance before this unknown source of evil kills all of them...<br /><br />This Mexican American co-production was written & directed by Ruben Galindo as Ruben Galindo Jr. & is one seriously bad film. The script tries to cross supernatural thriller with stalk 'n' slash horror & it predictably turned out to be a complete mess. Don't Panic is a painfully slow & tedious film to watch with only two murders for well over an hour of it's running time & lots of boring exposition & unnecessary character development for the rest of it. The dialogue is pretty bad, the acting is very bad & the character's are awful. The film tries to conceal the killer's identity & to be fair it might work, unfortunately the version I saw revealed the killer on the back of the video box so I knew who it was all along, I doubt it would be that much of a surprise though. No explanation is given to who Virgil is, what he want's, why he's killing these specific teenagers or how he is able to possess people's bodies. Virgil is just 'there' & we have to accept it. The character's are all stupid, the situations Don't Panic depicts are all stupid & as a whole the film lacks any sort of fore-thought or intelligence behind what's going on. The ending is awful as well, both how Virgil is defeated & that sickening & tacky 'this rose will never wilt as long as there is love between us' scene. Despite what you may have read there is actually very little on screen gore, two people are stabbed which Don't Panic depicts by having blood splash over the floor & on the victims clothes, there is a fairly decent slit throat even if I wouldn't just sit impassively in a car as someone stuck their hand in through the window & sliced my throat open with a knife & a scene in which a knife (it's the same knife in all the murder's actually) is stuck into someones chin & it protrudes from their mouth. All the kill scenes are dull with virtually no build up & director Galindo fails to inject any tension, scares or atmosphere into them just like the rest of the film in fact. There isn't even any nudity either, in fact when Micheal & Alexandra have sex it is squeaky clean stuff, Galindo merely shows them kissing each other on the lips while in bed. As mentioned already in other comments the sight of Micheal running around in his babyish pyjama's is both bizarre & very silly looking. Don't Panic is technically average, the cinematography is static & flat as are the production values in general & the horrible music seems very out of place. There are a couple of scenes where a face pokes out of the TV which is quite an impressive effect. Overall there is very little I can recommend Don't Panic by as it's a pretty terrible film all round really, maybe it's good for a few laughs & a decent slit throat but that's it. One to avoid unless it's VERY cheap & your VERY bored.\",\n"," 'Why is it that when a star reaches the top of the star chain, they ruin all the good work by making a bad movie? Burt Reynolds peaked, then started making dreadful Hal Needham car chase flicks. Arnold Schwarzenegger became the hottest property in Hollywood, only to invite derision upon himself with the appalling Last Action Hero.

I am stunned by how positive most reviews seem to be.<br /><br />There were some gorgeous shots, but it\\'s too bad they were wasted on this sinkhole of a movie. It might have worked if \"Daggers\" was purely an action flick and not a romance, but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle. There is no chemistry between either of the couples, whatever exists between Mei and her men seems to be more lust than love, and for the most part the dialogue is just silly. This may be just a problem with translation, but the frequent usage of the word \"flirt\" in particular reminded me of 8th grade, not head-over-heels, together forever, worth-dying-for love; I also felt we were beat over the head with the wind metaphor. The audience is given very little about the characters to really care about, and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole. I was wishing for a remote control to fast forward, I was slumped in my seat ready to snore, but mostly I just cringed a lot.<br /><br />*******spoiler*****<br /><br />Now, the icing on the cake. Or rather, adding insult to injury. The ending was truly one of the most horrible, laughable ones I have ever seen. The boys are having their stag fight and screaming and yelling and hacking at each other. Oh, and then it starts to snow. Randomly. Oh, and then Mei (dagger embedded in heart) suddenly pops up out of the weeds. Then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach it\\'s destination, even slowing conveniently midscreen to hit a tiny blood droplet. Wow, cool.<br /><br />Well, then Mei dies finally I guess because she threw the dagger that was lodged in her chest and bled to death. Jin sings, sobs, holds her body close, screen goes blank. I, and the people surrounding me, are chuckling. Not a good sign.<br /><br />Visually stunning, but ultimately a failure.',\n"," \"Lets get one thing straight. I know that the on the box the artwork at the video store may be a little misleading but we are watching a home-made movie. It's not The Shining, Psycho, or any other masterpiece. It was filmed at cedar lake in Oklahoma(I Think?). You can hear the locusts in the background. The scenery looks really good. The actors are extremely amature with regional accents but are using realistic dialog(realistic for a bunch of kids camping at the lake). There are thousands of bloopers throught the movie. One was a dead body who had one arm tied to a tree and the other holding on to a branch. This is one talented dead body. Another was a joint someone was smoking that didn't emit any smoke. I thought the story with the two 12 year olds was really funny. There is a so bad it's good element to this movie but the better elements are the 80's slasher themes.

I honestly could not tell you a single line from any song. It was very forgettable -- and rather contrived. For no apparent reason, a song would break out.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this was a good movie. It is nice to be able to go to a movie and not be assaulted by vulgarity or sexuality thrown in just to appeal to the masses.

It is very refreshing to watch a movie about a triad that does not end in disaster.<br /><br />I have identified as polyamorous all my life--even before the word was coined in 1990.

This small band must hold on to a fort located close to the Indian village until reinforcements arrive. The Indians know, all to well, that the small band is undermanned, and could be wiped out before the help comes.

The troopers that he takes with him to the small outpost are the dregs of the troop at the fort; they, in turn, have gripes or weaknesses that cause them to wonder if the captain hasn\\'t taken them out because of their general lack of devotion to a cause. Eventually, the captain and the small band confront the hostiles, and at the same time, each confronts his own flaw.

It is not that well-known. And the exact specifications are a secret. And why is it a secret: Well, why should they reveal it back then?? If they where in a space race with the Russians, then it would be VERY dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation.\" This is completely incorrect. There is (and was) no \"secret\" to radiation protection in Apollo. The design and construction of the Apollo Command Module has long been publicly available. It uses a lightweight \"honeycomb\" of aluminum and stainless steel. The entire outer surface (except the windows of course) is covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin, thicker on the bottom that faces forward during re-entry. These materials are actually *better* at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space (charged particles) than lead, which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like X-rays and gamma rays.<br /><br />Space radiation is a definite problem for *long term* space flight because of the risk of big solar flares. But it simply wasn\\'t a serious threat to the Apollo astronauts. The Command Module gave them pretty good protection during their brief (1/2 hour or so) passage through the Van Allen belts. They all carried dosimeters so we know exactly how much radiation they each received: no more than 1.5 rem, and usually much less.

Sylveser Stallone is on a funeral with his classy sunglasses and his designer suit. This all wants to look full of promise. It is already way to obvious. The director is still in the conviction that he can move his audience with these simple and obvious tricks. This does not work, at least not with a critical public that has seen some more movies. <br /><br />Sylvester Stallone plays the part of Jack Carter, performed before by Micheal Caine who stars in this movie as well. Jack Carter is mad because his brother has been culled by either Jeremy Kinnear (Alan Cumming) or Cyrus Paice (Mickey Rourke). He wants of course, as it behooves a real hero, immediate retaliation. He is going to scare Jeremy and Cyrus. Our stalwart fellow gets in his beautiful Cadillac, puts his gun in his pocket and drives to the victims he is going to take care of. Actually that is what the story is about. We should not forget the girl, performed by Rachael Leigh Cook.<br /><br />Almost everything about this movie is bad. The story is as shallow as a baby tub, the dialogs are awful and the acting is brazenly bad. Sylvester Stallone plays his worst part ever. Stallone must be either Rambo or Rocky, but not Jack Carter. This man is not able to express emotions. Throughout the whole movie he plays the tough guy, right in the middle however he is this sensitive man who can cry as well. I can't even remember why he actually cried, but it was about something silly. Stallone is a strong man who can run after bears and shoot with bazookas, but he is absolutely not apt to play a normal human being with feelings.<br /><br />The dialogs are horrible. It goes approximately like this: Doreen: Why did you leave when your mother died? Jack: Just because, what is your favorite color? Doreen: Pink, yours? Jack: Blue. Doreen: Why? Jack: Just because.<br /><br />The dialog is as thin as paper. When something is stated, the actors just do not go any deeper. The questions are answered briefly and then the dialog continues with another silly question.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke does, except for his muscles, not add anything to the movie. His dialog is shallow as well, he is the tough guy who should be removed by Jack 'the man' Carter.<br /><br />Of the actors are not culpable of the bad dialogs.

I was lucky enough to attend this film courtesy of tickets from Camp Blood. Upon entering the fully packed theater as loads of people couldn't get in that were eagerly awaiting the screening outside. It hit me, this is it and I'm so excited. Being that I am a huge horror fan and a gay man I have been eagerly awaiting this film for quite some time. A film that combines my lifestyle with the thrills I've become so accustomed to cherishing over the years. So as I sat down the films promotion manager came up and introduced the film. He said I'm so happy all of you could be here to see the movie, I hope all of you like it and if you do tell your friends. And if you don't just say it was challenging.

I can happily say that it was. After a silly beginning featuring two hot guys getting it on and getting murdered. It was off to meet our main characters. First up gorgeous pretty boy Eddie played by the Passions Dylan Fergus. He's the Jamie Lee Curtis of the film, the somewhat virginal victim. Throwing off sex and drugs in search of a bad boy hunk he saw at the local tattoo parlor. That bad boy hunk is Jake played by sexy as hell Bryan Kirkwood of The Forskaen a scruffy, tattooed, tough boy protecting a wounded heart. Than there are his friends Joey played by adorable Hank Harris of Pumpkin the naive twinkie cutie of the group swooning over a crush on a deliciously hot jock boy. Bisexual Chazz played by yummy poster boy Andrew Levitas of Psycho beach Party (Provolonie) your basic friendly but whorishly natured player. And finally last but not least there's the model Tobey whose dressed up as a drag queen for Halloween hoping someone will notice something about him besides his looks played by heartthrob Matt Phillips. But wait there's the villain shirtless, mostly in the dark with ripped six pack abs, a devils mask and love for decapitations and eye gouging played by the brutally handsome John P. Petrelli. Along they go on their escapade to the Halloween carnivale in West Hollywood. Hoping for fun and hot guys they end up being stalked and systematically slaughtered one by one by a pointless but amusing killer. And this film is just entertainment, it's fun. there's lots of eye candy, creatively brutal and gory death sequences and manages to generate a good amount of old fashioned suspense and laughs. It plays a lot like a Friday the 13th sequel with an all male cast. And all though this is a film about gay men it's not a gay film. This is a horror film cut and dry and any real horror fan won't have a problem admitting to it. It's obvious that it was done on a low budget, but despite the poor film quality the film is smart and energetic fully delivering on it's promises as a brutal horror film that features gay characters. Hopefully the film will make some sort of impact, from the audience reaction I think it has quite a future to look forward to. A definite big time cult movie.

Deftly touching on all, but not belaboring any one of these elements of bigotry and systemic injustices, we are given a real portrait of an unusual family who are revealed in their entirety, not entirely good, not entirely bad, really human. <br /><br />The performances of the main four characters are simply outstanding and raw, so much so that you begin to wonder if this really IS a documentary. The small supporting roles are all equally strong. A riveting film in all respects; here the art direction and filming styles really augment the gritty reality and emotional perspective of an edgy life in a difficult time and place.<br /><br />This is a morally complex film, not for children at all, not for those who do not like indie films.

Written by former Cheers scribers Bill and Cheri Steinkellner and directed by first-timer Timothy Bjorklund, the humor in Teacher\\'s Pet falls almost completely flat.

At least until now, and what an amazing movie this one is. I knew it was a rough crime drama going in, but being the first Cat. 3 I\\'ve purchased that\\'s been made recently, I wasn\\'t sure what to expect.<br /><br />A Cambodian hit-man goes to Hong Kong to knock off the wife of a judge, who is also a lawyer. Turns out, the Judge made the arrangements for the hit-man, because she was divorcing the judge, and threatening to take all his money. This is all known within the first ten minutes, so nothing is being given away. After the hit, the cops locate the hit-man pretty fast, but in trying to arrest him, several police officers and civilians are killed. He eludes the police and now the race is on to catch the guy, before he escapes back to Cambodia. This is a movie that never stops, and hardly gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath. Yes, it is very violent and intense, many cops are killed, as the hit-man proves very very hard to track, and take down when they do locate him. Along the way, the hit-man in trying to hide in a dump, finds a women being raped and mistreated by some man. He helps her, and saves her from the guy, and she persuades the hit-man to take her along with him in his escape. I loved this movie, it\\'s like a roller-coaster that just keeps moving and moving at high speed, as one incident leads to another, and the police at times are just as bad or worse as the hit-man. The acting is exceptionally good, and the location filming and photography is at time breathtaking. There\\'s no let up in this movie, not even with the very very incredible ending. The ending is pretty much unbelievable, and also a fitting end to all the action and violence.

Special effects aren\\'t stellar, but the director seems to be mostly competent enough to work around that weakness.<br /><br />The lead, a mildly charismatic male that seems to be attempting a blended channeling of Tom Cruise and Christopher Reeves, reminded me mostly of Matt Dillon\\'s character in \\'Wild Things\\'. The female heroine does an OK job, but does not distinguish herself in anyway. There\\'s a \\'naughty girl\\' role in here, and the actress does what she can with it, but it doesn\\'t seem like much. There is a child actor that the director can\\'t decide if he\\'s morose, cheerful or just weird. <br /><br />Pacing, as I said, is the worst problem with this movie, until a final battle with the bad guy that would make a Power Ranger blush.

So maybe I\\'m nuts and just really good at hiding it...but not only did I NOT come away from A Bug\\'s Life exhausted or dazed, it wasn\\'t until I saw it the second time that I could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visuals--because the first time I went to see this movie, I got so wrapped up in the story and the characters that I FORGOT that I was supposed to be sitting there being \"wowed\" by each frame visually. How can you not empathize with Flik and his road-to-heck-paved-with-good-intentions life? \"Heck\" indeed, I found myself identifying with that little ant (not to mention some of the other bugs) in a lot more ways than one...and that, in itself, says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy. Of course, it\\'s beautiful (every blade of grass, the tree, the rain...). Of course, what they can do with technology is amazing (you can read their lips! try it!). But this movie is not just a masterpiece of art and tech, not just an dazzling explosion of movement and color. No, A Bug\\'s Life would be static if it were all that and no story. But, I\\'m glad to say, it\\'s not! A Bug\\'s Life has real heart. Yes, there\\'s a lot going on, storyline-wise as well as visually, but that\\'s because the story and characters actually have some depth to them! Just because it\\'s a kids\\' movie doesn\\'t mean you should have to turn off your brain at the theatre door--kids are smarter than you think! Besides that, I think that the PIXAR crew made this for themselves, even before their kids...and it shows, in the amount of heart in has. This movie is moving, touching, funny, intriguing, and generally engrossing. The character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing, there\\'s a major amount of character growth, and not just of the main character--so rare in animation and often in movies in general. It doesn\\'t hit you over the head with its points once it\\'s made them--every scene, every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there, and there are no gratuitous shots. Not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety, to me, folks; it means not \"dumbing down\" your movie and assuming the audience is stupid, which it mostly is not. All I can think is, if you can see A Bug\\'s Life and not feel anything at all, then you must have never made a big mistake, hurt your friends, had a crush, fallen in love, been frustrated that no one would listen to you, lied to someone you care about, felt like a social misfit, gotten excited over a new idea, come up with a great idea, had what you thought was a great idea backfire, been awkward one moment and confident the next, felt the pressure of responsibility, stood up for yourself and your loved ones, stood alone against the crowd, felt like a failure, felt like a big success, felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others...well, you get the point. Final words: A+ rating from me; please, if you\\'re going to see it try to see it in the theatre (pan and scan video is NOT going to work for this movie); if you loved Toy Story you\\'ll most likely love this (PIXAR knows how to make movies with heart); if you do love it see it multiple times or you STILL won\\'t know what you\\'re missing (the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable); and whenever you\\'re feeling really low, just pretend it\\'s a seed, okay?',\n"," 'In a mysterious forest in Thailand, many suicidal youths disappear and rescue teams can not find the way out even with compass.

It tries to talk a more realistic approach, not focusing on the magic, but I think that it fails on that level. The King Arthur legend hasn't transferred to film that well. Firstly the film is well written or well directed. The casting was poor. Sean Connery was not a good choice for playing Arthur, they got a Scot playing an English King and even though I'm a Bond fan, Sean Connery is a particularly good actor after that. Richard Gere is the most wooden actor in history and just can perform. He shows no emotion and can't even be a good action hero, seeing that he doesn't tend to play action roles. He can't even do a British accent. The relationship between Guinevere and the two leads was not believable. I didn't like the fact an older actor playing Arthur and that the two characters are meant to be a similar age. It was also hard to believe the relationship with Lancelot because of Gere's performance. I also felt that Camelot was not grant enough. The whole point of the city was that not other city could match it for beauty and was a symbol of England's glory. The film was also not particularly loyal to the Arthur legends and this is another example of Hollywood butchering an English legend, similar to Robin Hood films.

There\\'s the judge\\'s \"chamber\" where decisions are made, and, at the other end, the gas \"chamber\" where those plans are executed along with the inmate to whom those judgments were passed down.<br /><br />In some ways, the title is the niftiest part of the movie. For John Gresham, whose intentions are always benign, it\\'s a pretty weak story. (It shouldn\\'t be, with William Goldman doing the adaptation.) It\\'s Gresham\\'s most pedantic. Condemned are both racist violence and the death penalty, the former more so than the latter.<br /><br />That\\'s the bothersome part of the plot. Okay, Gene Hackman does his best with the role of the lifetime KKK bomber who takes the rap for the real killer of the two Jewish children. But he\\'s miscast. Hackman is not an unreflective, defiant, redneck racist and murderer. JAMES WOODS is that character. Hackman is absolutely first-rate (without being a bravura actor) when he gets the right role, whether it\\'s villainous or heroic, but he\\'s never been good with accents and, man, does this role call for one.<br /><br />At that, he gives the strongest performance in the film, with support from a couple of seasoned players like Harve Presnell. Gresham\\'s relatively innocent young idealist, Chris O\\'Donnell, does not convince. He looks the part alright but his voice and gestures suggest a weakness that the character shouldn\\'t have. And he\\'s the main man. Some of the supporting players, like Bo Jackson as Sergeant Packer, can\\'t seem to act at all.<br /><br />The climax involves one of those detailed execution scenes I\\'ve come to loathe. I don\\'t understand why they\\'re there. In a short cinematic exercise in the early 1940s, Orson Welles used the first-person camera to guide the viewer into a gas chamber. Then, in the mid-50s, there was a detailed execution of Susan Hayward in \"I Want to Live.\" Then there was a hiatus for another twenty years or so before these tasteless scenes came back with a vengeance. Here we get to see Gene Hackman gassed to death, the foamy spittle dripping from his mouth as he expires. But what does this tell us? That execution is horrifying and painful? What else is new? So what do these scenes tell us that we don\\'t already know? I understand some TV channels are negotiating with Texas to film executions for broadcast. (How long before the opportunity to pull the switch is auctioned on eBay?) What kind of audience do the writers and directors think they\\'re addressing? <br /><br />The musical score is by Carter Burwell and it\\'s fairly conventional, full of deep and ominous chords. He\\'s a talented composer who has done quirkier work in better films like \"Fargo\" and \"The Spanish Prisoner.\" Judging from the movies that are based on his novels, John Gresham is in the not-uncommon position of being at odds with the values of the society he grew up in. A lot of other marginalized writers have also been prompted to explain the sins of their culture\\'s past to the rest of us, beginning maybe with Nathaniel Hawthorne and running through the Southern giants of American literature and playwriting -- Tennessee Williams, Faulkner, and the rest. Gresham fits the mold and his work is interesting, but this is a failed effort. The legal aspects are confusing, the characters a bit muddled, and the story itself either too simple or too complex, depending on how you look at it.',\n"," 'The writers get no points for creating a cohesive or logical plot. It\\'s all over the place. A guy creates a worldwide spying device and then he\\'s killed in an attempt to steal it. Years later his two daughters use the device to become hired assassins and get away with all their crimes. One of the sisters falls from some Korean sex symbol and decides she wants to stop killing people for money. The other sister wants to keep going and so she tries to do a job on her own and she screws up. There\\'s a rookie cop who pretty much figures it all out and she\\'s hot on the sisters\\' trail. One of the guys who paid for a hit decides he wants to wipe out the sisters and the cop and then it\\'s all kicking and shooting and wire fu for the last exciting 20 minutes or so. Like I said, the story is pretty poorly put together but you will enjoy almost every moment any of the sisters or the cop is on the screen. Karen Mok is brilliant as the tough, smart, sassy and sexy cop. Shu Qi and Vicki Zhao make for the cutest sisters you\\'ll ever see on screen. Whenever any of these characters are fighting with good guys, bad guys, one another or each other, you will be amazed at the stylized kung fu artistry. Yes, there\\'s a lot of wires and camera trickery but it never takes away from the enjoyment. And how many movies can turn \"Close To You\" into a action theme? Don\\'t watch the English dubbed version if you can avoid it. Watch it either in Mandarin or Cantonese for full enjoyment.',\n"," 'Yes, this IS a horror anthology film and it was a lot of fun! That\\'s because although the film clearly was horror, some of the stories had a light spirit--and there were even occasionally a few laughs. This isn\\'t at all a bad thing as sometimes horror films are a bit stuffy and overly serious. Because of this and because all four of the stories were pretty good, it\\'s one of the better movies of this style I have seen.<br /><br />The unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself. Four different stories involve people who either rent the home or investigate what happened to the tenants.<br /><br />The first segment starred Denholm Elliott as a horror writer who has writer\\'s block. So, for a change of scenery, they rent this house. Almost immediately Elliott\\'s block vanishes and he works steadily on a tale about a serial killer. Amazingly, soon after his block vanishes he begins to actually see his fictional character! Again and again, the psychotic killer appears and then disappears--making it seem as if he is losing his mind. This might just be the best of the stories, as the nice twist ending makes the story come alive.<br /><br />The second, while not bad at all, is probably the weakest. Peter Cushing plays a bachelor who is pining for a girl friend who died some time ago (though the picture of her looked amazingly contemporary). When he enters a chamber of horrors wax museum in town, he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost lady and he is both fascinated and scared by this. Later, a friend (Joss Ackland) visits and he, too, sees the figure and is entranced by it. This all leads to an ending that, frankly, was a bit of a letdown.<br /><br />Christopher Lee then stars as an incredibly harsh and stern father to a pathetic little girl. During most of this segment, Lee seemed like an idiot, but in the end you can understand his demeanor. Though slow, this one ended very well.<br /><br />The fourth segment was the silliest and was meant to parody the genre. Jon Pertwee (the third \"Doctor\" from the DR. WHO television series) is a very temperamental actor known for his portrayals of Dracula. However, nothing is right about the film according to him and in a fit of pique, he stomps off the set to find better props for this vampire film. It\\'s actually pretty interesting that he played this role, as it seemed like a natural for Christopher Lee who played Dracula or other vampires a bazillion times (give or take a few). I enjoyed Pertwee\\'s line when he basically said that Lee\\'s and other recent incarnations of Dracula were all crap compared to Bela Lugosi\\'s! Perhaps this is why Lee didn\\'t take this part! Despite some very silly moments, it was very entertaining and fun--possibly as good or better than the first segment.<br /><br />Considering that the film started and ended so well, had excellent acting and writing, it\\'s hard not to like this film.',\n"," 'Art School Confidential is a simply terrible movie built from a script that needed dozens of rewrites before it would\\'ve been coherent. How Clowes went from creating such a lovely screenplay as Ghostworld to churning out this desperate schlock is beyond me, but it\\'s clear that something went terribly wrong in this, his second collaboration with director Terry Zwigoff. It\\'s apparent that they needed to rag on art, understandably, but the two must have been very hard pressed for a project to attempt this. Watching it, I was embarrassed for them.<br /><br />The cast is wasted. Angelica Huston, far and away the most talented actress in the film, is in all of two scenes. Why is she even in this movie? Malkovich\\'s performance as Professor Sandiford is entertaining enough, but the character is totally inconsistent. The main character, Jerome, played by Max Minghella, is hopelessly naive and unlikable. Minghella tries his hardest, but I wanted more to see Jerome get slapped than to see him succeed. After ogling love interest, Sophia Myles, from across the room and then briefly meeting her, Jerome starts calling her his girlfriend. Huh? Where did this kid come from? There are myriad unbelievable, sometimes cliché developments like this which only confuse the viewer.<br /><br />What is the intent? Did they set out to make a dark comedy, a farce, or what? The prat-falls and attempts at slap-stick negate any value it might have had as commentary on the art world. The plot is labored and full of holes, the comedy is lame at best, and the so-called \"twist\" at the end is a cheap trick which bundles up dozens of loose, frayed ends.<br /><br />Not since Crash has a movie so enraged me.',\n"," 'I have never seen such terrible performances in all my life.<br /><br />Everyone in the entire film was absolute rubbish.<br /><br />Not one decent actor/actress in the whole film, it was a joke.<br /><br />Reminded me of drama at school...',\n"," \"Never having seen an Oliver Stone film before, nor any films starring Eric Bogosian, I didn't know what to expect from this film. Having toyed with the idea of buying it for a while, I finally got it for free as a supplement with a Sunday newspaper and I was hugely impressed.<br /><br />It tells the story of Barry Champlain, a talk radio host who can be incredibly rude towards his callers, often putting them in their place before they realise what's going on. Though this is what has made him a popular radio show host, it has also earned him numerous enemies.<br /><br />The acting in this film was hugely impressive with not one dud actor in it. Eric Bogosian is brilliant as Barry Champlain, the troubled talk radio host with Alec Baldwin turning in a strong performance as Barry's boss, Dan. It also features the voice of, and cameo appearance by, Michael Wincott (my reason for wanting to see this).<br /><br />The story was really well written as, despite his arrogance, you feel for Barry as more about his troubled life is revealed and you see how vulnerable he really is.<br /><br />I'd recommend this film to anyone as it is captivating and, more importantly real on numerous levels, two of which being that is was inspired by the life of an actual talk radio host and the fact that you do actually get radio show hosts, and callers, like the ones featured in the film in reality.<br /><br />High recommendation and 10/10.<br /><br />Aye yours, Cat Squire\",\n"," \"This cheapo exploitation flick is some genuinely insipid stuff, courtesy of spaghetti land director Lamberto Bava, who wisely left his name off this junk.<br /><br />The basic crux of this outing concerns the discovery of some brutally mutilated individuals being washed-up on shore in the Caribbean. Authorities initially believe them to be victims of shark attacks, but as the investigation unravels, turns out to be something much more sinister.<br /><br />All of this ultimately amounts to very little however, we have here - poor dubbing complimented by similarly weak script, which often consists of nonsensical jabbering, and is really of little consequence for the most part. Acting can only be described as sub-par, which is par for the course in this instance. Truly lax direction doesn't help things either.<br /><br />Special effect mainly is for numerous close-ups of various gory bodies missing limbs, and so forth. Of course, there is the obligatory creature which periodically emerges at feeding time, which looks something like a big monster octopus thing, where its animation only consists of its pointed teeth ascending and descending in rhythmic articulation. Overall, the end result is none too convincing, sure, but admittedly is almost entertaining in a cheesy kind of fashion.<br /><br />It seems what the film makers were going for was a sort of low-rent hybrid of Jaws and Piranha, but the final product is just a bloody shambles, much like the corpses incessantly shown throughout this picture. I find it difficult to think of any redeeming attributes to warrant viewing this, so moreover, strictly for incurable monster movie addicts.\",\n"," \"This is a very funny movie, with hilarious performances from a host of famous Australian comedians, especially Kevin Harrington, HG Nelson, Micallef and Brian Dawe (of the Clarke-Dawe interviews series on '7.30 Report). I'm very surprised by the film's low score on IMDB. As some critics pointed out at the time of the film's release, the scene between Micallef and John Singleton (Micallef's fake political ad) is just about the funniest thing I can remember seeing in an Australian comedy. The film copped some flack when it came out, but I think most of that was tied up with the very bad rap most Australian comedies got in 2003. There was also a bit of controversy when the film was chosen to open the Sydney Film Festival (a pretty snooty affair usually reserved for 'arthouse movies'). Over time, I really hope this one will be up there, with 'The Castle', 'Big Steal' and a few others, as a classic example of laid-back, Aussie comedy. If you get a chance, don't miss it!

I had been watching movies all day for two days (thank you Jolt Cola and Continental Breakfast coffee) at this point, and WWHTKB stood out for a few reasons as one of my favorite movies from the festival. The main storyline, though contrived at points, kept a consistent mix of cynical humor and sarcastic wit with downright impossibly ridiculous situations and an extremely unlikely cast of characters - including \"Bitch,\" the main character\\'s abusive ex-girlfriend - that had me laughing out loud more than a few times. There were a lot of things outside of the main storyline that stood out as downright hilarious concepts, such as the fake John Travolta film, \"Oh Shenannigans!\" from which they show clips. Though these elements made me chuckle, they really don\\'t stand out from the entire genre of late-teen-college-age movie as something original. What really stands out from the film is the high amount of action that happens within the scenes, but having no real interaction with the plot. For example two movie theater clerks poke holes into paper cups and get kinky with the popcorn tubs while two main characters talk about going out to the improv later that night. This is the kind of movie that is best watched with a couple of drinks and some good friends that you\\'ve gotten up to some fun with.

Denzel Washington has given us some of the best performances of the last decade, as a black soldier in the Civil War in Glory, and a lawyer in the acclaimed Philadelphia. And of course, he made special notoriety last year when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in Training Day, in which Denzel Washington became the first African American to receive the award for Best Actor. I guess Denzel wanted a change of pace, so he chose to direct Antwone Fisher, in which he also stars. Fisher is played by Derek Luke, who is new to the silver screen, but has made some guest appearances on such television shows as King of Queens, and he will be appearing in the upcoming film release of Biker Boyz.<br /><br />\\tThis is a truly well done film from Denzel Washington, considering it was his first time directing. Undoubtedly, Denzel felt some kind of commitment and believed in the real life story of Antwone Fisher. Antwone Fisher is about a young African American man in the Navy who constantly gets into fights, and after one particular brawl he is sent to see a Navy psychiatrist named Jerome Davenport, played by Denzel Washington. Davenport helps Antwone to deal with his troubled past and learn to move on with his life, by finding his birth mother who had to give him up at birth because she was in prison. What makes this film good is the fact that it's not overly melodramatic. I was expecting something a little more like Good Will Hunting, with a lot of swearing, fighting and vulgarity. Not that I didn't like Good Will Hunting, or the swearing, fighting and vulgarity of the film were out of place. Quite the contrary! However, Antwone Fisher is a true story, and I don't think that Washington wanted to sensationalize the story for dramatic affect in the film. Don't get me wrong, there are moments when we see Antwone fighting, carrying on and having moments when it seems like the world is closing in on him. After all, in his first session with his psychiatrist, the character played by Washington, Devenport asks Fisher where he was born, and Fisher's response is, `from under a rock,' an obvious jab at the pressures waning on Antwone Fisher's soul. But I had to appreciate the fact that this film wasn't sensationalized for dramatic affect. I think it shows real character on the part of Denzel Washington to deliver a more realistic story and to avoid the typical clichés that are common in Hollywood films, even those based on true stories. One other point that I would like to bring up about Antwone Fisher is the acting. Over all, performances were good in the film, but not great. At times, I think it was a bit obvious that the main characters were actors, but overall, to complain about performances in this film would be ludicrous. One actress that I would like to point out in this film is Viola Davis. She plays Antwone's mother, but she says barely two sentences in the movie at all, but not so much because she appears at the end of the film, but more because she in shock that her long lost son, Antwone has found her. What I would like to point out about her as an actress in the lack of use of her. She in basically a character actress, and I haven't seen her play any really elaborate roles. She made appearances in Traffic, Out Of Sight, Kate & Leopold, and two recent films: Far From Heaven and Solaris. In Steven Soderberg's remake of Solaris, she played a scientist on a doomed space craft orbiting a planet. In that film, she is confronted by George Clooney's character and she drawn to tears by what Clooney tells her in a particular scene. When I first saw Solaris, I remember seeing her tear up in the scene and thinking, wow, this woman can act. It was as if you could feel the character's grief. In that brief shot of her face, she gave so much expression and I honestly felt very sorry for her character's sadness and trouble in the film. I think she has definite potential as an actress and should be used more often perhaps in leading roles, rather than just as a character driven actress. Nonetheless, Antwone Fisher is a very good movie. Denzel Washington, as always, pulls off a great performance and he gives us a great directorial debut. Also, Derek Luke is a very talented actor. I think that Antwone Fisher will bring his immense critical fame for his portrayal of the troubled man, but I think that his public popularity will increase with the release of Biker Boyz, which also stars Lawrence Fishburn. Antwone Fisher is based on the book `Finding Fish: A Memoir,' by Antwone Quenton Fisher. ***\",\n"," \"Addams Family Reunion is the weakest entry of the three films, but it is better than the awful TV series(New Addams family). The other two films were truly excellent, and seeing that most of the crew were replaced, it was obvious it was going to be a failure. The worst scene was the scene with the postman, that was just cringeworthy beyond belief. Tim Curry is a brilliant actor, and he is the only actor I can forgive for being here. Raul Julia had died, so it was perfectly natural for him to be replaced. Tim Curry did quite well as Gomez, but Raul Julia was easily the better Gomez in terms of spirit and charisma. Curry looked a bit uncomfortable at times especially in that awful purple pinstriped suit they made him wear, but he had the best lines that at least he made some effort with. Daryl Hannah tried hard,giving an equally spirited performance, but she is too beautiful for the character. I also thought she was too young for Morticia. These two are really talented actors(I have genuine respect for them) and sometimes you find an actor that has a role that doesn't suit them , evident here. Patrick Thomas was just embarrassing. Christopher Lloyd was born to play Fester and Thomas badly overacted. None of his actions were reminiscent of the original Fester. The children weren't very good either. Nicole Fugere was bearable, but she rarely uttered a word, and her stare felt rather unpleasant. Jerry Messing was awful, so annoying. He was too big and too loud. To say the cast were entirely to blame is very unfair, believe me the script was so poor, I'm surprised the actors weren't shaking with embarrassment. One of the few bright spots was the brief chemistry between Tim Curry and Ed Begley Jnr, bringing back fond memories of Tales of the Crypt, when Curry played three members of a family, with Begley playing a salesman. The most embarrassing moments were the Jeffrey and Melinda scenes in the mansion, who served no real purpose to the poorly thought-out plot. That said, the director is entirely to blame for the failure of this movie; he had no idea how to direct them. The script was repulsive, really childish, and should have a razzie for worst screenplay. And the special effects were poorly executed. There was good chemistry between Curry and Hannah, who tried their best, with the poor material. The dance routine was quite interesting, although I have seen Tim Curry dance better in films like Annie and RHPS. I would've loved to have heard Curry sing, for he has a great singing voice, because Raul Julia sang a Mamooshka in the first movie. In conclusion, an embarrassment, but not the worst movie ever. 4/10 for the efforts of Curry, Hannah and Begley. Bethany Cox.\",\n"," 'I should have listened.

Thank\\'s a lot, Nick Milliard. 1/1',\n"," \"I should preface this review by saying that my husband and I both have advanced degrees, and we see 50+ independent films a year. So filmic subtlety is not lost on us. We drove for an hour through horrendous traffic to see this highly-rated film, yet this is the only movie in 25 years of adult moviegoing that we have ever walked out of. It reminded me of the worst excesses of 60's French New Wave. Long stretches of people staring. Long stretches of silence and monosyllables. More long stretches of loud noise and incomprehensible voices. Short cut-in scenes that advanced the story (what there was of it) and characters not a bit. We get it; we get it--these people are ALIENated. Big deal.<br /><br />Can I care about two people who are supposed to be intelligent, yet they can't think of a thing to do to amuse themselves in one of the world's major cities? Can I believe in a young woman who's supposed to be a recent philosophy graduate of Yale, who can't think of anything to do with her time but stare out the window of her expensive hotel? Can I believe this same young woman came to Tokyo with her working husband, yet seems totally at a loss when he actually leaves to work? Can I believe that someone who is interested in philosophy so much that she majors in it in college can only be happy bar hopping, dancing, smoking weed, and singing karaoke? Can I believe that a faded Hollywood star who is being paid 2 million dollars for a commercial would come to Tokyo absolutely alone, without even an aide of any kind?<br /><br />And most of all, can I call a film that does nothing more than follow these two hapless and uninteresting people around for several days without a trace of drama or art profound?<br /><br />I think not. Don't waste your money. This is one of those rare instances when I can only conclude that there is some vast critical conspiracy to hoodwink the American public. Surprise! The emperor has no clothes.\",\n"," \"What's most surprising about this film is the date, 1955. It is a nice criminal detective comedy since all ends well that had started very grimly and so bad. If we take this film like all films by Hitchcock should be taken, that is to say as a metaphor of real life, of history, of fate, then we might be less surprised by the date. After all the worst is gone, is behind. The war is finished, the second world war and the Korean war, and even McCarthy is dead and buried, politically I mean. We can breathe. The future is clear. The complications are all behind. We are finally getting out of this dark hole in which we had been buried for a long time. The famous post war thirty glorious years and its baby boom generation are starting to bring in the fruit of our suffering, sweating and efforts if not travail. What we have produced is being bought by some millionaire. Our work is recognized and valorized. We are going to be famous, great, rich, beautiful, who knows what else. So we can bury the past. We can un-bury it, and then bury it again, and eventually un-bury it a second time, but why not re-bury that poor past in order to finally get it out once more and discover it was not so bad and it was nothing but some kind of sad heart disease, a disease of the heart, a weak heart crushed by passions, love passion, dreams that me made into nightmares, and maybe some anger. But the film is surprising because Hitchcock manages to have absolutely no staircase, no flights of steps, with or without mezzanines, and yet don't believe me that easy because it is not flat country indeed. And so up they go and down they go, the roads and the tramps, and all the other people in that village, uphill and downhill, upstage and downstage, upriver and downriver, up the strokes and down the strokes to paint and paint and paint reality till no one recognizes it or sees it. And if it were not enough to constantly go up and down lanes and paths and trails and tracks, you go up and down into and out of the ground, you dig out and fill up and dig in and refill up and dig out again and fill up a third time and dig up this time and fill down for the last time. All that vertical movement around a man who is dead and lying horizontal in the middle of the auburn and russet leaves of the fall. Hitchcock is still with us. And he is all the more with us because he explores the psyche of the human species. When they meet with death, their first reaction is to feel guilty for a crime they assume at once they have committed. Paranoid species. Then they feel relieved because someone else assumes the crime they have committed till they feel guilty again and reveal their own doing in the crime. Neurotic, psychotic and schizophrenic, all in one same species. But then they try to forget and wipe it out to go on with the present and their lives. But that is to no avail because life is stronger than illusions and death is even stronger than life. So the crime comes back because it has to be brought out and registered for the life of the living to be able to go on. And it is then that it is all revealed that human beings are as dumb as my thumb and instead of having thought and thought again and pondered, they jumped to conclusions without even thinking one second. And it is the crazy doctor who trips on cadavers all the time and beg their pardons for having disturbed them who finds out all that death was natural and the hullabaloo was nothing but a mid summer night's dream in the middle of the fall. In other words Hitchcock is questioning us on the real value of life when death is no longer a crime. There seems to be little left in life if that is the case. Crime and murder are the real spices of life which is so banal and tasteless otherwise.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines\",\n"," 'Charlotte Beal arrives at an isolated country mental hospital to become a full-time nurse there.

My husband and I were the ONLY people watching Dragon Wars last night! Now we know why.<br /><br />The movie was by far one of the worst I\\'ve ever seen. Yes, the CG was good, but that was it. The acting, script & dialog, directing, editing, etc. was God-awful! Since we were alone in the room, we felt free to talk during the movie. That is, we talked about how bad it was, that it reminded us of The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Godzilla, Mortal Combat AND The Lord of the Rings. It was like we expected to see Rita and Lord Zed portraying commanders of Sauron\\'s army.<br /><br />The creatures were ridiculous. You can\\'t just introduce legions of dino/dragon/lizard things loaded down with cannons without explanation. The Lord of the Rings has a wide spectrum of characters, but it introduces and develops them over 3 movies, not in an hour and a half.<br /><br />The scene transitions are horrible. I didn\\'t fall asleep during the movie, but even though it was an overly simple plot, I found myself getting lost in the plot holes.<br /><br />The characters were caucasian Americans, but spoke almost with broken English because of the badly written dialog in the script.<br /><br />The final scene that could have redeemed some value of the movie...failed. Ethan didn\\'t cry when Sarah died...though he hadn\\'t known her for very long during THIS life anyways. He didn\\'t seem too upset to be left in \"Mordor\", not knowing where he was or how to get back. We couldn\\'t for the love of God figure out where he was or how he got there either, but if he wasn\\'t upset we shouldn\\'t be either.<br /><br />Oh, and why did the dress that Sarah\\'s spirit was wearing look like she borrowed it from Queen Elizabeth? One more thing...all 3 of the main hero characters were reincarnations brought back to finish the job. Sarah completes her task and moves on to the afterlife. Jack does this as well. Then why does Ethan get screwed? He\\'s left alone, without the girl, without a map/compass/helicopter to help him get back. What\\'s he supposed to do? Send smoke signals? And IF he gets back home, does he just go back to his job? He should have been given the same mercy of getting killed out of the movie that the other heroes had.<br /><br />Don\\'t waste your time or money on this movie.

The movie has more than its share of glaring plot holes\\x97 some reviewers warn against examining all plot elements too closely. This is an indulgence I will (reluctantly) respect since the movie, in my opinion, has a much more serious and grating problem.<br /><br />What I found off-putting about the movie is that, except for Diane Venora\\'s brief role as Bryan Brown\\'s girlfriend, there is not a sympathetic character to be found anywhere. Brown\\'s character\\x97the heart of the story after all-- starts off a likable \"everyman.\" but becomes increasingly less so as the story proceeds until he devolves into a cold-blooded killer, indifferent to the carnage he is creating around him\\x97- not every federal agent has to die-- and corrupt, too. In the van chase scene, he is oblivious to the public menace he is causing in using his f/x tricks. (This could have been mitigated with a single line of dialog or a look of concern; but, never mind.) I wanted to like Martha Gehman\\'s character as Brown\\'s assistant, but she lost me with her gleeful \"I wish I could have seen the look on his face\" when she tricked the pursuing detective into thinking he had run over a woman. Finally, the transformation of Brian Dennehy\\'s character into just another corrupt cop left me with a distinct sour taste at the end of the movie. After everything is said and done, for Brown and Dennehy it\\'s all about the money. Even Schwarzenegger was never this cynical in his movies. The last thing that bothered me is that I always presumed movie special effects were to keep the actors safe.

Most of the characters actions and reactions rang true. There was some good humor, particularly regarding the dog.<br /><br />The dab of history laid out in the storyline was tantalizing. I suspect that there is some grain of truth to Lillian's recounting of pertinent historical events.<br /><br />I think that Wilford Brimley contributed greatly to the success of the story.

He brings such gravitas and authenticity to everything he does that the viewer encounters absolutely no difficulty suspending disbelief as necessary to embrace fully the storyline.<br /><br />The locations were fantastic and the cinematography was inspiring.

All that is desirable in this movie is the opera, and one can best find a recording of Pavarotti doing what he does best. The plot revolves around a romance with a doctor who heals his throat which has suddenly become troublesome. <br /><br />Only because it came out so long ago is it largely forgotten. Like most opera stars, Pavarotti is a decent actor and has stage presence aside from his singing talent, and nothing that he does in this movie negates that opinion. His culpability lies in not rejecting the horrid script. Perhaps because great operas can have silly stories he tolerated this one.<br /><br />Who knows, except those involved? Do we need to know? <br /><br />The plot is weak and trite. This movie is like trudging through cold mud to pick off a few juicy tidbits (the opera music) hanging above the mud. We have other ways in which to appreciate the great Pavarotti, and this one isn't one of them. Just get one of his many superb opera or vocal-concert recordings and recognize the master tenor where he is most suited.<br /><br />It would be one of IMDb's 100 Worst Films if more people remembered it and gave it some votes; it would fit neatly in a list including several efforts of singers, actors, models, and athletes to exploit their popularity through film.

However effective he is as an actor (opera requires it), not even Jimmy Stewart could have rescued this turkey of a script.<br /><br />I give it a polite 3 of 10 because someone may have become a fan of Pavarotti's singing and of opera because of this movie.\",\n"," 'I am a big fan of British films in general but especially gangster movies.

There is a narrator who prattles on about relationships, but his talking adds absolutely nothing to the mix at all and just adds to the confusion. As for the stories themselves, well.. I swear I have not got a clue why this movie got an 18 certificate in the UK, which would bring it into line with the likes of Nightmare On Elm Street and The Exorcist. Nothing here is even remotely scary.. there is no gore, sex, nudity or even a swear word to liven things up, this is the kind of thing you could put out on Children\\'s TV and no-one would bat an eyelid.

A woman thinks she has found the perfect man through a computer dating service.. that is until he starts to act weird.. And there you have it. Some of them are pretty amusing due to their outlandish premises (my favourite being number 2) but you get the feeling they were meant to be a) frightening and b) morality plays, unfortunately they fail miserably on both counts.

Avatar is grade A crap. That's right, it's crap.

Ask yourself this one question: If it didn't have the effects, the Navi plugging their hair into the trees like it's a damn broadband jack, mech suits(just like the ones in Matrix Revolutions) and barely futuristic ospreys, would you care about this movie at all? It's a truism when they say this movie is nothing more than Dances with Wolves in space.

The Death Star? Outer space? A location that has NOTHING at all to do with Earth? This important set of points clearly differentiates Star Wars and Hidden Fortress. But The difference between Avatar and Dances with wolves is... CGI. This CGI may be pretty but it cannot ever substitute for story and plot development. Speaking of, the characters save but a few are either very bland or stereotypes. The worst part is the story and the movie gives us no reason to care about the characters. You know what? I'll go one step further and say that the only difference between Avatar and a Star Wars prequel is this: Avatar has an environmental story that we can relate to. That's it. True, the action scenes in Avatar are well done, but hell, the action scenes in the Star Wars prequels were also arguably well-done. Still, there's that nagging lack of story development. Avatar is a huge let-down and doesn't belong on the best-of list of anybody with common sense.\",\n"," \"Okay, like many other such films, spawned out of a SNL skit.

It\\'s laid out much too clearly to ignore, and it is obscene because it has lost its sense of what it\\'s about. I haven\\'t read the novel, but Pollack\\'s film opens with a scene at a CIA-front organization in New York, which is broken into by two professional assassins, headed by Max von Sydow, who proceed to brutally slaughter the half dozen quirky staff members we\\'ve come to know and understand. The staff include an elderly female receptionist, a fussy elderly professorial guy who\\'s toupee falls off when he is machine-gunned (is that a joke?), and, last, the beautiful Tina Chen who looks up from the copier, realizes she is about to be murdered, and says, pitifully brave, \"I won\\'t scream.\" Von Sydow replies sympathetically, \"I know.\" These murders are completely unexpected, savage, unmotivated by anything that we are aware of, and graphic. It is a brutal scene. <br /><br />There is absolutely no way in which von Sydow and his henchman can be redeemed. And yet that is exactly what Pollack tries to do towards the end.<br /><br />After having killed these innocent good guys, von Sydow switches sides (because the other side is willing to pay him) and assassinates the evil mastermind behind a complicated intramural CIA plot. The script then turns him into a perfectly reasonable, sensitive human being. \"It is better to live in Europe. Things are not so rushed.\" Or whatever. I swear I\\'m not making this up. Pollack wants us to believe that it is better to be an honest mass murderer than a crooked bureaucrat. That\\'s the message. You should write it down in case you forget. Just exactly what kind of psychiatric shambles do you have to be in order to turn ordinary values, not to mention common sense, upside-down like that? I understand that there are thoughtful adults who dislike the government of the United States, even hate it, and who see conspiracies just about everywhere, providing a knee-jerk explanation for otherwise unexplainable events. I know that people who think this way exist because I number some of them among my closer friends. Nevertheless, at some point this dislike, this hatred, if it increases in intensity, must pass beyond politics or ethics and into the realm of the psychiatric. I don\\'t for a moment believe that a man who murders people for money is better than a sinister government official. I don\\'t care how suave and cultured the murderer is or whether he knows how to reach the Louvre on the Metro. Whoever is purveying that message needs either medication or meditation.<br /><br />I\\'d like to be able to argue that the production is as thoroughly rotten as its message, but I can\\'t. It\\'s quite well done. (In some ways that\\'s worse, because it makes the film less dismissable.) Even New York City looks photogenic on the screen. And it\\'s been a long time since I\\'ve thought of New York as photogenic. Robert Redford does an admirable job of projecting his character\\'s initial shock and confusion, but then turns into a telecommunicational semi-genius. And, man, he looks just fine! His wardrobe is just right. Even his rimless glasses are becoming. And his peacoat. It\\'s not everyone who can make a navy pea jacket look glamorous. He seems extremely handsome too, the swine. I want to look like that. I want to wear a denim shirt and a tie with such panache. Faye Dunaway is alright in her role but it\\'s not too believable a role. Would anybody eagerly sleep with a guy who has just kidnapped her and is holding her at gunpoint? Even if he did look like Redford? Would anyone be emotionally wounded if, when this ambivalent relationship is about to end, Redford asked her not to tell anybody about what happened? Cliff Robertson is surprisingly good. He does one or two extremely good double-takes. The mailman is superb. The fight between him and Redford in a crowded apartment is exquisitely choreographed and, for once, we really don\\'t know for sure how it will turn out, because Redford (a book reader after all) seems mismatched against the brute cunning of this hired assassin. This is one of John Housemann\\'s final roles. A shame. He\\'s a magnet on screen. And what an end to his life: a friend finds him lost, wandering the streets of New York, in a neighborhood he\\'d been familiar with for most of his life. <br /><br />Yes, the movie is very well executed, but I can\\'t ignore that vicious, paranoid message. I have the same problem with Leni Riefenstahl\\'s \"Triumph of the Will.\" Or her Olympic documentary in which the announcer is watching a foot race in which Jesse Owens is pulling into the lead and says ominously, \"This Negro is dangerous.\"',\n"," \"It is one of the best of Stephen Chow.

I really have no interest in such things, but I went for the fellowship of friends who do have such an interest. Looking over the hundreds of vendor, passing many of them quickly, I spotted someone selling VHS tapes and DVDs. Most of the films he had on DVD were rather recent; the oldest one I noticed was the 1940 Cary Grant-Irene Dunne co-starrer MY FAVORITE WIFE. But the VHS tapes, by their nature, were mostly older films. I couldn\\'t resist buying SOMETHING since they were being sold at 3 tapes for $10.00. What a bargain, as Eddie Murphy used to say. I came across one film that I had heard about for years but had never seen: John Cassavettes\\'s OPENING NIGHT (1977). Well, I certainly wanted that being a fan of Gena Rowlands, and I had heard that this film contained one of her finest performances. He also had FACES (1968). I had seen this about 20 years ago, a time when I probably had not had enough life experience to appreciate it thoroughly. And I wanted to take advantage of the bargain, so I grabbed that one too. My other choice was CLAIRE\\'S KNEE (1970). <br /><br />When I got home, I decided to put aside the work I had planned to do so that I could watch OPENING NIGHT. I was totally enthralled by this film. It focuses on Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), a famous actress of stage and screen, who, during out-of-town previews, is having personal and professional problems coming to terms with both her character and the play\\'s theme of facing aging. After one rehearsal, an avid fan and autograph hound accosts her with cries (and tears) of \"I love you! I love you!\" A few minutes later, this fan is hit by a car and killed. This begins Myrtle\\'s descent into herself where she must face her own fears of aging, the future of her career as a mature actress, and the inadequacies she finds in the play itself (written by a much older female dramatist, played by Joan Blondell). Throughout the film, she sees the dead girl, an obvious symbol of her past; drinks almost constantly; and receives insincere support from her director (Ben Gazzara), the producer (Paul Stewart), her costar (John Cassavettes himself), and the dramatist. Actually, they\\'re more concerned about how her behavior will affect them and their careers: flubbing lines on stage, improvising new lines, generally cracking up on stage, and arriving for the Broadway opening totally drunk. <br /><br />This story functions not only to address the issues of aging but also to promote Cassavettes\\'s displeasure with mainstream movie-making. As I watched the film, I was at times surprised, confused, amused, disparaging, but ultimately involved, entertained, and satisfied. Cassavettes really had a great sense of humor, cared very much that his audience understood what he was implying, and wanted them to be emotionally involved in the story. He makes allusions to ALL ABOUT EVE with the use of the avid theater fan, even dressing the young girl in a slicker and hat similar to the one worn by Anne Baxter at the beginning of that film. This allusion functions most obviously to support his aging theme, the contrast of the older and younger woman. He also obviously uses the contrast as a symbol for Myrtle\\'s confronting her own lost youth. At first, I felt the symbolism was TOO obvious, but then I realized that that was Cassavettes\\'s intention. He doesn\\'t want his audience misunderstanding what he\\'s getting at; if they did, it would interfere with their emotional involvement. This spectre of youth haunts Myrtle, attacks her, and wants to destroy her. Myrtle eventually \"kills\" her, but before she can really come to terms with herself and the play, she must reach bottom (another figurative death?). So Cassavettes has her get so drunk that she can\\'t walk and must crawl to her dressing room the night the play opens on Broadway. She resurrects herself (helping yourself out of such situations is also important to the film\\'s theme) and makes the play a success by giving a great performance and changing the direction of play for the better by improvising so that it contains some ray of hope for the aging character she\\'s playing. These scenes are funny and interesting. Cassavettes and Rowlands actually did the play in front of live audiences, who did and did not know they were going to be part of a movie. The play they\\'re doing also acts as contrast: it\\'s mainstream and self-serious about the issues it addresses, that is, until Myrtle changes its denouement. In doing so, she also improves the work of her co-stars. The natural evolution of interaction (achieved through improvisation)between and among human beings, subjective realism, and universal truth - these were Cassavettes\\'s concerns in making films. <br /><br />Gena Rowlands is amazing throughout. Of course, she has that great face, and Cassavettes (notoriously in love with her throughout their marriage) treats us to numerous closeups of it so that we too can feel her emotions and that we know what\\'s going on inside of her. She makes you care so much about this character that you want to see her work her way out of this crisis of the soul. And this is what holds your attention for the 2 hours and 30 minutes running time. The film is deliberately paced at times and requires constant attention, but anyone with interest in good film-making and great acting will be rewarded. Someone else said that this is a movie for people who love movies. All others be forewarned. <br /><br />Seek out OPENING NIGHT if you\\'ve never seen it. Everyone in it is excellent, and it\\'s one of Cassavettes\\'s best films.',\n"," \"As a fan of C.J.'s earlier movie, Latter Days, I really wanted to like this film.<br /><br />The nicest thing I can say, however, is that it's NOT an awful film. There are some good performances, and a few funny scenes. In particular, Tori Spelling has a couple of great scenes where she's talking to her fiancé's ex-boyfriend.<br /><br />Overall, though, it's pretty week. The script falls back on weird coincidences and clichéd movie moments way too often. (The main character went to Stanford on a golf scholarship, and his high school buddy doesn't even know that he plays the game?) <br /><br />Most of the time, this movie had no idea where it was going or what it was trying to say. There are a lot of scenes that are mildly cute, but ultimately turn out to be a waste of time. And you could easily cut half the characters from the film without losing anything.<br /><br />Still, for all it's faults, I would have to say that this is one of the better gay films of recent years. Which says a lot about how bad most gay films are.<br /><br />I'm hoping C.J.'s next film will be better.\",\n"," \"This film is a cash in.

Hey, he could have at least shaved off his hair and lost the moustache, just for the sake of continuity. Some correctional centres show this movie in order to punish offenders.

If you enjoyed the teen comedies of the 80s like Weird Science, Screwballs, HOTS, and Loose Screws, this is a movie for you. It's a bit short; they could have added some more scenes away from the primary two locations and spent more time at the webcast house. I would recommend it for a weekend rental.

Melodramatic in story and acting, today it seems ludicrous, particularly the casting of Myrna Loy as Nubi, a seductive gypsy. Imagine Nora Charles breaking up a young couple and driving a young man to steal. Outrageous! However, as many people know, when Loy first came to Hollywood, she did quite a few of these exotic seductress roles.<br /><br />Based on a play, \"The Squall\" concerns the aforementioned Gypsy who in the film is now in Hungary (Spain in the play) running away from her cruel master and inviting herself into the home of the Lajos family (Richard Tucker and Alice Joyce), basically by appearing at the door. One by one, Nubi seduces the men of the family and the farm talking her pidgin English (\"Nubi not bad! Nubi do nothing wrong!\") and dropping hints about nice presents. The son in the family, Paul (Carroll Nye) is engaged to the beautiful Irma (Loretta Young) and can\\'t wait to marry her. He loses interest when he meets Nubi.<br /><br />With the exception of the lovely Alice Joyce, Zasu Pitts as a woman who lives in the household and the stunningly beautiful Loretta Young, the acting is uniformly awful.

But alas, this is not the case with Michael Winterbottom's fascinating Wonderland. Here Winterbottom has gone back to the roots of the Ken Loach, Mike Leigh genre of kitchen-sink drama, crossing it with the narrative feel of Robert Altman, and the free-from style of Lars von Trier, creating in the process a new and deeply affecting tale of three south London sister over the course of one weekend (three days). The great thing about this is, briefly, for the course of the film anyway, British cinema has it's own identity. The BIG brit films of the last few years have all been tired American knock-offs, from Guy Ritchie's pathetic lock-stock and Snatch, to the empty romanticised views depicted in films like Four Wedding and Notting Hill. Wonderland gives an authentic view of London, without the glamour but with much more pathos, and fully developed characters. <br /><br />The ensemble cast of rising character actors are perfectly put together, they may not be familiar to some audiences even in the UK, but the work of the three female leads, McKee, Parker and Henderson are given fine support from the men, Ian Hart, John Simm and David Fahm. The cinema-verite style gives the film a strong realism, making some the more depressing scenes almost un-watchable, but Winterbottom and writer Laurence Coriat should be commended for trying something different within the confines of the ever-predictable British Film Industry (\\x99). It sadness me that this film is so underrated, whilst average films like Billy Elliot gather a barrage of Oscar and Bafta nominations, I don't remember Wonderland getting a mention. This is by far the best British film I've seen in a long time, not a perfect film by any means, one flaw would be that some of the characters are pushed to the background, never getting a chance to fully shine, but a film this good is a rare thing.

You just stop caring about them after 10 minutes. 4/10 (and thats being generous).\",\n"," \"I just finished watching this film and it brought back to me memories of my life in Albania. the film is very precise in it's description of life in our poor land after the riots and the exoduses that occurred in the early '90s. I was lucky myself not to have gone through what most people go through during this film but I can identify with some of it. even though the film focuses more on the italian businessman, the struggle for survival that most Albanians had to go and still have to is quite clear. this film should be watched by all interested in understanding why people have to abandon their homelands. this is a perfect example and should open eyes to many.\",\n"," \"Being categorized as science fiction is stretching the theme somewhat as time travel, the technology and theory played little part of the movie. Archaeologists have usually been portrayed as peaceful, enthusiastic scientists. I expected them to be overjoyed with the prospect of visiting an historical period for which they have an interest. However, even before they arrive in the midst of a medieval war they have all had several turns at arguing with each other. Even the scientists who developed the technology cannot agree amongst themselves. I did not seem to miss anything during a coffee break during which I did not pause the movie nor did anything important occur when I fast forwarded for a few minutes. Timeline is a fast paced action movie with a science fiction foundation and seemingly authentic medieval conflict. I would recommend this movie for a rainy day or late night insomnia. Although happy to have watched it, I'll never watch it again primarily due to the unnecessary and continual arguments and, secondly, because I could not understand why the 'bad guys' behaved as they did.\",\n"," 'Duvall is, without doubt, one of the finest actors on the C20th screen. Unlike so many superstars (Nicholson, Pacino, Hoffman), you forget he\\'s Duvall within the first couple of minutes of his performance. \"The Apostle\" is no exception.<br /><br />Here we have a completely three-dimensional view of a man carrying personal demons and plenty of psychological baggage. Duvall certainly deserved his Academy Award nomination.<br /><br />The central idea of the movie is also very strong: preacher seeks redemption from past deeds by once more bringing the power of the Word to a small community.<br /><br />But Duvall the actor, executive producer and director is not equalled by Duvall the writer. I sat watching with the constant niggle that something was missing. And as the final credits scrolled, and reminded me that Farrah Fawcett, Billy Bob Thornton, Miranda Richardson and a handful of others had been on screen, I got the sudden revelation that none had had a part anywhere near as round as Duvall\\'s.<br /><br />This truly is a one-man movie. Even though the director is on screen for virtually every shot, it\\'s not an egotistical piece. But it\\'s not a deep as it could have been. Which is a great shame. Because with an antagonist of some kind, this would have risen from good film to masterpiece.<br /><br />Watch it, but only for the central performance.

The movie starts out with a man teaching his class and telling the audience some background information. The whole aspect behind the movie is the event that a teacher has a school boy crush on one of his students,then she gets kidnapped, and he is the one that actually tries to find who the kidnapper is and where Ally is. During this investigation, he finds out some disturbing information about his perverted co-worker, and some other students. He also finds that the father of Ally is more concerned about his business and sex life then he is about his daughter. The students and faculty are all convinced that he has something to do with the kidnapping, and he is questioned and interrogated many times. With some interesting plot twists and and fair storyline, I enjoyed this movie. But, from the title, I would like to say that there was no reason what so ever to have the scene of nudity in it that it did, it was purely disgusting. With that being said, I give this movie a 7/10.',\n"," '\"The Secret of Roan Inish\" is a film for those who want a taste of the Irish myth. It is wonderfully filmed and heartwarming in its characterization. The whole world revealed by director Sayles is enticing and intriguing magic.

That\\'s why this film stands out and apart from equally sweet tales like \"Into the West\".<br /><br />I warn you that it\\'s old-fashioned storytelling. Its pace is slower than what most are accustomed to these days, but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s boring. If you must have fantastic elements and don\\'t like subtlety and family focus, this film isn\\'t for you. But if you like rich and original old-style tales that make you feel good and happy to have heard them, see \"The Secret of Roan Inish\" and relish its perfection.',\n"," 'The two things that are most striking about this film are its unqualified realism and the beauty of its wilderness photography.<br /><br />The story takes place in the 17th century in what was to be Canada; it concerns a Jesuit priest (Father Laforgue) from an upper class family in France who comes to Quebec City and is tasked with traveling through the wilderness some 1,500 miles west to work at the Huron Mission there. Laforgue is accompanied on his journey by a party of Algonquin Indians as well as by Daniel, a young French interpreter who is primarily just up for the adventure.<br /><br />As the journey proceeds and the seasons move from fall into a harsh winter the mood of the film becomes ever more bleak. The continuing culture clashes between the Algonqins and Laforgue are sometimes humorous but are ultimately sad in their revealing insights into how difficult it is for one culture to understand another. One scene has Laforgue transcribing a brief story told by the Algonquin chief and then having Daniel take the transcription some distance and read it back to another tribesman. Laforgue is trying to show the Indians that he has much to teach them, but their interpretation of the incident is that he must be some sort of demon. When the party meets up with some members of another tribe and they see Laforgue dressed in his black robe and ask if he is intelligent, the Algonquin chief quickly answers, \"No.\" On the other hand Laforgue views the Indians in their current unenlightened state as savages.<br /><br />Not all is love and harmony between the various Indian tribes. When the Lafourgue party encounters a band of Iroquois there are some scenes of violence and torture where the squeamish may want to avert their eyes.<br /><br />Daniel, speaking the Algonquin language and having taken up with the chief\\'s daughter, begins to have some understanding of the Indians and their ways. One interesting exchange between Daniel and Lagorgue is:<br /><br />Daniel: They believe that in the forest at night the dead can see.<br /><br />Laforgue: It\\'s childish Daniel.<br /><br />Daniel: Is it harder to believe than in men of paradise where we all sit on clouds and look at God?<br /><br />Laforgue\\'s most singular personal characteristic is his unwavering faith. His reaction to sexual temptation is confession of sin and self flogging. He sincerely believes that Christianity can bring salvation to the Indians, but the Indians have their own gods and view Laforgue with incomprehension. The film\\'s success in making us understand both of these positions gives the ultimate conclusion a dimension of tragedy.',\n"," \"From opening to closing Midnight Run is the definative road movie, and is an absolute must view.

Actually, none of the characters in the film give a hoot about the dead man but are only seeking to protect themselves from scandal.<br /><br />The film, however, is a delightful entertainment, beautifully photographed amidst the Vermont fall foliage, and filled with indelible performances by Shirley MacLaine in her first screen role and veterans Mildred Natwick, Edmund Gwenn, Mildred Dunnock, and John Forsyth. Even though Hitch portrays people at their most loathsome, there is still something so charming about them that you can't help but smile and forgive their all too human foibles.\",\n"," 'No ,I\\'m not kidding. If they ever propose a movie idea, they should be kicked out of the studio. I\\'m serious.

As directed by \"The Usual Suspects\" helmer Bryan Singer, this top-drawer cinematic adaptation of the popular Marvel Comic series sets a whole new standard for filming superhero sagas. Unlike the gratuitously overblown, happily-ever-after, D.C. Comics inspired \"Superman\" and \"Batman\" franchises, \"X-Men\" differs because Marvel Comics forged superheroes with tragic flaws. Not only does Singer orchestrate an entertaining but intelligent yarn around titans of Good and Evil battling for supremacy with the fate of mankind at stake, but he also tackles important cultural issues integral to the plot that enhance its subtext about intolerance. Ultimately, \"X-Men\" qualifies as the best superhero comic book movie ever produced, thanks to a stellar cast led by Shakespearean heavyweights Patrick \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" Stewart and Sir Ian \"Richard III\" McKellen, \"Matrix\" style special effects which compliment rather than eclipse the plot, and a literate script that parries childish pratfalls. Obviously, hardcore aficionados of either the animated TV series (1992-98) or the comic book itself may complain about the various liberties that Singer and scenarist David Hayter take with the subject matter.<br /><br />Over the opening credits, Patrick Stewart narrates that \"in the not too distant future\" genetic mutations will trigger the \"next stage of evolution.\" As the next evolutionary stage of life, mutants\\x97a.k.a. Homo superior\\x97will suffer persecution because they are not only different but also potentially dangerous. The prejudice that mankind manifests toward these mutants serves as an allegory for our current climate of political, racial, and sexual bigotry as well as the uncertainty that older teenagers and younger twentysomethings encounter as they search for their niche in society. Some critics have compared the showdown between Professor X (Stewart) and Magneto (McKellen) with the rivalry between Martin Luther King and Malcolm X during the turbulent 1960s, while others have recognized mutants as symbols of any oppressed group forced to identify themselves, whether they be classified as homosexuals, communists, Jewish, or firearms owners. Like the famous \"Star Wars\" prologue, Stewart\\'s voice-over neatly encapsulates the origins of the \"X-Men\" and the inherent conflicts confronting them.<br /><br />While \"Superman\" and \"Batman\" unfolded in linear fashion, starting from the beginning, Singer picks up \"X-Men\" somewhere in the middle. The setting is Poland in 1944, and the Nazis are parading helpless Jews into the gas chambers for extermination. When young Erik Lensherr (Brett Morris, bearing an uncanny resemblance to the older Ian McKellen) finds himself separated from his parents as the Nazis are about to gas them, he experiences such heretofore unknown terror that he emanates an invisible force field with his fingertips. He destroys the high, iron, barb-wired gates while several soldiers struggle to restrain him. Finally, smashing Lensherr in the face with his rifle butt, one Nazi sentry knocks him unconscious. Nevertheless, his supernatural powers stun the guards. This grim scene in Auschwitz hearkens back to \"Schindler\\'s List (1193), while the show of paranormal power recalls Brian De Palma\\'s \"Carrie.\" As introductions go, the concentration camp scene grips with its poignancy. Clearly, this horrific, downbeat scene is not the usual way to kick off a superficial movie about a comic book franchise.<br /><br />Flash-forwarding through time, Singer brings us to contemporary Washington, D.C. Dr. Jean Gray (\"GoldenEye\\'s statuesque Famke Janssen), a telepathic mutant with telekinetic powers, address Congress on the controversial subject of mutant registration. Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davidson of \"Willard\") believes mutants with their extraordinary physical and mental prowess endanger humanity. The fanatical Kelly demands all mutants be required to identify themselves. Moreover, he campaigns for registering them since they cannot be trusted to supervise their powers responsibly. Some mutants, he argues, can eavesdrop on your mind and read your thoughts. While Kelly drums up support for his proposed legislation, Dr. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) watches quietly from the balcony. Although confined to a wheelchair, Xavier is a super-telepath that can do what Kelly fears the most. Not only can Xavier read your innermost thoughts, but he also can exert control of another person\\'s body and speak through them with the ease of a ventriloquist.<br /><br />Unlike the cynical Erik Lensherr, a.k.a. Magneto, who insists war between humans and mutants is inevitable, Xavier contends that mutants and humans can co-exist in harmony. As far as Xavier is concerned, people like Kelly are well-meaning but misinformed. Xavier has established a School for Gifted Youth in Westchester, New York, where he teaches young mutants to curb their potentially destructive urges. Some of his long-time students, Cyclops (James Marsden of \"27 Dresses\") who sports special sunglasses to shield his lethal laser beam eyes; Storm (Halle Berry of \"Die Another Day\") who controls weather and deploys lightning bots; and Dr. Jean Grey serve as instructors when they aren\\'t running errands for Xavier. Concisely, in a model of economy, Singer establishes the characters and creates the overall conflict between them while broaching questions about the enormity of segregation! Moreover, he inserts several amusing tidbits of humor that flesh out the characters without detracting from the storyline.<br /><br />The conflict in David Hayter\\'s screenplay that prompts Magneto and Xavier to clash again concerns tow mutants thrown together by fate. A teenage girl in Meridian, Mississippi, Marie (Anna Paquin of \"The Piano\") discovers her touch can kill. Also known as \\'Rogue,\\' she can drain the life out of people. Horrified by her inexplicable power, she hits the road and eventually meets Logan (Hugh Jackman), a rough-hewn cage fighter nicknamed \\'Wolverine,\\' an anti-social amnesia-stricken loner searching for his past.<br /><br />Director Bryan Singer toils throughout \"X-Men\" to dispel any notions that it is just another disposable comic book epic. He triumphs in every department from superb casting to thoughtful plotting. Stewart and McKellen embellish \"X-Men\" and provide it with the kind of dignity that Alec Guinness brought to \"Star Wars.\" When Magneto and Xavier speak, their conversations sound like the oral equivalent of a chess match. \"X-Men\" hits the mark because Singer and Hayter fuse superior dramatic elements in the best Aristotelian fashion; its heroes experience a tough time winning.',\n"," 'If you like edge of your seat action and non stop fright, then you have to see the 1990 remake of \"Night of The Living Dead\" a horror fan\\'s dream come true.<br /><br />This movie was just indescribable! I have never seen such a nerve wracking movie! I was on the edge of my seat from the beginning to the end!<br /><br />The cast was one of the best ever assembled and the talent in this movie was as evident as champagne at an aristocratic event.<br /><br />What can you say about Patricia Tallman except that she is dynamite incarnate! She plays Barbara, a shy, timid and somewhat neurotic woman who was obviously under the thumb of her recently deceased mother. But she soon does a lot of growing up and has a wit for survival that could rival any Navy SEAL or Army Recon and an aim to match!<br /><br />Throw in her brother Johnny, played as only it could have been by the awesome Bill Mosley and you have the makings of a night to remember.<br /><br />When one thinks of cool, bad as they come and a force to be reckoned with, you can\\'t help but think of Tony Todd who stars as Ben in one of the best roles in his life. When Ben speaks, he commands your attention and you find yourself hanging on every word, hoping that he is the savior they all need.<br /><br />The chemistry between Ben and Barbara on the screen in magnetic and makes for as believable a movie scenario as I have ever seen. You can\\'t help but hope that Ben and Barbara make it out alive so they can start a life together they are *that* good as a team. As two people who, through no fault of their own, are thrown into a nightmare situation where certain death is like a shadow hanging over them, they act more like leaders than victims of their horrible reality.<br /><br />A great supporting cast includes Tom Towles as Harry Cooper whom you pray that if the zombies get anyone, it will be him. I have never in my life seen someone so convincing as Tom was in this movie. When he finally gets his in the end, I stood up and cheered!<br /><br />Mckee Anderson is just as convincing as the mealy mouthed but tired of her husband\\'s crap, Helen Cooper.<br /><br />Notable performances were also put in by William Butler and Katie Finneran as Tom and Judy Rose, two sweethearts who as naive as they are, have smarts of their own to help them survive.<br /><br />The zombies were believable, the makeup was incredible and the scenery was top notch. From cemetery to farmhouse better scenery couldn\\'t have been found.<br /><br />I could have lived with a different ending but realize it was necessary to make the movie as powerful and poignant, yes poignant as it was.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie as one of the greatest horror films in history and would suggest you watch it with ALL the lights on!!<br /><br />',\n"," 'totally predictable plot (although the final few frames were nicely done), unbelievably banal dialog capped by McDormand\\'s soliloquy to her son -- how such a great actress agreed to deliver such tripe is beyond me -- this movie just fails. I can\\'t understand the favorable reviews.<br /><br />Opera fans will understand if I say that the plot is less creative, more believable, and more boring than \"Cosi Fan Tutte,\" and without the Mozart music there is really no reason at all to sit through this flic.<br /><br />And what\\'s with the supposed-to-be-sexy shots of the Alex character who makes love and goes skinny-dipping without removing her top? What great auteur figured that one out? Supposed to show the prudishness of the character who tells her lover \"f*** me!\"?

He plays his role like number two in Austin Powers.Easily the worst of the Airport movies.1 out of 10',\n"," \"I thought this was a very daring representation of the old hokey 'Tarzan' concept made so popular by Hollywood, Weismuller, et al.<br /><br />Yes; there is a lot of silly stuff. But then, the idea is silly. It is almost unbelievable that a human baby could be sired to adulthood by chimpanzees. I am tempted to say completely unbelievable, but that the concept has never been tried. And there is certainly a bit too much anthropomorphism for comfort. Though under the circumstances I can see how that would be very difficult to avoid. We also now have a much greater insight into the issues of acculturation, and know that a human raised from infancy without human behavioural prompts would ultimately never learn them in adulthood.<br /><br />Still, if you can get your head around that lot, there's a great deal to admire that is both imaginative and daring. Lambert does the beast thing with tremendous aplomb. I am tempted to say that it is the most convincing and sympathetic role I have seen him play. There are plenty of other excellent performances too. Not least of which are Sir Ralph Richardson and Ian Holm.<br /><br />What is particularly disturbing - and rightly so - is the simian perception of humans. We get to see ourselves almost from the point of view of the poor, dumb, helpless brutes over whom we so routinely lord it. And it demonstrates well how the phony 'civilisation' and 'morality' with which we cloak and justify our conduct, is no more than an expression of own selfishness and arrogance. It may seem a little overstated at times, especially in the hideous museum dissection rooms, but what we see isn't just a truth about the Victorians; its a truth about the way we are today. It's one that needs to be stated, and cannot be stated often enough. Holm's character's obsession with the 'ray-zor' as a symptom of civilisation - as if to possess facial hair were a primitive condition to be scorned - is an excellent case in point. Primitive bearded readers take note.<br /><br />The story is depressing. Ultimately it's a tragedy. Because even though he returns to the jungle and the freedom from moral tyranny that is truly human 'civilisation'; we know he's doomed. Before the third millennium is 50 years old, wild simians will be hunted into extinction as bush meat, and their environment developed for agriculture and mineral exploitation to gratify insatiable human excess.<br /><br />In the end, it's a tale about ourselves. The path to extinction that other simians tread, must eventually be followed by humans.<br /><br />Highly recommended for its ethical take, despite the hokey moments.\",\n"," 'I vividly remember the first time I watched this movie. The lead up to the finding of the old films was without any obvious clues, so it wasn\\'t \\'til the Richard Pearse footage that we became seriously suspicious. My husband is a forensic photographer so the digital imaging to get the date off the newspaper was a dead giveaway to us. The eleventy seven dozen eggs was another big pointer. From then on we treated the whole thing as a lark and just revelled in the imagination that is Peter Jackson\\'s trade mark. <br /><br />We were of course, greatly impressed with the enormity of the project and could only surmise that the actors in the \"Salome\" movie were also conned into thinking they were filming a real movie and didn\\'t know the truth until the \\'doco\\' came out. Either that or Peter Jackson has a loyal entourage that kept a secret which could never have survived in any Hollywood arena. <br /><br />I look forward to even more of Peters work.....',\n"," \"I knew little of the film before seeing it and I was blown away by the premise and production quality. At first i had trouble discerning whether it was based on a true story or not, but i found as the film progressed that this became less and less relevant to my viewing experience. I was utterly enthralled in the first half of the film, the revelation that there might be something supernatural at play was realised beautifully, with some truly terrifying moments. This ghostly suggestion never overpowers the film; the story retains its dominant themes of grief and the process of grieving. The mise-en-scene was delightful, it was highly stylized and had real dreamy take on the horror conventions. For example the shots of the 'haunted' house might have been melodramatic and cliché, however this recurring image was often offset with the wheeling stars overhead, creating an ethereal quality that set it apart. I'd recommend this film to fans of psychological horror, its spooky, moody and satisfying with some great twists!<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT! The twists in the second half of the film, though motivated and logical, were too redolent of Twin Peaks for me, so much that it detracted from my experience of Lake Mungo. Not only is the dead girl Alice PALMER (Laura Palmer being the deceased subject of Twin Peaks) but she was a young woman with a double life which was only revealed after her death. She is quoted as being a girl who 'kept it secret that she had secrets', secrets which involved a lurid affair, visions of death, and the seedy underbelly of a quiet rural town. The clues are pieced together from new footage of the girl which keeps surfacing, the deceased girl even buried evidence that is later unearthed. For all those who have seen David Lynch's fantastic series, all this will seem too familiar to ignore. The documentary style does give this similar story a new edge, as it lacks the indulgent melodrama of Twin Peaks. Also the supernatural element sets it apart,and the revelation at the end is something really original. END SPOILER<br /><br />I would have liked the nature of the element of 'video' more explored, what it means to be filmed, what kind of reality video can offer, can we trust video, can we trust our own eyes? These are notions which I think are suggested by the ironic documentary style of a fiction film but this is never really focused on. This is what was lacking for me, especially considering my qualms mentioned in the spoiler.

Joan Crawford looked good, but what was up with the sweat stains? And the singing? The movie is for the very bored only....definitely not a classic. It seemed like they were filming in sequence and run out of budget or were just sick of making the movie by the end of it.\",\n"," 'What a strangely wonderful, if sometimes slight and bulky, big-budget fantasy this is. Takashi Miike had already proved, by the time he got to The Great Yokhai War, that he could dip into other films aside from his supposed niche of the crime/yakuza genre (Visitor Q and Andromedia showed this, the former great the latter lesser). But here Miike, in his first and only co-screen writing credit no less, proves that he can deliver the goods on a post-modern soup of mythical fantasy conventions, and with it boatload of CGI, creature-effects and make-up, and an epic battle that is more like a \"festival\" than something out of Lord of the Rings. The comparisons can be made far and wide, to be sure, and the most obvious to jump on would be Miyazaki, for the seemingly unique mixture of kids-as-big-heroes, power-hungry sorcerers looking for the energy of the earth as the main source, machinery as the greatest evil, and many bizarrely defined, flamboyantly designed creatures (or Yokai of the title). But there can also be comparisons made to Star Wars, especially to the Gungan battle in TPM, and to the whole power-play between good and evil with similar forces. Or to anime like Samurai 7. Or, of course, to Henson\\'s films. And through all of these comparisons, and even through the flaws or over-reaching moments, it\\'s Miike all the way with the sensibilities of effects and characters. <br /><br />Here, Ryunosuke Kamiki plays Tadashi, the prototypical kid who starts out sort of gullible and sensitive to things in the world, but will become the hero in a world going into darkness. The darkness is from an evil sorcerer, who gets his energy from all of the rage and wretched vibes in the human world, and who is also starting to put to death the spirits and other creatures, the Yokhai, into a fire that sends them into gigantic robots that have only one mission- to destroy and kill anything in their paths. Tadashi gets as pumped up to fight Sato the sorcerer as the Yokai once Sato\\'s main minion and cohort, Agi (Kill Bill\\'s Chiaki Kuriyama, another great villainies) steals Tadashi\\'s little furry companion, a Sunekosuri. Soon, things come to a head, in a climax that brings to mind many other fantasy films and stories, but can only be contained, up to a point, by Miike and his crew. I would probably recommend The Great Yokai War for kids, but in the forward note that it\\'s not some watered down fantasy in American circles. This has creatures galore, including a one-eyed umbrella stand, and a walking, talking wall, not to mention a turtle, a fire serpent, and a woman who became cursed by Sato. So the variety is on high on that end, and one might almost feel like the creatures and effects- which grows to unfathomable heights when the \"festival\" hits with the Yokai reaching hundreds of miles in scope. But there\\'s also a sense of fantasy being strong in both the light and the dark, and Sunekosuri becomes perhaps the greatest emotional tool at Miike\\'s disposal (and not just because it\\'s cuteness squared); where else to get an audience riled up than over a little furry ball of fury, who ends up in a tragic battle with Tadashi in robot form? <br /><br />Yet through all of this, the sense of anarchy that can be found in the brightest spots of Miike\\'s career is here as well, which distinguishes it from its animated, Muppet and sci-fi counterparts. There\\'s the bizarre humor as usual, including a song dedicated to Akuzi beans at a crucial moment in the climax, and more than a few flights of fancy with the creatures and fight scenes (I loved, for example, the guy with the big blue head who has to make it smaller, or the anxious turtle-Yokai). The biggest danger with Miike\\'s access to bigger special effects and computer wizardry, which he flirts with, is overkill on this end. He\\'s got everything down, I\\'m sure, with storyboards, and he creates some memorable impressions with some compositions (one of them is when all is said and done, and Tadashi and the \\'other\\' human character are in the middle of the Tokyo rubble in an overhead shot), but the CGI is sometimes a little unconvincing with the robots, and the interplay skirts on being TOO flamboyant, and some visuals, like the overlay of the Yokai spreading the word about the big festival on the map, just seem weak and pat. I almost wondered if Miike might dip into (bad) Spy Kids territory, quite frankly.<br /><br />But this liability aside, The Great Yokai War provides more than a share of excitement, goofy thrills, and innocent melodrama that came with many of the best childhood fantasies. It owes a lot to cinema, as well as traditional Japanese folklore, but the screws are always turning even in its most ludicrous and veeringly confusing beats. It\\'s not the filmmaker at his very best, but working in experimentation in a commercial medium ends up working to his advantage. It\\'s got a neat little message, and lots of cool adventure. 7.5/10',\n"," 'For the life of me, I still can\\'t figure out why Traitor is getting such poor promotion, but if I were the studio I\\'d be trying my damnedest to get people into the theatre to this.

Don\\'t be fooled by the commercials that say that \"Traitor is this year\\'s Bourne Ultimatem\", because this is clearly not true. While there is plenty of mystery and conspiracy to go around, this is a completely different situation that really makes the viewer think at the end of the movie. The great thing about Traitor is the fact that politics aren\\'t heavy-handed or one-sided a la Syriana or any of the other cookie cutter political thrillers out there. The film really allows the viewer to draw their one conclusions based their own individual moral compass. I would say that anyone who is NOT looking for just another Michael Bay-esquire popcorn flick should totally love Traitor.<br /><br />-J.',\n"," \"I saw an advanced screening of this movie and it definitely isn't as good as the first one with The Rock (Dwayne Johnson). The first one was a really good movie. Johnny Knoxville made the movie funny and the villain was very cool and a good actor. Not to mention The Rock, just about anything he's in is a good movie. I didn't think the sequel was going to be good but I figured it would at least be a little interesting because it's the sequel to an awesome movie. But I was disappointed. It's very boring, hardly any action, the acting definitely isn't the best, and it's really country. It's just like a long episode of Chuck Norris except, I've seen episodes of Chuck Norris that are more interesting than this movie. I wouldn't pay more than five dollars for this movie. maybe ten but i would recommend renting it before you buy it. I watched this movie out of curiosity, because i liked the first one. If you liked the first one too, then you'll be disappointed with this one and it has nothing to do with the first one so I wouldn't buy this movie if I were you unless you find it on the clearance or sales rack.\",\n"," '\"Sukiyaki Western Django\" is pretty much what you would expect from a Western by Takashi Miike...it\\'s violent, it\\'s funny, and it\\'s just plain weird at times.<br /><br />It looks kind of like the old west, except the buildings are distinctly Japanese. It feels kind of like the old west, except some characters are in cowboy garb while others are in what appears to be feudal Japanese American Indian gang war duds. And the dialog? \"Don\\'t you know your Shakespeare?\" There are two feuding families, the White & the Red, and caught in between is our hero, whoever he is, and an old woman, her daughter, and a little boy. The daughter, having married outside of her clan, and the boy, of mixed background. The story itself is a bit hard to follow, but the action makes up for it.<br /><br />There\\'s a lot of gun play, a lot of crossbow play, and a lot of fancy shooting from both weapons, along with things like hitting one\\'s target through a hole just blown in one victim. And grandma, well, she\\'s apparently a highly trained martial arts & gunslinger kind of gal, and she learned from the best, Ringo (Quentin Tarrentino) who also taught her how to make sukiyaki that wasn\\'t so sweet.<br /><br />If you\\'ve seen all the old Spaghetti Westerns, this is a new twist on them that\\'s well worth seeing. There\\'s an astounding amount of wild and weird action, and there\\'s also some ridiculous comedic bits, like a bunch of men using the sheriff of the town as a shield, and looking exactly like a conga line.<br /><br />Great action, interesting humor, and a decidedly different take on the western theme. Plus, the Japanese have a sense of poetry too, and there\\'s even a bit of room in here for that, before the action kicks in again. If you like Miike & you like westerns that are QUITE a bit out of the ordinary, check this out. 8 out of 10.',\n"," 'This is a film that makes you say 2 things... 1) I can do much better than this( acting,writing and directing) 2) this is so bad I must leave a review and warn others...<br /><br />Looks as if it was shot with my flip video.

In the meantime it had gained in notoriety because Pauline Kael's THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK had suggested that the Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Welles screenplay for KANE was based on Sturgis' screenplay here. As is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb web site, Kael overstated her case.<br /><br />There are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of Charles Foster Kane: the newsreel (representing Ralston - the Henry Luce clone), Thatcher's memoirs, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane, and Raymond the butler. Each has his or her different slant on Kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. And of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of Kane's story. This method also leads to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident.<br /><br />This is not the situation in THE POWER AND THE GLORY. Yes, like KANE it is about a legendary business leader - here it is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. But there are only two narrators - they are Garner's right hand man Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of Kane in Garner. Henry, when he narrates, is talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in Henry.<br /><br />Typical example: Although he worked his way up, Tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later years. Unions are troublemakers, and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. Henry describes Tom's confrontation with the Union in a major walk-out, and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life. But Henry's wife reminds him how Tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the Union's headquarters - killing many people). So we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black.<br /><br />I'm not really knocking THE POWER AND THE GLORY for not duplicating KANE's success (few films do - including all of Orson Welles' other films), but I am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one's interest to the end. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally, the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home.<br /><br />When they marry, Tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. But in America great business success comes at a cost. Tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire (he expands it and improves it constantly). But it takes him away from home too much, and he loses touch with Sally. And he also notices Eve (Helen Vinson), the younger woman who becomes his mistress. When Sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her.<br /><br />Similarly Tom too gets a full shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of Henry). Eve marries Tom, and presents him with a son - but it turns out to be Eve's son by Tom's son Tom Jr. (Philip Trent). The discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes Tom to shoot himself.<br /><br />The film is not a total success - the action jumps at times unconvincingly. Yet it does make the business seem real (note the scene when Tom tells his Board of Directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line, and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). Sturgis came from a wealthy background, so he could bring in this type of detail. So on the whole it is a first rate film. No CITIZEN KANE perhaps, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in Depression America.\",\n"," 'Unlike other early adult movies such as DEEP THROAT and BEHIND THE GREEN DOOR, this fine combination of explicit sex and shoot \\'em up thrills gets little respect even from genre fans. This is largely due to the brutal nature of the film\\'s numerous rape sequences, commendably NOT of the \\'they may protest at first\\' variety. The story\\'s well detailed in the other comment you\\'ll find here, so I won\\'t go into that. <br /><br />Most of the performers here made very few films (save for Levi Richards who made tons) and even beautiful blonde Barbara Bourbon, who turns in some effective acting as well as the proud, resilient farmer\\'s wife fighting to protect her daughters from \\'a fate worse than death\\', only made a handful of X-rated appearances, most memorably of course in Radley Metzger\\'s timeless PRIVATE AFTERNOONS OF PAMELA MANN. Director \"David Fleetwood\" is actually sixties schlock producer Joe Robertson (THE CRAWLING HAND, THE SLIME PEOPLE, THE AGENT FOR H.A.R.M.), so the flick\\'s inconspicuous professionalism in just about every aspect of production as well as narrative drive should come as no surprise. He went on to carve a niche for himself as \\'female\\' (for the face value crowd) porn director \"Adele Robbins\" with movies like SWEET ALICE and INNOCENT SEDUCTION. <br /><br />You may think that this early rape \\'n\\' revenge movie stands diametrically opposed to his later couples friendly numbers. Anyone taking the effort to sit down and watch the film in its entirety will come to realize however that the female characters (Bourbon\\'s in particular) are well drawn, not whining victims at all, perfectly capable of righting the wrongs inflicted upon them. So give this classic its due and allow it to take its rightful place in the pantheon alongside its more renowned genre brethren.',\n"," 'Please, If you\\'re thinking about renting this movie, don\\'t. If you\\'re thinking of watching a couple of downloaded clips, don\\'t.

The witty one liners were something you\\'d expect from a room of highly paid anti-social 7 year olds that eat paint-chips for breakfast.<br /><br />The problem with this movie, is that it tries to be a movie like \"Evil Dead 2\"(do not under any circumstances associate these 2 movies) in that it\\'s so bad it\\'s funny. But it also tries to be funny at the same time, and fails so overwhelmingly to do so, that your sense of humor is left too crippled to do anything but set off your gag reflex in an attmept to save itself.<br /><br />I could go on for much much more, detailing just how awful it really was, but I think it would strip me of my will to live just to continue to think about it.

You could see the love and trust between the two as they danced. It brought tears to my eyes. The final dance between the three main characters just had me spellbound and had my mouth just gaping throughout the scene. I never realized the hard work that dancers go through and they deserve credit for sticking with such a difficult occupation and the training they go through. For anyone that loves music and dancing this would be an excellent movie to see. I always knew that Patrick Swayze could dance but,this was so revealing as to how well he does,even after all the injuries that he has been through.

In actuality, most of the exterior shots were filmed in Marblehead Massachusett on Marblehead Neck near several rocky seaside geographic areas including the Churn and Castle Rock. My initial interest in the film was because of two factors: 1) the Marblehead film location in my hometown and, 2) the fact that my grandmother Lizzette M. Woodfin was hired as a stand-in for Mary Pickford during filming of several scenes including the \"cliff scene\". Both women were small (5\\') in stature and both my father and grandmother related the fact that she was a stand-in with her back to the camera for the cliff scene as part of the Chiefton filming set. I just wanted to relate this story for future film historians and buffs. The film itself (my DVD copy is somewhat poor) is very well done with lots of action and expressive acting including several scenes where Miss Pickford portrays a strong woman characterization. I enjoyed it and would love to get a better copy of it although I am unsure whether one exists as I have seen in various movie sites that remaining copies are dark because of deterioration. A very nice film of the silent genre with lots of action!',\n"," 'When this movie first came out, the reviews were generally favorable but the subject matter was utterly depressing. What could be sadder than the appalling mistreatment of Afghan women at the hands of the Taliban? I skipped the movie when it ran at the theaters.<br /><br />I recently viewed the movie and my earlier impressions were correct. It is very depressing. However, I would recommend it simply because it is as good a method as any to educate the world on Islam and its treatment of women. What happens in \"Osama\", the summary execution of women via stoning, the brutal beatings and imprisonments, the slavery trade, and all manner of beastly practices anyone in the West would consider beyond the pale, occurs in these countries all of the time.<br /><br />The question one asks, given the increasing percentage of Muslims in the E.U., the increasing practice of \"honor killings\", the frequent rioting by Asian \"youths\", the routine harassment of Jews and Gays by Muslims in the E.U. countries, and the increasing acceptance of Sharia law by the secular E.U. authorities to accommodate the growing Islamic population, how long will it be before the great democracies of Western Europe look like Afghanistan?

The baby sitter is totally oblivious to the vampire\\'s appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror, has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult, and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child.

Dooley does not get along with his new partner much either. That all changes as the movie goes along. The movie is intense as their is a guy that really wants to kill Dooley for the way he treated him in the past. There is some dramatic scenes dealing with the death of Dooley's wife that don't really seem to be with the tone of the movie because the rest of the movie is action sequences, dog poop jokes, fart jokes, and jokes about dogs biting bad guys in a certain area. I know that that seems like very low humor, but some of it is actually very funny. I didn't see this movie for the jokes, I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is because I am a big James Belushi fan and the second is for the action sequences. James Belushi is funnier than he was in K-9 and the action sequences at are better too. It would have been nice to see more characters from K-9 to return, but it's still a fun movie.

As a testament to the suffering of the ordinary soldier on the Eastern Front in the Second World War, it is a powerful one. There are a number of very powerful scenes in the film which help to capture the horror of war, such as the tank battle for instance. Furthermore, from what I can see the experiences documented in the film are by and large 'true' - if you read A. Beevor's book 'Stalingrad' you will know what I mean. The film is also successful in the sense that it doesn't allow character or plot to dominate it - it is simply a tale of survival, that attempts to depict the battle mainly from the ordinary (German) soldier's point of view. I've read somewhere that the original screenplay had to be toned down, which doesn't surprise me at all - if they tried to really show what the battle was like, it would have been almost impossible to make I'm sure. Even so, there are still some moments that are difficult to watch - this was made before Private Ryan but is possibly even harder-hitting in places. Just one word of caution - don't buy the dubbed 'English' version, it's pretty awful and spoils the film - try to get a copy in the original (German) version with English subtitles, it's far more powerful. You may need to buy a Region 1 DVD of the film in this case, as I did.\",\n"," 'Kiki and Clo-Clo (I just love these names.) are rivals in a nightclub act. To upstage Clo-Clo, Kiki\\'s boyfriend arranges for her to enter the club with a black leopard on a leash while Clo-Clo is performing. But things don\\'t go as planned and the leopard escapes. Later that night, a young woman is killed outside her home by a leopard. More deaths of women are blamed on the leopard. But is it really the leopard that\\'s responsible for the deaths or is a maniac using the leopard as a cover to commit murder? <br /><br />The Leopard Man has an unusual story structure that I find very appealing. Most of the events in the movie and most of the people (or victims) we meet occur through the movements of Clo-Clo. As she walks through the streets, she runs into or passes seemingly random persons. We are immediately taken into their world for a brief glimpse of their lives before the inevitable occurs. It\\'s the realization that these people are unknowingly in danger because of a chance meeting with Clo-Clo and they can do nothing about it that creates much of the suspense in The Leopard Man.<br /><br />The Leopard Man features some of the best set-pieces and scenes Val Lewton ever put together. The death of the first girl, Teresa, is the most obvious example. To get home, Teresa must go through a tunnel knowing full well that a leopard has escaped and may be inside ready to pounce. This scene is nothing short of scary. It\\'s one of the most frightening moments from a Lewton movie. Teresa finally reaches home but is unable to get inside the house. Before her mother and brother can get the door open, Teresa is attacked. The camera pans to the floor to show the blood running into the house. It\\'s a very chilling moment and one of the best that Lewton ever made.<br /><br />Most of Lewton\\'s films have a \"look\" to them that I find very pleasing. In this department, The Leopard Man doesn\\'t disappoint. Everything from the \"noirish\" look of the city streets to the use of shadows to create atmosphere gives these movies part of their distinctiveness. Lewton couldn\\'t afford fancy special effects or high-priced actors, so he made up for this by creating some of the most visually stunning movies I\\'ve seen. In short, The Leopard Man is a real treat to the eye.',\n"," \"The film that gave us John Waters is one of the funniest films ever.

Cerchi gets some credit for still making gore flicks while most of the other Italian directors (Ruggero Deodato, Sergio Martino, Lamberto Bava, and Enzo G. Castellari) have moved on to lower-key TV movies. As for plankton, it's half Piranha - half The Thing, with people turninging into monsters, raping women, and causing general mayhem. The ultra-grimy, sleazy, and over-sexed feel of the film makes it hard to enjoy. Only available in Italian language work-prints floating around.\",\n"," 'In the days before gore and sex took over, real horror films were made. Castle of Blood is, in my estimation, one of the finest, although other reviewers have given it mixed ratings. In an odd sort of way it reminds of the more recent The Others, which was in the theaters a couple of years ago.<br /><br />Director Antonio Margheriti remade his own picture in 1970 titling it this time Web of the Spider (AKA Nella Stretta Morsa del Ragno). Why he did this I do not understand, although the remake starred Anthony Franciosa and Klaus Kinski and was very good in its own right. Perhaps he saw a good story and wished to tailor it more to American audiences. I do not really know. It is interesting that he did the original in black and white and the remake in color.<br /><br />Castle of Blood is excellent Italian Gothic. La Danza Macabra is said to be an unpublished work of Edgar Allen Poe, who \"appears\" in this film. Poe and Lord Blackwood, owner of a haunted castle, bet American writer Alan Foster (George Riviere) that he cannot spend All Souls Night in said castle and survive. Foster eagerly accepts the bet but soon regrets it, for he is witness to a series of murders committed by ghosts. It seems that the ghosts come back to life once every few years but are doomed to re-enact the crimes they committed in life. Lord Blackwood conveniently forgot to tell Foster that his blood is needed for them to resurrect themselves on the next All Souls Night! <br /><br />It does not take Foster and the beautiful Elisabeth Blackwood (portrayed by the incomparable Barbara Steele) long to fall in love, even though their romance is doomed, because Elisabeth is one of the ghosts. I will not give the ending away, but will just say that Castle of Blood is every bit a romantic tragedy as it is a horror story. <br /><br />Comments. This film is greatly atmospheric, even by the excellent standards of the Italians. My personal opinion is they do true horror better than anybody, and the somewhat dim black and white filming only enhances this. In fairness, Web of the Spider was fine in its own right, even with color and greater brightness. I loved the lingering shots, something most modern day directors do not have the patience for. Indeed, when Alan first enters the doomed castle, we are treated to several minutes of him doing nothing but roaming around from room to room, the dread ands unease building in his face and mannerisms. By the time the first ghost appears, the audience is thoroughly primed and ready. There is wonderful dialogue between Alan and the ghosts, something else not often done in standard ghost stories. There are also memorable scenes, very visual for this type of film. Elisabeth\\'s \"murder\" and the dance scene (reminds somewhat of the similar dance of the ghouls in 1962\\'s Carnival of Souls) were particularly good.<br /><br />Sadly, few general interest viewers will ever hear of, much less see, this film.

While not especially clear here, it appears as if Daddy has been \"renting\" his daughter\\'s body out for a long time.<br /><br />However, after nearly being raped and attacking this man by breaking a bottle of beer over his skull, Barbara has had enough and heads to the big city. It doesn\\'t hurt that the still blew up and killed her father, but her feeling that she was whoring herself out and had nothing to show for it appeared to be the impetus to move.<br /><br />Despite the Depression, Barbara uses sex to get a job at a huge mega-bank. She starts out at a pretty menial job as a file clerk, but in the space of what seems like just a few weeks, she sleeps her way from one job to another to yet another--until she is sleeping with the head of the bank and his future son-in-law!!! This all ends in tragedy, but Babs doesn\\'t seem too shook up over the deaths of these two men. In fact, some time later, she is able to insinuate herself into the life of the NEW CEO and once again she\\'s on top (perhaps in more way than one).<br /><br />Now so far, this is a wonderful movie because it was so gritty and unrepentant. Barbara played a 100% sociopath--a woman with no morality and no conscience--just a desire to squeeze as much out of life as she could no matter who she hurt in the process. However, the brave writers and producer \"chickened out\" and thought it important to tack on a redemptive ending. Considering that this woman was so evil and conniving, her change of heart at the end was a major disappointment and strongly detracted from the film. In many ways, this reminded me of the ending of JEZEBEL--as once again, a wicked person somehow \"sees the light\" and changes at the not-too-convincing conclusion.<br /><br />My advice is to try watching RED-HEADED WOMAN and DOWNSTAIRS. RED-HEADED WOMAN is much like BABY FACE but features no magical transformation at the end--the leading lady really is a skunk down deep! In DOWNSTAIRS, a film very much like RED-HEADED WOMAN, the roles are reversed and a man (John Gilbert) plays a similar conniving character. Both are classics and a bit better than this film.<br /><br />This film is an amazing curio of a brief period of often ultra-sleazy Hollywood films and in this light it\\'s well worth seeing for Cinephiles. Also, fans of The Duke take note--John Wayne plays a very small part in the film and it\\'s very unusual to see a very young Wayne playing such a conventional role.',\n"," \"In 1983, Director Brian De Palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an American gangster, and that he did-- with the help of a terrific screenplay by Oliver Stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast. The result was `Scarface,' starring Al Pacino in one of his most memorable roles. The story begins in May of 1980, when Castro opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba, to allow Cuban nationals to join their families in the United States. 125,000 left Cuba at that time, for the greener pastures of freedom in America, and most were honest, hard-working people, thankful for the opportunity they had been granted. But not all. Among the `Marielitos' who streamed into Florida, approximately 25,000 had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of Cuba's jails-- criminals considered beyond redemption, who Castro had merely wanted to be rid of. And they, too, saw America as a land of opportunity, even as Al Capone had considered Chicago some fifty years earlier. And among the most ambitious was a man named Tony Montana (Pacino), known to his associates as `Caracortada.' Scarface.<br /><br />Now that he was free of the yoke of Communism under which he had grown up, Montana wanted what he felt was coming to him, and he wanted it now; and from the moment he stepped off the boat in Florida, he was determined to have it all. Wealth and power-- that was Montana's dream, and he would get it by doing what he did best, beginning with a favor for a man living in Miami by the name of Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia). Lopez, it seems, had a brother in Cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of Castro's goons, a man who, having outlived his usefulness to Castro, had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in `Little Havana,' along with Montana and all of the Cubans just off the boats, where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives. And in short order, Montana sees to it that Lopez's brother has been avenged, and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of America.<br /><br />Lopez, a wealthy businessman with the right connections, in return for the favor gets Montana and his friend, Manny (Steven Bauer), released from the holding camp, and puts them to work. In his day, Capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain, but Lopez has the modern day equivalent, and it's even more lucrative: Cocaine. Lopez takes Montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into the life, but once he has a taste of it, Montana isn't satisfied with whatever crumbs Lopez sees fit to throw his way, and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be: At the `top.' With a cold-blooded, iron will, Montana decides he'll do whatever it takes to get there, no matter what the cost. but before it's over, he will realize the price for his dream, and he'll pay it; but for a brief moment, perhaps he will know what it's like to be The Man. And he will also know whether or not it was worth it.<br /><br />In step with De Palma's vision, Pacino plays Montana larger-than-life, and he does it beautifully. From the accent he affects (which he researched thoroughly to make sure he got it right-- and he did), to the body language and the attitude, he's got it all, and it makes Montana convincing and very real. What he brings to the role is nuance and style, in a way that few actors (De Niro would be one) can. This is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way, nor is there anything about Montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level; but Pacino's screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character, even though it's hard to become emotionally involved with him. It's quite simply a dynamic, memorable performance.<br /><br />Michelle Pfeiffer gives a solid performance, as well, in the role that put her on the path to stardom. As Elvira, the woman who becomes an integral part of Montana's dream, Pfeiffer is subtle and understated, giving that sense of something going on underneath, while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior countenance. She, like Pacino, definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly glides across the screen with a stoic, enigmatic and sultry demeanor.<br /><br />The supporting cast includes Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Gina), Miriam Colon (Mama Montana), F. Murray Abraham (Omar), Paul Shenar (Sosa) and Harris Yulin (Bernstein). An excellent precursor to the more recent and highly acclaimed `Traffic,' and `Blow,' and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of Peckinpah's `The Wild Bunch,' De Palma's `Scarface,' originally panned by critics, has since been cited by many as being the definitive American gangster saga. Much of the violence is implied rather than graphic, but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing. But if you stay with it, there is a lesson to be learned in the end. And like many lessons in life, the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time. But the reward is always worth it, and that's the way it is with this film. I rate this one 8/10. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />\",\n"," \"just saw this exquisite 1982 movie Return of the Soldier, based on Rebecca West's novel. Its about a shell-shocked fortyish Captain who doesn't even tell his wife he has returned to British soil, but remains in a hospital in London. He's lost his memory and is a boy again, with a lingering yen for the lower class sweetheart he pursued 25 years earlier. Its a delicate story. He is lingering in his boyhood, while the reader discovers his wife is an unbearable, aspiring socialite who wants him to resume his place in society. Living with them is his cousin Jenny, who loved Chris Baldry the soldier, when they were growing up as playmates, but has settled into spinsterhood. The lower class woman, played by Glenda Jackson, is Margaret Gray. It is SHE who is notified that Chris is back in England. Chris' wife Kitty is shocked when Mrs. Gray comes to tell her that Chris is in a hospital in London. Kitty (Julie Christie) is vacuous and snobbish. Why, she asks herself, was this other woman sent a telegraph about Chris rather than her? Chris has forgotten totally about Kitty. He wants to renew his relationship with Margaret. The now married Margaret is reluctant to meet him, but then does and continues to meet with him. There is a psychiatrist (Ian Holm) who warns Kitty and Jenny that Chris' temporary happiness with Margaret will disappear if he 'cures' him. Jenny realizes how empty Kitty is for Chris and forms a secret loving alliance through Margaret. They both are in love with him. Jenny wants to help. Late in the film Kitty reveals that Chris and she had a boy who died five years ago. Telling Chris this, weighs the Shrink, will certainly restore him to 'normal.' But is this a good idea? Chris, barely aware that he and Kitty were ever married, is unaware of his child and the child's death. The psychiatrist, just learning of the child, believes such knowledge will restore Chris. Jenny and Margaret have Chris all to themselves because Kitty believes he is faking and refuses to accept Chris's illness in reverting to his youth in his forties. The film leaves her mostly out of consideration concerning whats to be done with Chris.<br /><br />But Jenny and Margaret, in the child's perfectly maintained bedroom- with Kitty too in the novel, but not in the screenplay- discuss what they believe should be done about Chris from their separate perspectives. Margaret is the critical one here, because, though married, she has half fallen in love with Chris again. Jenny's social stature, Jenny believes, will be threatened if Chris does not right himself. She does not reveal this to Margaret, however. Margaret decides, looking ahead, that Chris cannot maintain his fantasy over time, but must return to something like a real life. While Kitty and Jenny look on from the window of the house, Margaret approaches Chris outside and tells him of his lost son. The buoyant war victim's head sinks, his shoulders slump, he looks away. He walks dejectedly toward the house. Fin<br /><br />I read some criticism of this first novel of Rebecca West. The novel was written something after the first war. The movie is never quite clear who Jenny is, his cousin or his sister. It would be more rousing if she were his sister, of course. The criticism doesn't make it clear either. I'm sure West in her novel, makes sure Jenny is her cousin, not her sister. West is no Henry Miller nor an Anais Nin, whose book Incest (about her relationship with her father as an adult to get even with him for molesting her as a child) I considered reading, but then decided against. Rebecca the author has a need to restore Chris too. She too has outposts in her head for the Society her novel excoriates first but finally embraces once more.\",\n"," 'Hey you wanna know what I hate? Lines of dialogue like this:<br /><br />\"You been away from the dark realm a while, Chels, how\\'d it feel playin\\' again?\"<br /><br />\"Just like any other ultra-violent twenty-four hour wildly popular and yet utterly purposeless embraced-by-the-masses Internet role-playing game.\"<br /><br />It\\'s one of those lines of dialogue that they always put into movies like Hellraiser 8 that are impossible to avoid sounding like they were written and re-written and rehearsed and re- rehearsed and then finally they just give up trying to make it sound natural after 30 or 40 takes and, exasperated, just drop the best bad take into the movie. That, being said, let me tell you what I have figured out.<br /><br />After years if deliberation about what it takes to make a good horror movie and what is missing in a bad one, after countless theories (the presence of teenagers or college-age kids being near the top of that list, by the way), I have finally discovered for certain the exact point at which a movie stops being scary and good and instantly becomes stupid and bad. There is a perfect illustration of the solution near the end of this film, when Chelsea gets locked in the room and Adam starts calling to her from under the floor. <br /><br />She has becomes absorbed in some photo album despite having found herself locked into the creepiest attic imaginable, and she hears someone whispering her name from behind her. She spins around just in time to see a hand disappear beneath a crack in the floorboards, and she cautiously moves over to investigate. As she peers into the hole, she continues to hear her name being called and she can see the tiniest glimpse of a face in the darkness, and at this point I am absolutely cringing in my chair. No matter how sure I am that something is going to spring out in a situation like that it still gets to me. <br /><br />And then she did something stupid.<br /><br />Literally the instant Chelsea put her hand through that crack in the floorboards, I immediately relaxed, almost to the point of breathing a sigh of relief because I didn\\'t have to worry anymore because I completely stopped caring. And it\\'s not just because she doesn\\'t realize she\\'s in a horror movie (despite the fact that the entire cast of this movie are hardcore Hellraiser fans, so the fourth wall has already been breached), it\\'s because the moment her hand crosses the threshold of that crack in the boards she instantly ceases to be a victim.<br /><br />And you know what my analogy is? Suicide! When someone in a horror movie does something that stupid, it is generally because the filmmakers need to have the character killed off but can\\'t think of a really clever way to have it happen, so they just have the character do something monumentally stupid, but the problem is that this places the blame for their death on themselves, and in a horror movie, it\\'s not only not scary when someone is attacked after doing something as idiotic as putting her hand through the crack in the floorboards because she thinks she sees her dead friend down there, it\\'s satisfying, and not in the good way either. <br /><br />Stupidity should be painful, but in the movies, it should be lethal. <br /><br />That being said, it\\'s amazing how little effort was made into making it clear what exactly was going on in the movie. It starts out with the funeral of a college age kid having been killed because of his over-involvement in something called Hellworld, which itself is never very clearly explained. His friends later mourn that they all knew what was happening to him but still kept playing Hellworld, although if you watch the making-of featurettes on the DVD, Director Rick Bota refers to Hellworld as \"a website, or video game.\" It\\'s kind of an ominous sign when even the director doesn\\'t know what his movie is about. Either that or he doesn\\'t know the difference between a website and a video game. <br /><br />The story follows the death of their friend, something about that game, and then cuts to a few years later when all of his friends get invited to a party celebrating the said video game. Needless to say, it\\'s kind of like an overblown Halloween party where everyone seems to be fascinated with the macabre (serious macabre, too, like dead babies in jars, sounds like a blast), and girls randomly pull their breasts out (curiously, the first bit of wildly gratuitous nudity is followed by the following exchange \\x96 \"Gratuitous breasts?\" \"Necessary breasts! Ha ha ha!\" Clever.). <br /><br />When all is said and done and you finally realize what has been happening throughout the entire movie, it is such a ludicrous and ridiculous twist that it distantly surpasses the Saw movies for absurdity. If you thought Jigsaw had some time on his hands to come up with some incredibly complex machines of torture, wait until you see the plot that is hatched by the Host (played by Lance Henriksen, who wastes his talent completely in this movie). <br /><br />Also don\\'t miss the making-of featurette on the DVD, in which you can witness Pinhead eating a piece of pizza and, my favorite, Khary Payton, one of the actors in the film, makes the following mysterious analogy \\x96 \"Horror movies are like roller coasters, you know, they\\'re not gonna win Oscars or that kind of thing, but they\\'re just a lot of fun.\"<br /><br />I don\\'t know, Khary, have you ridden Xtreme at Magic Mountain in Southern California?

OK, good idea. I\\'d watch the movie based on that.<br /><br />The movie is slow from start to finish. I don\\'t mind slow movies with a purpose. King Kong, for example, is slow in the beginning, yet I love it. 2001: A Space Odessy and The Birds are very slow, yet I find them good movies. This movie was slow because of poor writing. If you want to see some well done writing that is done in real time (1 hr video is 1 hr of story), watch 24.<br /><br />But it goes down hill rapidly.

There is a certain joy of life depicted in this film that is in some ways also bittersweet (and yet refreshing). What is sad in some regards now is the realization upon seeing it again that the era of life portrayed here is now gone from the collective American psyche to some extent. That isn't to say the film is dated per se. It's just that Melvin isn't cynical at all and he doesn't seem to have a hateful bone in his body. He's neither a wimp nor a man of intellect but someone whose basic humanity emanates. <br /><br />What helps the film, too, is the pairing of actors Paul LeMat as Melvin, and Mary Steenburgen as Melvin's wife, Linda -- they are an endearing couple. <br /><br />I attribute the film's memorable tone and spirit to not only the actors (including Jason Robards & some of the supporting cast) -- I like to believe that director, Jonathan Demme, put his stamp on this, too. Now in retrospect am learning that the writer (Bo Goldman) probably deserves some kudos.\",\n"," \"The Petrified Forest is a philosophically romantic story of life in the most desolate places, hence the title. It's set in the Petrified Forest area in northern Arizona. An intellectual hitchhiker played by Trevor Howard drifts into a roadside diner run by a proud, traditionalist man, his dreamy daughter Bette Davis, and her grandfather, an old man with a lot of stories about the old days and a fascination with outlaws.<br /><br />When Davis's mother moved back to France when she was a young child, she felt like everything in her heart moved there with her, leaving her an empty shell of herself living with her stern, purist father. Davis reads poetry, dreams about visiting Bourges and wants to study art. But she's in a dry, dead nowhere working a tedious job and being pursued stubbornly by hunky jocks. When Howard arrives, he is so much more schooled and wise, having been all around the world, and by that mere background, he draws naturally in to conversation with strangers beyond small talk and eventually focuses in on the one fit to enter his adventurous, idealistic, strangely humble existence. That eventual focus is the character of Bette Davis, his lone waitress, out of her element, to whom he expresses interest in seeing her paintings and hearing her recite her favorite poem. To Howard, who appears to sees himself as an unsuccessful writer, she is the future and he finds her enthusiasm and optimism both endearing and revitalizing.<br /><br />Hurtling headlong into this nonentity of a world is Humphrey Bogart, nailing the rotten-to- the-core persona of his character, a wanted gangster, who with his gang of ruffians, holds everyone in the diner hostage. However, some of life's dead skin has been blistered and peeled back. Trevor Howard gets to the heart of exchanging stimulating words with the stoic villain of Bogart, and makes an agreement with him. With Davis out of the room by chance, Howard signs over an insurance policy to her and asks Bogie to shoot him. His rationalization is that he is of no use to a rose in need of watering like Davis if he is alive. The world simply does not seem as if to work that way. If he is dead, however, she can live her dreams.<br /><br />Like Howard's individualist protagonist, the film is a profound compromise. It does not settle for a film noir. It does not settle for a love story. Even involving one's subject matter with another's in the same plot may remain within one genre, one conventional environment. By not so much combining the two but rather looking both ways in perceiving an impression of the world, Robert E. Sherwood and those who adapted his play, stages a confrontation between the two outlooks, holding them up side by side and relating their shocking compatibility. That is what is very special about The Petrified Forest. For a picture made in the 1930s, it is exceptionally written and acted, a timeless work of eagerness and tenderness amidst peers which were poles apart.\",\n"," 'True Love, I truly enjoyed and LOVED this movie.

Unlike other war films that focus on the event, Apocalypse Now takes the viewer into a psychological head trip. The sheer surrealism makes the body uncomfortable, yet you can\\'t lay your eyes off of it. Based off of Joseph Conrad\\'s Heart Of Darkness, Apocalypse Now slowly descends its protagonist, Willard (Martin Sheen) into madness, most likely the same way Kurtz plunged into insanity. The production of this film is notorious for its delays provided by the monsoon season and for Brando\\'s unprepared performance (he read his lines from cue cards). There is a documentary titled Apocalypse Now: A filmmakers Apocalypse which shows the hell everyone went through in making this.<br /><br />The opening sequence is one of the most famous and popular in any film. As the blade of the helicopters are heard in slow motion and napalm is dropped in the trees, the song \"The End\" by the Doors can be heard. The next shot is of Willard in his bed with the fan on, so the noise of the helicopter coincides with the fan. We are informed that he does special missions for the military, mostly assassinations. When his next mission is given to him, he is baffled. \"Charging a man with murder here is like giving a speeding ticket in the Indy 500.\" The man he has to kill was a respected colonel that has gone insane and isolated himself along with tribes people. Kurtz is ordering atrocious acts that are carried out by these people and he must me stopped. Willard does not go alone however. He is carried on a boat with several soldiers and they come across several battles. Along the way, they meet Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore \"Hoorah\" about the war. Willard ponders that if Kilgore is that crazy, what could Kurtz be like. There are many scenes that portray Willards plunge into insanity: The tiger attack, the slaughter of innocent Vietnamese, the nonstop rain, the piled dead bodies scattered about, and the deaths of his crew members. When he reaches the Kurtz compound, he is greeted by the village people and a hippie photojournalist (Dennis Hopper). Instead of assassinating Kurtz right away, Willard begins talking with him and his conscience begins to doubt what he should do. Kurtz, on the other hand wants to die. He is tired of the war and wants to go down as a soldier. Willard kills him with a machete while in unison, a buffalo is sacrificed with several machetes by the people. Once they realize their leader has been slain, instead of killing Willard, they hail him as their new king. Willard rejects the offer and leaves them.<br /><br />The cinematography here is absolutely breathtaking. The colors are grain free, something that is rare in older movies. I can watch it muted and admire the beauty of the scenery.<br /><br />The acting ensemble is terrific, with everyone playing their parts well. Many criticize Brando for some reason, but I think he nails his role as a depressed lunatic who is beaten up by the war.<br /><br />The soundtrack and the score are haunting, and provide the mood for the film. I am wondering what instrument they used in that guitar-like sound when the credits roll? There have been many parodies of this film, but my favorite quote comes from Marge Simpson when she explains to Homer why a character with the same name on a police show is behaving like an idiot: \"Your character provides comic relief for the show, like um, Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now.\" Those who have seen the movie know why this is hilarious.',\n"," \"Without comparing this to any other zombie film out there, this was one of the worst movies I've ever watched. The acting was bad, and that could be attributed to this being the actors first film ever. The lighting was very very bad, it appears throughout the movie that they are trying to use natural lighting, if that's the case, why shoot the film in shady areas or late in the day? Most of the time you can't see the actors expressions or faces because of the shadows. The special effects are horrible in most places, sometimes the blood is red, sometimes it's black. You see a lot of blood that looks black and congealed running out of one wound while there's fresh red blood running out of another wound (This being on the same body at the same time).

First of all the movie is starring Lizzy McGuire's brother as the annoying little kid that goes looking for his lost 3 legged dog. Now please what kind of dumb ass mistakes a three-legged dog for a god damn mutated crocodile please I ask you? And heres another point for pondering, why do they show the Dinocroc on the back of the movie box being enormous and actually in the water? I believe if memory serves the thing spent about 2.6 minutes in the water and was just shy of 6 feet tall, that was a heart breaker. But redeeming qualities to this movie were that it was so bad that i almost died laughing because believe me the bad acting made me wish for death. But the fact remains that once again this thing is created by another military testing site to train super crocodiles for military combat or something like that from the source of all things evil E.V.I.L Corporation. And let's not forget the characters let's see we have jerk off #1 as the male lead and half way decent chick (who doesn't know how to act) as the female lead to that I say WOW! The only thing worse then the acting was the end of course the heroes spend about what seems like 2 hours talking and planning some long elaborate way of killing the dinocroc only to have it fail and kill it in an ordinary way that could have taken about 15 seconds to come up with. All in all this movie was beyond gay with its random opera music in the background and the fact that it was probably the gayest of all CGI monsters ever made along with the fact it of course was impervious to bullets and bombs (otherwise it wouldn't have been made for the military DUH!). By far the best scene was when Lizzy McGuire's brother runs into the shack and the dinocroc eats him causing his head to pop clean off with a popping noise i might add. I believe that you would be better off shooting yourself between the eyes then to watch Dinocroc. And as for the director I believe that we should get a bunch of people to hang him by a noose and all take turns kicking him in the crotch for wasting an hour and a half of our lives until he finally dies and then I can go on living.\",\n"," \"What the crap were they thinking?!?!

Maybe he was not as accomplished as his good old dad, Alexandra Dumas Fils made his own work a classic household name which is well-remembered and appreciated.<br /><br />I first heard about \"Cha Fa Nui\" (Camille) from the mouth of my mother when I was still an upper primary school girl. To a young Chinese girl, this meant nothing at all but I went to the public library and found that there were many copies with this title translated by Taiwanese. I never finished reading it because the names are too long and the Chinese is too literary, I was bored to death by it. The only thing I remembered was that it was a French novel. Dropped, the book, but not the name.<br /><br />A few years later in the early 80\\'s, Franco Zeffirelli\\'s operatic movie with Chinese title as \"Cha Fa Nui\" was on show in one and only one movie house, \"Palace\" at Causeway Bay (demolished!). At that time, this prestigious cinema showed mostly western movies of big names like Gone with the Wind, Casablanca, Dr. Zhivago and so \"La Traviata\" was one of them.<br /><br />Hong Kong Chinese were then not very familiar with Western culture, the cinema staff had even misplaced Plácido Domingo\\'s name as \"Domingo Plácido\" on the billboard. I, as a teenager, was a little intimidated by the movie house by its reputation and grandeur. Yet, out of curiosity, in those fearless, carefree and innocent days, imitating the adults with good taste, I bought a ticket to see this movie. And it was a WOW, what an eye-opening experience!<br /><br />The vision, the music, the powerful opera singing, the acting and the poetic cinematography, the wondrous costumes and hairdo, it was an educational adventure to a young life. (So, until now I still don\\'t understand how come the man at one row before me could be sleeping and snoring so annoyingly while his girlfriend/wife/sister was staring hard on the screen without moving her head.) Everything is unforgettable about this movie. The happy time of the lovers that Violetta once fell off into a shallow brook from the narrow wood plank. The histrionic and comical fit of Alfredo when he was struggle to open that fateful letter from Violetta. And the most excruciating of all, I can still feel the deafening horror that the deserted and seriously ill Violetta was standing desertedly in the cruelly empty and stripped big house, letting out piercing shriek of pain.<br /><br />The subsequent episode is an educational search for me: I looked for abridged version of \"Cha Fa Nui\" in English \"Camille\" and found out that the names of the original protagonists were Marguerite Gautier and Armand Duval but not those in the operatic adaptation as Violetta Valery and Alfredo Germont. Furthermore, the book inspired Giuseppe Verdi first to make it into an opera but not Franco Zeffirelli\\'s movie.<br /><br />And five years later, I learned some French and so, dared to touched the original \"La Dame aux Camélias\". Later, I learnt from an Italian lady that the name of Verdi\\'s opera \"La Traviata\" was derived from an Italian verb \"traviare\" which means \"to mislead\", \"to lead astray\", or \"to corrupt\". Thus, a \"corrupted man\" is a \"traviato\" and so \"the fallen woman\" or \"the corrupted woman\" is \"La Traviata\". And the book has inspired every generation\\'s film-makers or TV producers, so far there are more than forty adaptations. Well, well, well, what a job all through the years.<br /><br />What\\'s more interesting, I once read from an oddly-enough page about the Brits\\' Prince Charles. It is reported that his favourite opera is \"La Traviata\", and my eyebrows arched.

But this is just as humans are, not even Buddhist priests can be saints all the time.<br /><br />When irony is at last introduced into the film, it is the nastiest possible, emanating from the \\'abbot\\' of Red Lotus Temple, who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before.

Thus there\\'s a definite sense pervading the Red Temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the Temple itself - it has become all there is to the universe, and the Abbot, claiming mastery of infinite power, is in charge.<br /><br />Of course, fortunately, the film doesn\\'t end there.

At the same time, however, we cringe at the horror Hamlet feels at his betrayal--far more than with any other actor--because Jacobi feels the pain more profoundly than anyone else. And we shudder at Hamlet's own betrayals, because Jacobi is not afraid of the baseness to which Hamlet can descend.

Now, finally he\\'s killed off and good riddance.They put in Mark Dacascos who really should have been in the sequel. He\\'s a real martial artist with a strong build, unlike Satcha Mitchell who\\'s a skinny B-grade actor, with no physique. I was actually glad to see David Sloane die as I never felt he deserved to live off Kurt\\'s success. Now the David Sloane fans feel like all the other movies were pointless as he was going to die anyway. Well that\\'s how us Van Damme fans felt in the sequel. They felt it was still a good movie despite being without Van Damme, well we fell this is a good one despite no Satcha Mitchell. I hope you feel as angry and annoyed as we were now that David was killed off so easily and cheaply as Van Damme was in the sequel. So enjoy this movie, cause David Sloane is never coming back!

Keeping in the stoner-addled tradition of things in fact, one may even squeeze off a few scatological belly laughs in the otherwise depressingly low-brow, low budget affair. Apparently it boils down to this: Writer/Director Bob Saget has a lot of friends in Hollywood. They may not all be on top of their game, many even out of the limelight for some time, but a common friend indeed they have with their oft-ridiculed, former television dork dad.<br /><br />What Saget gets to exploit out of this is a plethora of B-listers, which makes for an impressive cast on paper\\x85.but do not be fooled. On top of the disengaging sound quality which reeks of home studio, almost all of the frequent one line cameos done by celebrities are so apathetically subdued that one cannot help but think most of these people are phoning in a favor to an old Hollywood friend, with absolutely no intention on getting any attention in this project; who can blame them? Even at 80 minutes, relying on a low grade stash of penguin stock footage in order to manipulate a crude plot into this joke must have sounded drastically unappealing to most participants.<br /><br />Thankfully a few of Saget's crew actually rise to the occasion, that is to say that they do not let their hubris get in the way of embracing the full-on stupidity of the project. It is in those low-fi moments of tasteless class that a few voice actors and the rancid production actually get to shine in it's context. Samuel L. Jackson, as the narrator was an excellent choice, although even his central dialog feels like his head is somewhere else (to the scripts credit, they actually throw in a joke to echo this sentiment). The only other voice actors that make an earnest contribution to this goof are Lewis Black (who thankfully had a large role) and Tracey Morgan, making all other voice actors seem completely indifferent. For the few genuinely hilarious moments that reached further then this trite March of the Penguins farce, I am unexpectedly happy for, but for a majority of screen time, viewers need either be indulging their chemical dependencies, or mocking aloud with friends in order to receive anything special out of this shell of a movie.\",\n"," \"The more I watch this movie, the more I love it.

To be honest, today is also a good time to be a swinger but it just felt more daring then.<br /><br />Joe Sarno offers up a pretty good soft-core film. In fact, just like today, some of the actors are famous hardcore actors. Unlike today, these people were good actors and these films had a plot and character development.<br /><br />It\\'s pretty much what you would expect out of a swinger\\'s movie. Two couples with open relationships re-ignite the wanderlust out of the MILF of one of the women who has come for a visit. Not much more to it.<br /><br />Of course, when the MILF is Jennifer Welles then it is a different story. Not too many 40-somethings look as delicious undressed as Ms. Welles.

She\\'s way sexier.<br /><br />I also digged Chris Jordan\\'s Anna. Jordan looks and sounds so much like Elaine Joyce that I thought she might be her \"separated at birth\" twin or even Elaine herself.

Gold Diggers of 1933, 42nd Street and Footlight Parade were all set in the world of Broadway Theatre with basically the same theme of the show must go on. In addition to Keeler and Powell the films featured the kaleidiscopic choreography of Busby Berkeley, show stopping tunes and many of the same supporting players.<br /><br />All are arguably classics of their genre but I must admit a clear preference for Footlight due to it's pace energy and lead James Cagney. Warren William in Gold Diggers and Warner Baxter in 42nd Street acquit themselves admirably as the shows production heads- particularly Baxter as the burned out Julian Marsh in search of one last box office smash. Both lack the infectious energy of Cagney however, who perfectly compliments the frenetic pace of putting on a Broadway musical. He is an absolute whirlwind as he deals with production numbers, unscrupulous partners and a gold digging girlfriend.<br /><br />Of course Cagney alone does not make Footlight the classic that it is. The script crackles with some sharp double entendres delivered by a superlative supporting cast featuring Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibbee and especially Joan Blondell who cuts everyone down to size. Busby Berkeley's dance numbers are surreal, suggestive and risqué and done just in the nick of time before the arrival of the Hollywood Code in 34. Sadly, the thirties and sometime beyond would never see such a richly made musical with the verve and sass of Footlight again. Gentility and morality made sure of it.\",\n"," \"The movie Contagion was a very low budget and horribly made movie. If they where not so cheap and chose to actually spend some money on some decent actors the film would not have been so bad. During the whole movie it reminded me of the movie outbreak which was actually OK and I think this movie tried to be like that. The only good actor in the whole movie was the sketchy little kid that crawled through the air vent to get every where, why couldn't he just walk? I would never recommend this movie to anyone unless you have to watch and even then I am still sorry for you. The up side to the movie Contagion is that it was actually kind of amusing at some points in the movie, and I believe that it wasn't suppose to be funny. I loved how when one of the doctors was studying the virus she started to rub her eyes and mouth with the same gloves that she was studying the virus with. This movie is not even good enough to have a chance to be played on the sci fi channel, which is bad because they play some really bad movies on there.\",\n"," 'Let\\'s get things straight. I was raised Catholic, and in a very religious family, and spent as much time at church and talking to priests as at home. That was useful for two things: to make a convinced Atheist out of me, and to give me deep, insightful knowledge about the Church and its dogmas. And I say: if a Catholic priest witnesses a murder, and clearly sees the face of the killer, he CAN report it to the police, even if the murderer has confessed to him afterwards. He can not reveal what he\\'s told in confession, but he CAN talk about anything he sees outside that, and confession is useless to keep his mouth shut. So, here we have a movie entirely sustained on a lie. And another lie is there\\'s no absolution for murder. According to the Catholic Church, there\\'s absolution for any sin as long as there\\'s sincere repentance. So far, the biggest plot holes in this weak thriller.<br /><br />As people frequently say, this movie would have improved if Bob Hoskins and Alan Bates had switched roles. Hoskins is naturally suitable to play gangsters (I will never lament enough that he lost Al Capone in favor of one of De Niro\\'s weakest performances in \"The Untouchables\") and Bates\\' features would have been perfect as the priest with a gray past. But above that, I think the film would have been much better had real-life Ulster native Liam Neeson (back then mostly unknown to big audiences) played Mickey Rourke\\'s part. Not only his face is perfect to play tormented characters, but he\\'d make us believe the character as real, something Rourke just can\\'t. Back in the 80s, Rourke was not a bad actor (afterwards he seemed to lose his talent along with his looks), but he was one of those performers, like Brad Dourif, who\\'s as good as the director he works with. And as a former IRA terrorist, Rourke\\'s acting comes across more like a pimp. Sad to think that, had this movie been made just some three to six years later (when Neeson achieved moderate celebrity status in 1990 with Sam Raimi\\'s enjoyable \"Darkman\", and superstardom in 1993 with \"Schindler\\'s List\", while Rourke became pretty much of a forgotten has-been), Liam and Mickey could have switched parts to greater benefit (Rourke would have been effective in the supporting role of Docherty, but just can\\'t carry this movie along as the lead). Yet another missed opportunity, and yet another film with the potential of being a classic, that became instantly forgettable fare.<br /><br />Ironically enough, the often criticized score (by underrated composer Bill Conti) worked for me. I didn\\'t find it overly-melodramatic, but suitably gritty and beautiful. It reminded me of Howard Shore\\'s score for \"The Silence of the Lambs\". Here\\'s to Mike Hodges\\' talent, who made \"Get Carter\", yes, but don\\'t forget he\\'s the mastermind behind \"Flash Gordon\" as well...<br /><br />It seems the film was massacred in the cutting room (it shows, as some parts are really choppy and confusing, and others just don\\'t glue) and a Director\\'s Cut is waiting to see the light. OK, but I seriously doubt that will make it a great movie, as we\\'ll still have the bad casting and the false premise there. 4/10.',\n"," 'Despite this film having one of the more amazing groups of character actors for support, this is truly an awful film.

In the lame Altman film it stood for \"Oliver Cromwell\" Ogilvie. <br /><br />That is the whole problem with this movie. It should have been out of control fun, but it ends up as a lame reference to social significance. Altman tries to take a tried and true formula of a wacky teen sex comedy (a valid, wonderful and meaningful genre of American Cinema, just like film noir) and violates it by bringing in bad actors, crappy cinematography, and, worst of all, some sort of message of what this aged and senile director thinks is the problems of youth in Reagan era America.<br /><br />At least the previous NL effort, \"Vacation\" they had a good director (NL alumni Harold Ramis) satisfactory actors, and the story was fairly close to the original John Hughes piece. None of the actors here, (save Jon Cryer) are interesting, funny or even remotely close to the few characters brought over from the NL articles (they added other lame characters for no reason, such as OC\\'s grandfather, wasting the talents of Ray Walston). Not even the amazing sounds of King Sunny Ade can save this film (they are only in this film for a five minute cameo).

Those who loved this movie have never read (or had it read to them) the articles of OC & Stiggs that graced the pages of National Lampoon.

The first was his groundbreaking classic \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" released in 1937. The last was the then-under appreciated \"Sleeping Beauty\" which made it\\'s debut in 1959. In between these two was perhaps his most satisfying adaptation of a classic fairy tale: \"Cinderella\" (1950). Of the three films, \"Cinderella\" is the one most faithful to its origins. Ironically, unlike \"Snow White\", which for better or worse, became for many the definitive version of the story. \"Cinderella\" did not follow the same path. Although it was a hit and, like \"Snow White\", was responsible for restoring the dwindling Disney fortunes, it never achieved the same audience recognition which it certainly deserved. Disney, for once, did himself proud, electing not to tamper with a classic, instead elaborating and adding substance to the tale, rather than rewriting it for the screen. The result was enchanting. <br /><br />A combination of superb animation (in beautifully soft Technicolor) and the perfect voice talents brought the story to life with a radiance that endures to this day. Ilene Woods, who was a radio performer, recorded demonstration discs of the songs as a favor to the authors of the material, Al Hoffman, Mack David, and Jerry Livingston. When Disney heard them, he knew he had found his Cinderella. And indeed he had. Woods heartfelt renditions of \"A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes\", \"So This Is Love\" and \"Oh Sing Sweet Nightingale\" are perfect. Eleanor Audley, who would go on to voice Maleficent in \"Sleeping Beauty\", masterfully captured the icy cruelty of the stepmother, while Rhoda Williams and Lucille Bliss were convincingly nasty stepsisters. Luis Van Rooten admirably performed as both the King and the Grand Duke, and James Macdonald was endearing as both Jaq and Gus, Cinderella\\'s devoted mice. William Phipps has little dialog as the prince (future talk show host Mike Douglas provided his singing voice) but film (and Disney) veteran, Verna Felton was born to play the fairy godmother, and she made the best number, (the Oscar-nominated \"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo\") her own show-stopper. <br /><br />Among the artists responsible for the \"look\" of the film, was Mary Blair, whose inspired use of color was greatly admired by Disney. Her elegant French-period backgrounds add tremendously to the quality of the movie. But, most important of all\\' are the believable characters--from Cinderella, right down to Lucifer, the stepmother\\'s deliciously evil cat. They bring both life and vibrancy to the often told story, something very difficult to create in an animated film.<br /><br />In conjunction with the film\\'s 55-year anniversary, (and, not so coincidentally, the coming holiday season) \"Cinderella\" has just been released on a special edition DVD. It simply has never looked better. The fully restored film must be seen to be appreciated--suffice it to say, it looks wonderful. An enhanced stereo soundtrack has been added, and serves the music well. The DVD extras, now a standard part of Disney Platinum Editions, are too numerous to list here, but as usual, some are directed towards children, some are slanted to adults, and the rest fall somewhere in between. But real fans will want to get the Deluxe Gift Set, because, along with an actual cell from the film and eight character sketches, it includes a 160-page hardback book, which not only incorporates most of the material found in the book with the 1995 special edition home video release, but much more as well. As usual for Disney, \"Cinderella\" will only be available for a limited time. So, if like me, you are a \"Cinderella\" lover, get it NOW! This edition is truly a \"Dream Come True.\"',\n"," 'At least that is the strong impression I got from the episode I just saw.<br /><br />The episode begins with two men being chased through the forest, with Black \"natives\" chasing them.

True, it\\'s very faithful to the book (even if unavoidably leaving some things out), but that\\'s about its only virtue.<br /><br />Victor Hugo didn\\'t call his story \"Les Misérables\" for no reason. He wanted to point out and denounce misery and its causes and consequences. But nothing of that is in this film version. It seems a lot like a 1950s Hollywood romance movie, a MGM musical, or in the best of cases, something along the lines of The Trapp Family. Everybody looks too healthy, clean and well-fed, and more middle class than poor, and the darkest aspects of the plot have been eliminated (with the result of one of my favorite parts of the story, the fall of Fantine into the lowest levels of humiliation in order to get money for her daughter, being totally absent from the film). I expected the characters to start singing and dancing in any moment!<br /><br />As for the cast, the only one I really liked was Silvia Monfort as Eponine, who gives the character a very welcome mundane feel. Jean Gabin lacks energy as Valjean, with results of making his more active scenes (specially the one when he liberates himself from the chains to save the life of a fellow prisoner, and the one where he frees himself again, this time from Thénardier and his other captors) seem false and almost laughable. Bernard Blier, with his inexpressive face, is a weak Javert, and the fact that this character is criminally underdeveloped doesn\\'t help either. The rest of the cast is adequate enough, with the exception of Fantine, who is just plain awful, and seems right out of Mervyn LeRoy\\'s \"Little Women\". Fantine\\'s role has been reduced to just a cameo, and I have not decided if this is a good or bad thing, because the interpretation of the character couldn\\'t be more wrong. There is also too much use of an unnecessary voiceover narration that hurts more than enhances the story.<br /><br />Overall, it all lacks Hugo\\'s main point, and, despite the almost textual faithfulness to the book, I\\'d have preferred that it had changed more of the plot but had staid truer to the central theme, than this, the other way around.<br /><br />I can\\'t rate this film higher than 4/10. For a masterful adaptation that truly does the book justice, check the brilliant Robert Hossein version starring Lino Ventura as Valjean.',\n"," 'This turned out to be a very good movie. The story is intriguing, and I wonder if it must have been based on reality, somewhat. The only problem is there was the big film- \"The Devil\\'s Advocate\" with Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino- (totally different plot though) so it may confuse the viewer, thinking these are similar films, and thus, not tuning in.<br /><br />That aside, Ken Olin is excellent in this film, as the defense attorney who must defend basketball star, Joe Campbell (portrayed by Holt McCallany). I have seen McCallany in one or two smaller films, and he was excellent in this. The case which Olin prepares so well, and wins turns out to be a possible mistake. What if the defendant really did rape these girls? What kind of person is he? What is he capable of?.<br /><br />Mariska Hargitay is also good as Olin\\'s assistant. There is a small role for Deanna Milligan (\"Intensity\" 1997) and Gina Philips is Olin\\'s daughter, who becomes involved with Joe Campbell (McCallany).

First of all, the story is so badly recycled as to make it almost unbearable. Second, the setting, acting and story are not very authentic or believable. Third, there are a lot more good black actors to choose from than these standard picks. How about some originality? Third, there were very few Hip Hop songs played in entirity - if any. None seemd really central. Overall, film was a great disappointment, but the editing style was very interesting and almost made the film worthwhile.',\n"," 'I only half-watched this, it was pretty bad. A group of four high school girls who\\'ve been raped by men team up to kill men, including the movie\\'s narrator. Throughout the movie, a gong appears and is gonged whenever there is going to be a violent scene: the \"gore gong.\" There is also a \"hooter honker,\" which is a pair of bulb-type bicycle horns. This is really stupid, and about the level of humor in the movie.<br /><br />As in Gorman Bechard\\'s other movies, this is set in Waterbury, Connecticut, has Carmine Capobianco in it, has characters talking to the camera, and has at least one scene set in a video store. I don\\'t know if his more recent movies have these features; I\\'m hoping he\\'s gotten better.<br /><br />The title \"Cemetery High\" and the video box cover of women in scanty clothing in a graveyard, one holding a bloody chainsaw, is misleading. I don\\'t recall a scene in a graveyard. I guess it refers more to the fact that high schoolers are killing lots of people.<br /><br />A bumbling mayor, policeman, and coroner try to figure out who the \"scumbusters\" are, although two of them destroy some evidence. Maybe if I was paying more attention I would have known why, if it was incompetence, or if they were covering for the women for some reason.<br /><br />Mainly, it\\'s just boring with lame humor.',\n"," '...and that\\'s a goddamn shame! Please make the sun rise and have it incinerate all copies of Dracula 3000. This must be the WORST vampire-flick of the new millennium so far (I haven\\'t seen REIGN IN DARKNESS yet, but they don\\'t get much worse than this). Don\\'t be fooled be the movie\\'s cool H.R. Gigeresque cover. This is so bad, it\\'s almost hilarious. I can\\'t describe all the emotions this movie conjured. I laughed my ass off, I yelled at the screen, I sat there numb, nodding my head in disbelief,... This film has \\'cheap & cheese\\' written all over it. The best thing of this movie are the opening-credits and the opening-shots which feature more or less okay CGI of two space-ships. But when Casper Van Dien\\'s voice-over comes on, you start smelling something fishy. And, indeed, it all goes downhill rapidly after that.<br /><br />The crew of a salvage-spaceship finds an abandoned vessel, the Demeter, which seems to be heading for earth. They enter it, thus sealing their fate. This movie is, above all things, a shameless low-budget ALIEN-rip-off, mixed with vampires. Right down to the plot-twist were Erika Eleniak\\'s character, Aurora, reveals she\\'s a robot. Coolio goes badly over-the-top as the dope-smoking, bloodsucking 187 (pffff, code from the hood as a name?!?!). Casper Van Dien\\'s character\\'s named Capt. Van Helsing (hahaha!) and he looks like...,er well, Casper Van Dien. Udo Kier as Capt. Varna, former commander of the Demeter, is only shown on a monitor-screen and he really does seem to have trouble reading his lines from an auto-cue (poor Udo, what where you doing in this flick?). And then we have Langley Kirkwood as count Orlock, one of the most pathetic and laughable Dracula\\'s ever to (dis)grace the silver screen. Just look at his outfit. Instead of some cool-looking futuristic black suit or something, he\\'s wearing a cheap old-school Halloween-suit with fringes. You thought Richard Roxburgh was unconvincing as Dracula in VAN HELSING? Then wait until you see Langley\\'s performance!<br /><br />The set-designers went overboard on this one. The interior of the Demeter looks like a cross between an oil-tanker and an old steel-factory, which they decorated with awful lights and colors like green, pink, blue and yellow. The prop-master must have forgotten that this movie takes place in the year 3000, because the characters use guns which look like today\\'s .45 magnums and \"Prof\" uses a non-motorized, non-floating wheelchair. It has to be pushed around in order to move.<br /><br />Aside from one dried-up corpse, a few impalements and one dismemberment there\\'s absolutely no gore. And the vampire-fangs and contact-lenses look fake as hell. Add to that also the most lame, stupid and abrupt ending ever: Humvee and Aurora are the only survivors. Instead of having one final (bloody) showdown with count Orlock, they lock themselves in the control-room. Then Aurora explains that before her program was upgraded and joining narcotics, she used to be a \"Protheus 3.2 PB\", in other words: a pleasure-bot. So she says \"Well then, what are you waiting for\". Humvee answers \"Ain\\'t gotta tell me twice. Come on, girl\", picks her up and... \"BOOOOOOM!!!\" the ship explodes and credits roll. No sex-scene, no Erika flashin\\' her boobies, no bloody climax,... Just one more shot of Udo Kier reading a line on the monitor and it\\'s over.<br /><br />So, this movie is a must-see for every bad-movie-lover, but I must warn them: It gets really painful at times. And everyone claiming that VAN HELSING, UNDERWORLD or even QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is the worst vampire-movie of the new millennium clearly is insane, or just hasn\\'t seen Dracula 3000 yet.',\n"," 'First of all, I think this film quite rightly got the plug it deserved on all of the Broadsheets in the UK. This might be partly due to the involvement of Ken Loach himself but also because it is a rather poignant essay of the one crucial aspect of globalisation \\x96 the richer countries exploiting the availability of the cheap labour available from the poorer countries.<br /><br />This is not the first of its kind to be done, but this film had sympathy, warmth, objectivity and class and a viable plot. The whole film, however, is carried by Kierston Wareing, with no real development of other characters such as her business partner or even her dad, who both could have highlighted the different shades of the argument and perhaps externalised some of the conflicts that we all face when we encounter the by-products of such exploitation. By this, I mean the cheap strawberries in the supermarkets, casual builders, the \"baristas\" working behind the various Coffee chains and basically all of the other unsung victims who go to subsidising every aspect of our material life.<br /><br />The basic kernel of the film does succeed to some extent in showing the different facets of the human character such as sympathy for the individual versus the indifference to the abstracted group; highlighting the similarities in the trials and tribulations of people in both the \\'host\\' and the \\'donor\\' countries; the fact that a lot of people are up for making a quick buck off the suffering of others; and that people exist who will try and be fair to others regardless of their backgrounds.<br /><br />However, the reality might not be so clear cut and easily digestible. Perhaps not all of the immigrant workers are so docile and placid; perhaps not all immigrant workers are so subservient and accepting when the roles are reversed and the female becomes the sexual predator; perhaps not all immigrant workers insist on \"passing on the favour instead of returning it\".<br /><br />While it is a noble effort and some effort has been made to highlight the plight of such immigrants, it is still just a snapshot of a much more knotty problem \\x96 a problem that we are all, to some extent, responsible for.<br /><br />That said, \"Bravo\" to the fantastic Mr. Loach for agreeing to get his \"hands dirty\" with such a current and contentious subject.',\n"," \"this is one of the more poorly made movies I've ever seen. One has to take anything by Truffaut seriously; it's not just some B-movie cranked out by hacks.<br /><br />evidently Truffaut couldn't decide whether he was making a noir or a sentimental chick flick. and neither could Deneuve, whose dozen (?) character flip-flops are simply unbelievable -- not even badly acted; just not acted at all. Among other things, how a woman as beautiful as Deneuve could be a person such as Julie/Marion is simply beyond anyone's ability to suspend disbelief; the role absolutely demands someone not so beautiful. Belmondo's acting also suffers although imho his character is not quite as unbelievable as Deneuve's. The cliché ending (which I won't describe) is unfortunately all too appropriate for this complete mistake.\",\n"," \"<br /><br />this is an action movie that works. i am not a fan of most action movies. you have to believe that the hero is a real person and that he is in real danger... the minute you know a character is getting out okay, the minute the franchise dulls. bruce willis was so perfectly ordinary and so perfectly tough, that this role really worked. only mel gibson really had that quality in the first Lethal Weapon. and not everyone could pull it off (certainly not Sylvester or Arnold). i genuinely believed that john mclane was thinking of these things as he went along. even the ridiculous cliches were pulled off nicely. the wife wasn't a victim, but a clear head. i think the second Die Hard was strong also, but when the wife's character disappeared, a lot of the heart was lost. he was no longer a father and husband like in the first one. he no longer seemed like someone who really wanted to live. but in this one, there's a real sense of pain (as in the bloody feet) and urgency (his wife and kids). 7/10. probably not deserving of the top 250 movies of all time, but great nonetheless.\",\n"," 'This is the MJ Fox film that I like the most. Sadly, it was never released on video here in Australia. The story is funny without degenerating into slapstick, the direction is very good and the casting is terrific.

They steal the show and make the whole experience fun.',\n"," \"One has to be careful whom one tells about watching 12-hour long films. It could become easy for people to assume that this is some kind of regular occurrence - in fact, even in the world of 'arthouse' cinema, such mammoth running times are extremely rare, for obvious reasons. This is one thing that Hollywood and art cinema share in common: the generally accepted running time of 90-120 minutes, with a minority of movies that dare to approach, but rarely exceed, the three-hour mark.<br /><br />For this reason, a film like Out 1 (runtime: 729 minutes) is a challenge for even the most hardened cinephile, and it goes some way in explaining why it has only ever been screened on a handful of occasions and remains extremely hard to find.<br /><br />Originally devised as a TV series by maverick Nouvelle Vague director Jacques Rivette, it raised little interest from the French networks, and wound up being given a brief theatrical run instead (Peter Watkins was forced to do much the same with his brilliant nuclear war pseudo- documentary The War Game, although that had more to do with state censorship than issues with running time). Shown a couple of times in 1971, Out 1 has re-emerged at a handful of Rivette retrospectives over the last two decades, and many who have seen it, including esteemed US critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, have acclaimed it as one of the greatest films of all time.<br /><br />Is it? Well, yes, if you like Rivette. That alone is a big 'if', as Jacques Rivette has never been a commercially successful director. Only two of his films were hits (Celine and Julie Go Boating (1974) and La Belle Noiseuse (1991), both superb), and many remain difficult to find on DVD today (Out 1 only recently became available over the internet after a rare videotape was uploaded). Nevertheless, he is greatly respected within the film community, and with good reason - his playfully surreal narratives, sense of pacing and use of improvisation set him apart as one of cinema's most unique and satisfying film-makers.<br /><br />Out 1 deals with a theme that re-occurs throughout Rivette's work: the nature of acting, particularly in the context of theatre and improvisation. His fascination with acting make Rivette's films a far more collaborative process than many of his contemporaries, as the improvisational aspects allow actors to have a far more active role in determining how the film comes together. Out 1 is roughly divided into four major narratives, gradually intertwining and blurring as the film develops: two consisting of acting troupes, each trying to devise post-modern theatrical adaptations of Aeschylus plays; the other two individual petty thieves (played by Nouvelle Vague icons Jean-Pierre Léaud and Juliet Berto) pursuing eccentric methods of making money; and an overarching plot involving a mysterious Balzac-inspired conspiracy centred around an organisation known as 'the thirteen'.<br /><br />As with any Rivette film featuring a 'conspiracy' narrative, the mysteries and secret organisations are little more than a red herring. As the characters are slowly explored and revealed and their plans and interpersonal connections break down, the film becomes increasingly symbolic of post-1968 ennui and the decline of the ideals of that era. For a film made in 1971, these were remarkably prescient themes; another French director in Jean Eustache would tackle this topic equally satisfyingly in his 1973 masterpiece The Mother and the Whore. But this is not the limit of Out 1's scope. <br /><br />Comprised of eight episodes of roughly 90 minutes each (the beginning of each episode has a brief, abstract black-and-white still montage of the events of the previous chapter), Out 1 is no less watchable than any quality TV series, and may even be better experienced on a one-episode- at-a-time basis. This is not to say that it doesn't remain challenging even when viewed in segments. Like most Rivette films, it uses the first few hours to simply establish the characters before embarking on the plot, of sorts, and some of those early scenes (particularly the sequences depicting the actors' heavily abstracted 'exercises') seem interminably long. These scenes are important, however, not just as an exploration of the improvisational acting methods that play both a literal and a metaphorical role in the film, but as a method of adjusting the viewer to the somewhat languorous pace of the film. Paradoxically, long takes make long films far more tolerable for an audience, and this understanding of pacing has led Rivette, along with more modern directors like Michael Haneke and Béla Tarr, to create films with less commercial running-times that nevertheless retain the capacity to leave viewers enthralled.<br /><br />In a film that is in many ways about acting, the acting is fantastic. Many famous Nouvelle Vague faces appear, including the aforementioned Léaud and Berto, the outstanding Michel Lonsdale and Rivette regular Bulle Ogier. Even another legendary director in Eric Rohmer has a great cameo as a Balzac professor who appears in a pivotal scene. The people and architecture of Paris c. 1971, though, seem to have an equally significant role - the city landscapes, crowd scenes and interested onlookers freeze Out 1 in time, a document of a place at a point in history.<br /><br />After a little more than 720 minutes, the film ends on an impossibly brief, enigmatic note; yet, the exhausting journey that the viewer has taken is so full of possibilities, intricacy and spontaneity, that one would be forgiven for wanting to start all over again from the beginning, or see the next twelve hours in the lives of these characters. For those who have watched many kinds of cinema and think they have seen everything the art form has to offer, Out 1 is a reminder that cinema has the potential to be so many more things and diverge in so many more directions than current conventions allow. For film-makers, film critics and artists of all disciplines, this is something to be cherished.\",\n"," 'Why do they make crap like this?

I love Judd Apatow\\'s work, as producer, writer or director. Knocked Up is one of my favorite comedies and Superbad is up there on the list. Orange County, directed by the director of Cox, was a decent film but wasn\\'t great. But still, it had it\\'s moments and was watchable. Normally, I can base a movies value on the names associated with it and their previous work , in fact that\\'s the main reason I saw this movie. But sadly, it doesn\\'t live up to anything they have been associated with prior (maybe Kicking and Screaming). <br /><br />To start, I\\'ll list the things that are good about the movie: The directing has a certain quality to it. Considering the director\\'s previous work, I guess that makes sense.<br /><br />It\\'s not too far from a shot for shot remake of Walk The Line. Which I count as a good thing because that\\'s what your going for in a spoof/parody.<br /><br />They did a good job with the bio-pic aspect of it, which just means that they can see the humor in the constant ups and downs of a rock star\\'s life.<br /><br />Some, and I mean SOME, of the lines are good. I did chuckle and the Elvis part. <br /><br />Now the bad: The first line of the movie is \"I need Cox\", I a movie were the main character, not just that but the movie, is named Dewey Cox, you can really only use that once. But they do it again and again. <br /><br />The movie fools you into thinking it\\'s a Jim Abrahams/David Zucker spoof (creators of cult comedies like Airplane!, Hot Shots! Top Secret! and Naked Gun) but becomes a Jason Friedberg/Aaron Seltzer spoof (creator of such Oscar worthy masterpieces as Scary Movie, Scary Movie 2, Scary Movie 3, Scary Movie 4, Date Movie, Epic Movie and the upcoming, and sure to be critical success, Meet The Spartans). <br /><br />There\\'s a monkey joke, enough said about that. <br /><br />A poor representation of famous individuals, like Buddy Holly, Elvis, and the Beatles. If Buddy Holly has to tell me that he\\'s Buddy Holly it\\'s a bad movie. Even Jackson Browne, Lyle Lovett and Eddie Vedder are caricature of themselves. Basically the movie goes for the, \"haha they are people pretending to be these people and they are doing it badly!That\\'s funny!\". As I mentioned before, Elvis was the only good one because I could see Elvis doing the \"look out man!\" thing, but even that gets ruined by a line that follows it that is basically \"Only two kinds of people know it(referring to Karate), the Chinese and the King. And I\\'m the King.\" We get it you\\'re Elvis Presley.<br /><br />A monkey joke, it needs repeating, monkey jokes died in middle school.<br /><br />The pacing of the movie interrupt scenes that could be used for character development and story to give you scenes feigning what could be considered important story points. It completely negates the scene prior. Example, Dewey Cox is in a hotel room living it up after his first taste of weed, he is on the phone with his wife. She begins to tell him that she feels a distance. Now normally, a Knocked Up type comedy would use this moment to bring down the fun for a moment. Use it to give us a real insight into the relationship of the characters, thus creating a more interesting level to any involvement later on. An Airplane type comedy would use this moment to do constant sight gags, or create a fake sense of pain increasing any sort of visual of audible humor later on. But instead it goes a complete different route when there\\'s a knock the door. He hangs up and there is no development of his relationship with his wife or any really funny sight gags or quick quips. Instead we are treated to a story from Dewey\\'s dad about how Dewey\\'s music inadvertently killed his mom. Oh dear, his mom is dead due to his music. How plausible. That\\'s not funny, that\\'s Epic Movie. I shouldn\\'t have expected more from a movie that has a little kid being chopped in half and still talking, with his legs just standing there. The whole thing leaves me confused as to what this movie wants me to find humorous.<br /><br />I fail to see the humor in this movie, an occasional chuckle and smirk does not make this movie worthy of viewing. It could have been a lot better. Less irony and more funny. Airplane!, Naked Gun, Top Secret!, that\\'s how this movie should have been. An Abrahams/Zucker-type movie making fun of bio-pics done by Apatow and Kasdan, that would be magic. But instead we are treated to a movie that suffers from schizophrenia, it\\'s backed the names behind good comedies like Orange County and Knocked Up, It\\'s titled like a Will Ferrel \"Insert title: the story of insert guy\\'s name\" movie with none of the humor, it has the premise of an Abrahams/Zucker film, but is written like a Friedberg/Seltzer. The whole comes off as messy and leaving you feeling unfulfilled. Save your money and rent Apatow\\'s back catalog and hope and pray that the train of suck that left Dewey Cox will derail and Apatow will be cool again.

The depressive story of love and prejudice discloses a tough criticism to a very unfair, corrupt and hostile society, where losers do not have the chance to recover their dignity and common people are corrupt.

Henry Fonda and Sylvia Sidney show a great chemistry in good performances in this minor movie of this great director. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): \"Vive-se Uma Só Vez\" (\"You Only Live Once\")',\n"," 'A blockbuster at the time of it\\'s original release (it was the second-highest grossing film of 1976), the third screen version of A STAR IS BORN has always divided critics and fans alike. The film open to scathingly negative reviews, however, $5.6 million-budgeted picture went on to gross over $150 million at the box office and won an Academy Award and five Golden Globes. It\\'s not without some irony that Streisand\\'s most commercially successful film would also remain her most controversial. For every ten fans who state that STAR is Streisand\\'s best film, there are always ten more who claim it is the weakest film in her filmography. Although both sides have some merit to support their claims, it should still be noted that the seventies take on A STAR IS BORN remains one of the most touching and highly entertaining showbiz dramas that Hollywood ever produced. For my money, it\\'s the best version of the often-told tale.<br /><br />The film is solidly enjoyable and throughly absorbing. Changing the setting from the old Hollywood studio system to the competitive world of the music industry was actually a great idea, and the screenplay forges a realistic contrast between the characters\\' romance and their careers. This is the main area that the 1976 version of A STAR IS BORN actually surpasses it\\'s classic predecessors. For example, the film is especially successful when depicting the clashing personal and professional difficulties during recording sessions and the never-ending phone calls that interrupt Kristofferson\\'s songwriting attempts. This version of the story is also more believable in it\\'s portrayal of the lead characters. For example, the female leads in the two previous versions were so virtuous and self-sacrificing that they came off as saints. On the other hand, Esther, the female lead in this version, is not only portrayed as being strong and passionate, but also flawed and conflicted. This makes her feel more \"real\" than the Janet Gaynor or Judy Garland characters felt in the previous films, and makes the story that much more effective.<br /><br />The performances are all on target, even if some of the supporting characters aren\\'t fleshed out enough. If you\\'re looking for an actress/singer who can walk the fine line between tough and vulnerable without making herself seem like a script contrivance, Streisand is definitely the girl you want. She\\'s one of the few film stars who can make even the most banal dialogue seem fresh and natural, and, as usual, she manages to make a strong emotional connection with the viewer. Simply put, her Esther is a fully-realized, three-dimensional human being. Kris Kristofferson may not get much respect now for his laid-back characterization, however, he\\'s always interesting watch and displays a magnetic charisma here that he seldom displayed elsewhere in his career. Kristofferson actually received rave reviews at the time from NEWSWEEK, TIME, and even the NEW YORKER\\'s usually vicious Pauline Kael. Gary Busey and Paul Mazursky also give believable performances, but both have a fairly minimal amount of screen time.<br /><br />The film\\'s soundtrack recording was also a massive success, hitting the #1 on Billboard\\'s Hot 200 and selling over four million copies in the US alone. The Streisand-composed \"Evergreen\" (with lyrics from Paul Williams) is unarguably one of the most gorgeous songs in contemporary pop, brought to even-further life by an absolutely incomparable vocal performance from Streisand. The rest of the film\\'s original songs (mostly composed by Williams and Rupert Holmes) are pretty good as well, and Streisand sounds fantastic - her live solo numbers remain in the memory long after the rest of the movie has faded. Streisand\\'s vibrant performances bring \"Woman In The Moon\" and \"With One More Look At You\" to thrilling life, and make even sillier numbers like \"Queen Bee\" work far better than they have the right to. Kristofferson\\'s solo numbers sound somewhat tuneless, however, that may have been intentional since he is playing a singer in decline.<br /><br />Though naturally dated in some respects (it definitely does reflect the decade in which it was made), the seventies take on A STAR IS BORN still holds up remarkably well. The film is well-mounted and slickly produced, the chemistry between the leads is extremely powerful and always feels genuine, and Streisand has two emotional scenes near the finale that are both aching effective. In conclusion, A STAR IS BORN is not only entertaining and moving, but it also transcends all criticism.',\n"," ...]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":15}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dataset = list(map(lambda x: TextGenerator.preprocess_text(text_=x), dataset))"],"metadata":{"id":"1zNstTKKwSbB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1723470259405,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":59932,"user":{"displayName":"Seung Hoon Lee","userId":"06197787624635186839"}}},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dataset"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"YUTMw9GoxJ7Y","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1723470259405,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":210,"user":{"displayName":"Seung Hoon Lee","userId":"06197787624635186839"}},"outputId":"5aef96e7-cec3-4609-f413-7e8c05c701a6"},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['start with the script. i have seen cartoons with more depth than \"envy\". anytime characters keep repeating what you have already seen, and was not funny the first time, a movie is in deep trouble, which \"envy\" certainly is. a movie that relies on one joke had better have somewhere to go with it. here we have a film that goes absolutely nowhere. christopher walken especially would like to forget this bomb, because his character is so weak. ben stiller has been in some pretty good black comedies, \"flirting with disaster\", and \"duplex\", immediately come to mind. be certain that \"envy\" is not a black comedy. there are no double meanings, just total nonsense. \"envy\" deserves it\\'s low rating, because like it\\'s subject matter, it stinks. - merk',\n"," 'john carpenter did amazing things with little money and a lot of imagination. \"escape from new york\" crosses almost as many genres as \"dawn of the dead\". it\\'s an odyssey, a comic book, a western (in the east), a black comedy, an operatic nightmare, a sci-fi cautionary tale, an \"audience movie\"... it\\'s a showcase for underutilized talent. utterly creepy, funny, bleak and suspenseful with rich characters, memorable dialog and stimulating visuals. oh, and that wonderful cast! that wonderful score! this gem will never truly get the praise that it deserves. also, are there any doubts as to where james cameron got the inspiration for his \"tech-noir\" look for \"the terminator\"? sure, we all know jim worked on this movie, as we know from whence carpenter drew many of his inspirations. but there\\'s nothing wrong with giving credit where it\\'s due. notable standouts: harry dean stanton\\'s delivery of the greeting, \"gentlemen. mr. president.\", as he walks into a room of the duke\\'s filthy, thrift-store attired goons and the camera pans over to the president adorned with a blonde wig. frank doubleday as romero.

that woody allen got his inspiration for radio days from foreign sources. i think his own childhood, similar to mine a half a generation later, was all he needed and for any further influence, he must have listened as i did to the radio ramblings of jean shepherd on wor radio back in the day. with the casting of young seth green as the protagonist and childhood allen this was the start of a whole series of quirky roles he's played right up to this day. allen has a good eye for detail and places that have not changed too much since he was a child. the only difference is that he used the rockaways instead of brooklyn because the appearance is still the same or at least in 1987 it was. one thing that certainly had not changed was the elephant house at the prospect park zoo where young seth green and his parents michael tucker and julie kavner meet one of the quiz kids and his parents. an all together unsatisfactory experience all around. the film does not have any plot so to speak, it's simply a collection of stories from just before world war ii and american entry into world war ii. it was the height of american radio entertainment where all you needed was imagination. radio as we see influenced young green/allen in direct and subtle ways as well. television first became commercially popular in 1947 the year i made my earthly debut. but allen's childhood was influenced by radio. you could believe anything if the actors were good enough. young mr. green believed that wallace shawn was a superhero because of the radio. the technique of the film is like jean shepherd's the christmas story and his monologues on wor were exactly like radio days, just a collection of loose ramblings about the things that shepherd remembered from his childhood in the midwest of hammond, indiana. only the jewish humor of woody allen makes it distinct from a jean shepherd radio show being made into a film. woody cast his film well, but my absolute favorite was dianne weist as his lovelorn aunt bea, destined to be a spinster like another aunt bea from television. the poor woman was in love with love and constantly dating a real collection of losers that never quite cut the mustard. if you are a fan of jean shepherd's nostalgic humor and the christmas story, you will love radio days. you do not have to be jewish, honestly.\",\n"," 'poorly-made \"blaxploitation\"

little sister a junkie. violent nonsense plods along doggedly, with canned energy and excitement; only grier\\'s flaring temper gives the narrative a jolt (she\\'s not much of an actress here, but she connects with the audience in a primal way). not much different from what charles bronson was doing at this time, the film was marketed and advertised as crass exploitation yet still managed to find a

kind of death wish to sit through doris wishman\\'s \"a night to dismember\"... very rarely have i used the term \"unwatchable\" and meant it, but in this case it\\'s absolutely true. where to begin? wishman seems to have wanted to cook up some convoluted slasher-horror movie about insane girl released back into the care of her family only for mysterious killings to begin again. but what she ended up presenting was a muddled mess of catastrophic proportions, even by her standards. apparently much of the footage shot was lost in a fire, so when the film was edited, large chunks were missing and lots of out-takes had to be substituted. well, it sure does show. watching the movie proves to be a fractured, almost hallucinatory experience. not a single shot has any location-sourced or ambient sound, all the soundtrack is made up of music, over-dubbed dialogue/narration, and slapped on sound effects. it\\'s like watching a silent movie that has been given a hasty \"make-do\" soundtrack by someone else. in fact it\\'s like watching a film with the sound off, in a room full of improv actors who are making up the lines as they go along, and bashing pots together to try and make matching sounds to go with the on-screen action. then again, very few of the lines are actually spoken by the characters. a narration goes on for the entire length of the movie, explaining everything that is happening however due to the incoherent nature of the film it\\'s the only way of understanding what\\'s happening! and the music! oh dear... every type of stock music is laid on with a trowel, from lounge jazz to rock to gothic chimes, and none of it ever matches the mood of the on screen action. maybe wishman just threw whatever she had handy onto the turntable. and if this was not bad enough, the film jumps, cuts, jumps ,and jumps again, in fact every few minutes there is an abrupt change of music or lines of dialogue are abruptly cut off. and i do mean every few minutes. actually there are a few scenes when the music switches styles every 2 or 3 seconds. there\\'s all the usual wishman madness such as shots of feet, hideous interior décor, backs of people\\'s heads, someone moving position and the camera not realising they are not even in shot any more, etc, etc. in a new level of excitement, we get close ups of people lifting slices of cheese off a dinner plate. some scenes look as though they were shot twice or even three times and all the shots are included in the film, so its like some horrible demonic rewind button that forces you to see everything multiple times. oh and before i forget to mention it, about 30-40 percent of the movie is out of focus. ok ok, i know there are some doris wishman fans out there who find this all part of her peculiar charm. the only other movies i have seen by her are the two chesty morgan films, and both of these are hilarious and highly recommended to any bad cinema junkie. so i do see the appeal of her unique style. but watching \"a night to dismember\" was nothing more than a trial. by the time i had reached the 15 minute mark i had had more than i could stand, but by some sheer force of will i managed to sit

walter huston, as the district attorney, elevates the cliché-riddled material in his futile attempts to breathe some levelheadedness into these dolts. the film deserves credit for being an early entry

disregard for nicky was totally frustrating to me. over and over he tried to do the right thing, and even tried to stand up for himself but everyone in the entire movie just walked all over him. nothing could go right, and the movie continued without any redemption for all of the bad things that were happening, leaving me completely frustrated and unsatisfied. tacy acts like a child throughout the entire movie, as perhaps only lucille ball can do (even that name seems like a child\\'s nickname for \"tracy\" after they could not pronounce the \"r\"). the tantrum she throws at the

for them and explaining how many amazing ways they\\'ll use it and how this specific g.i. joe with kung fu hitting action will be able to help her chop vegetables if they put a knife in it\\'s hand. she rationalizes it in so many ways that seem artificial, and nicky, as he does throughout the movie, gives in and listens to her, though he knows it\\'s a bad idea. she is thus spoiled by her poor husband, trying to be nice and give her what she wants while knowing that things he gives into will be bad in the end. even when he puts his foot down, like a mischievous child she circumvents and tricks him, which inevitably turns out badly because the thing he was standing for indeed held disastrous consequences. much like so many comedies we can see the set up that will lead to some sort of disaster and/or pratfall, except that in this film i did not feel like the punchline was funny. any time the irony came to light of how tacy had screwed up and caused harm to nicky, it was not like some silly prank, but more of a blow to his manhood and the destruction and ungrateful treatment of something he had done to try to make her happy. the ending did not satisfy me after being tortured for an hour and a half by destruction, ungratefulness, deception, and bad luck. i think the movie was supposed to be cute and funny (one awkward duet does not a cute film make), but the conflict

standards because it\\'s full of ambiguities and the kinds of equivocations that japanese culture readily embraces, and is not beholden to the black-hat/ white-hat moral constraints u.s. kids\\' films

avuncular kirin herald--does what many a stressed-out japanese adult would do. hint: this would not happen in a disney film. this picture also has the best product placement for beer you will ever see in a kids\\' movie. early on, there\\'s a moment where a school teacher smacks a couple of bullies on the head with her attendance book. there was a tv commercial in japan a couple years before this

someone gives him a candy bar and he cheers up and sings a happy tune, but his mother comes in and tells him to shut up again and gives him a dope slap that leaves a dent in his forehead. i mention this commercial, because it was considered funny, and i did not hear any objections to it while i was there. there is a lot more bloodshed and physical cruelty on screen in \"the great yokai war\" than one would find in a disney movie. as a parent, if this were a u.s. film, i would be up in arms about such things, although not necessarily the moral lessons drawn at the end of the picture, which, of course, are also not black and white. since it\\'s a japanese movie, i accept that those cultural norms allow for imagery that would not get past the standards and practices cops in a u.s.

degeneres, who makes this film watchable -- if not really believable herself as she's cast as a bit of a heterosexual sex hound. but endearing nonetheless. actually, degeneres and the skin shots of the young guy capshaw dallies with together make this watchable. but no one can really tell if capshaw is really in love with the young guy or not; neither the script nor her acting pull it together for us and we are left to wonder how she really feels.\",\n"," \"wing commander was one of the first real interactive movies when the third installment was released in 94, it pushed the boundaries for graphics, acting and storyline into uncharted heights for a video game. critics argued that the game was just a movie in disguise, now 5 years later the movie is finally here. i had fairly high expectations for this movie, since chris roberts the creator of the original game series, spearheaded the project. the storyline of the games could have easily been adapted to fit a full length movie, but instead they opted to change almost everything. the acting is not great, although it's not downright awful - it's close. the characters are very stale, making it hard for viewers to relate to them. a central character could be killed off and you would not really care, the emotional flow from the screen to the viewer is virtually nonexistent. as almost every one else has pointed out, the ships! they look like wwii fighters, and the carrier looks like a submarine - what's up with that ? i can only think of one positive thing in this movie: the state of the ships, no chrome and gloss, they looked beat up and worn out, kind of like the millennium falcon in star wars... but that's it. wing commander stands as one of the few epic computer games. as a movie on the other hand, it's not worth remembering.\",\n"," \"totally forgettable. specially because of the weak acting. this is the first movie i have seen with dax shepard. to my surprise, he's been around since the late 90's. i thought he was a newcomer, since his acting was so bland. i could say the same about liv tyler. although i have seen her do well in other movies, she gave clare cooper a strange personality. liv is not the kind of actress that will give the character a fiery, emotional personality like diane keaton would be able to, but it was pretty strange to see her say her lines in whisper mode. it seemed that altogether there simply was not a very good chemistry going on between the actors, and i think diane keaton sensed that as well. she's a fantastic actress, but seemed just a bit over the top in this movie. it felt like she just wanted to get this movie over as soon as possible. i would not blame her.\",\n"," 'because of a relentless linearity in the plot, it would be impossible to comment on \"plata quemada\" without creating spoilers. viewers need to realize that fact at the beginning before reading this or indeed any review. what one has here is classic tragedy played against the background of an inherently tragic reality. although most reviewers tend to cite analogous story lines from films like \"bonnie and clyde,\" \"scarface,\" or any one of several films based on the leopold-loeb case, that line of thinking leaves one with less than meets the eye. we know from the start where this thing is going, so one may fairly discard any pretension of suspense and concentrate instead on character portrayal and other broad strokes of the cinematic artist\\'s brush. this is, in short, a brilliant film whether or not it \"goes\" anywhere or stumbles on the way. the acting and direction are at worst very respectable, the editing competent, and the visuals and soundtrack really take the breath away. but the centerpiece of it all is how a time and place are captured as representative of decadent society, and how the redemptive power of love can infuse human existence even within such a violent milieu. cry for argentina, indeed! the tragedy of nene and angel is all the more poignant in that their attempt to flee comes at a time just prior to the imploding of that sad country. their ascent into self-realization contrasts boldly with the broader descent of social and political institutions that had failed them. it is easy to quibble that their own characters are flawed; such flaws are, however, the very essence of their humanity. even the otherwise despicable cuervo is ultimately revealed as worthy of that simple recognition. in short, it is no wonder that los mellizos are legend. whether the film lives up to its claim of being fundamentally a true story is really beside the point. score 10 of 10.',\n"," '**warning - spoilers ahead** short version: this movie sucks. long version: as somebody else wrote, the hole is in the plot line. or better, there are lots of holes, but mainly: a) martin has a perfect alibi, yet he\\'s the suspect from the beginning and nobody believes him. but, since they find him (dead) with the key, he must be guilty. and liz must surely be rather strong, if she can plunge him in the river so easily. and rather quick, to put the key in his pocket without anybody (in the audience) noticing. martin dies only a few yards away from liz\\'s house, but no one seems to care about that. b) hello? did anybody tell the psychologist there were three dead bodies in the cell, one of which with his head crushed? how come the police acts as if nothing happened and no one ever talks about it? how come liz was never questioned seriously about these deaths? the first version of the story ends with everybody coming out of the hole happy and smiling, but the psychologist seems to believe it. c) the hole is abandoned since ww ii, but there still is electricity. the hole has an emergency exit which can be locked from outside, in order to make it completely unuseful. the door of the hole has a glass part, but nobody tries to break it. d)the door key magically appeared in martin\\'s pockets some time before, because he will not let us know who gave it to him, and if we knew it, that would mean that someone else knew about the existence of the hole, and that would have made it too complex for the writers. e) nobody in the school noticed that the boys did not go to wales, and their families did not notice they did not come home. it took at least three days to understand that there was something wrong. f) liz is so convincing when she talks, that everybody instantly believes her: see the ending. g) think about this: when liz came out, the door was open. if martin was on holiday, who the hell could open it without a key? i think that\\'s enough to explain why the movie does not work. a thriller is a dangerous game: if you want to play it with the audience, you must be sure you can handle it. as many famous screenwriters said, you have got to take the story and shake its foundations: if it \"survives\", you have probably got a good movie coming on. this one crumbles quite miserably.',\n"," 'silly,

good original pumpkinhead (1989) or a stand alone horror film in it's own right. the script by constantine & ivan chachornia along with 'additional material' by an uncredited will huston is rubbish,

front of other people & in the middle of the daytime? i must admit those questions kept bothering me right throughout the rest of the film & annoyingly they were never answered... the rest of this silly film is not much better as why would a group of friends suddenly decide it would be 'fun' to dig a dead body up & perform a magical ritual intended to bring it back to life? why? does that sound like fun to you? when was the last time you said to yourself 'i am bored so i am going to dig a dead body up & try to bring it back to life'? people just do not behave like this & yes i accept the 'it's only a film' argument but this was meant to be a serious credible horror film set in reality with 'real' people, do not make me laugh because pumpkinhead ii: blood wings is anything but. the film has an ok pace, there are one or two half decent scenes but the character's & dialogue are poor & overall it's very predictable. director burr ruins what could have been a decent sequel, the special effects are a step down from the original. pumpkinhead himself looks worse than the original, he does not seem to have any colour or texture almost as if he was unfinished & the guy in the rubber monster suit does not help. i though pumpkinhead was poorly shot & did not work. it tries to create some atmosphere but it's all so silly & whats with the constant flashing lights when pumpkinhead appears? there is one hilarious bit when a dead woman comes back to life & she sits up in bed & all these lights suddenly shine on her & she starts speaking in a daft voice to the local sheriff who begins to interrogate her! not a good creative decision, one amongst many i might add. the gore is ok, there are some severed limbs, someone has their head torn off, two lovers are impaled on a fence railing (friday the 13th part 2 (1981) anyone?), someone has their face pecked by chickens & there are some gory gunshot wounds. technically the film is ok but nothing stands out, it's well made apart from some lacklustre unfinished looking creature effects. the cast do not distinguish themselves, did you know that roger clinton who played mayor bubba is in actual fact ex us president

superior original again instead, definitely not recommended. for some bizarre reason this inspired a video game called bloodwings: pumpkinhead's revenge (1995) while two more film sequels have been

for the abduction, or what makes adam a target; all adam really knows is that his every move is watched, and the kidnappers have no regard for their victims. as adam follows the obscure instructions, and the obstacles in his way, the audience can not help but be caught up in his plight. the hand held camera and jumpy editing style enhances the sense of desperation and time. the scenes of urban phillipines, particular the markets and the squatter holdings are a vivid cacophony. co-directors and co-writers neill dela llana and ian gamazon have done an outstanding job of making the most out of limited means. the economy of the film makes it both intimate and discomfiting, as adam is an everyman who only wants his family safe and instead is completely at the whim of an omniscient tormentor.

filmmakers clearly have no idea about ethnic gangs in australia (an irish gang in twenty-first century sydney! the last time any irish gangs were in australia was about a hundred years ago in the time of the tinkers!) but because it's about ethnic rivalry, one of four topics guaranteed to be a success in australian cinema (along with struggling families, minority groups, and the biography of a famous australian) it won multiple academy awards. i have always suspected that australian critics will lap up any rubbish that deals with these issues, but part of me thought, or at least hoped, that they had their limits. this film proves otherwise. so to all you australian aspiring film-makers out there, do not bother putting thought into your film or choosing people who can actually act, or

attract attention, no stars, no backing from the distributor; so, if you look at the gross turnover in movie-halls, the result is a sheer catastrophe. it is a pity, as the film is highly enjoyable - though unusual in many respects: it combines extremely funny scenes with very serious ones; there are practically two settings only: the street at night and the jail; and the cast is limited to seven players: two cameos (wizened richard hamilton, and intriguing norman reedus as the drowned man), two supporting ones (lovely karen sillas and seldom-seen bruce norris as the pair looking unsuccessfully for privacy); and three main roles : reliable william sadler, excellent as the police sergeant; bland-faced promising alessandro nivola as the hero, and strikingly beautiful (and good

seemed not to have a clear idea how to adapt a novel to the screen. they seemed not to know what should be kept in and what might safely be left out. the film opens with sir walter reading from the peerage book that is his primary solace in his troubles. this introduces the family - all of whom we get to know intimately over the next four hours anyway - but serves little other purpose. similarly, the scenes where the musgroves lament \"poor richard\" serve no purpose but to drag the story down. some of austen\\'s actual dialogue is allocated to different characters and some of her narrative is recycled as dialogue that falls awkwardly from the tongues of the characters. there is some fill-in dialogue, too, and this is uniformly dreadful. the scene where charles hayter is boring henrietta with his concerns about getting dr. shirley\\'s curacy was only barely interesting as narrative in the book; as a scene in this production, it is stultifying the scene on the cobb, when louisa falls and is \"taken up lifeless!\", is entirely without urgency, and i wondered whether wentworth\\'s line \"is there nobody to help me?\" might have been directed at the writers, as well as the other actors. this production often looks and feels like a play that has been filmed, rather than an actual film, and this is most evident in the acting, which is the opposite of subtle: booming delivery of lines, exaggerated gestures, and actors who have no idea what to do with their hands, feet, or faces when they are not speaking their lines. charles musgrove stands in his parlour, feet shoulder width apart, and appears to project to the balcony (if there were one) when speaking to the other people in the room with him. louisa musgrove\\'s face, when not actively simpering or giggling, seems to be in confused repose. louisa is a giddy, giggly, ditzy creature, and i did not for a moment believe that wentworth would be interested in her. the costumes are a mixed bunch, but mostly awful, and anne elliot\\'s green tartan gown is quite possibly the most hideous alleged period costume ever devised. we are given the dates at the beginning of the show - it is the late 1790\\'s or perhaps very early 1800s - and yet many of the costumes seem to be of victorian design, and thus about 60 years too early! the hair is just so wrong that i will not even mention it here. except to say that i will not mention it. :-) this production does do some things right, however. mrs. smith is given her proper importance, and her history with mr. elliot, his dissipation and his intrigues, are fully addressed. i was also pleased to see the fleshed out \"reconciliation\" scenes with anne and frederick at the end, which are precious reward for the reader but were glossed over in the 1995 production. if you love the book persuasion, and even vaguely like the 1995 movie, do not waste a moment (or a penny) on this production; you will find it sorely wanting.',\n"," 'i saw heartland when it was first released in 1980 and i have just seen it again. it improves with age. heartland is not just for lovers of \"indie\" films. at a time when most american films are little more than cynical attempts to make money with cgi, pyrotechnics, and/or vulgarity, heartland holds up as a slice of american history. it is also a reminder of how spoiled most of us modern, urbanized americans are. nothing in this film is overstated or stagey. no one declaims any hollywood movie speeches. the actors really inhabit their roles. this really feels like a \"small\" film but really it is bigger than most multizillion-dollar hollywood productions. the film is based on the lives of real people. in 1910, elinore randall (conchata ferrell, who has never done anything better than this), a widow with a 7-year-old daughter jerrine (megan folsom), is living in denver but wants more opportunities. she advertises for a position as housekeeper. the ad is answered by clyde stewart (rip torn, one of our most under-appreciated actors), a scots-born rancher, himself a widower, with a homestead outside of burnt fork, wyoming. elinore accepts the position (seven dollars a week!) and moves up to wyoming with her daughter. she and her daughter move into stewart\\'s tiny house on the property. it is rolling, treeless rangeland, a place of endless vistas where the silence is broken only by the sounds made by these people and their animals. it\\'s guaranteed to make a person feel small. the three characters go for long periods without seeing another human soul. what is worse, stewart turns out to be taciturn to the point of being almost silent. \"i can not talk to the man,\" elinore complains to grandma landauer. \"you\\'d better learn before winter,\" replies grandma. grandma (lilia skala) is one of the only two other characters who are seen more than fleetingly. she came out to wyoming from germany with her husband many years before and runs her ranch alone now that she is also widowed. grandma is their nearest neighbor (and the local midwife) and still she lives ten miles away! the other supporting character is jack the hired hand (barry primus). elinore\\'s routine (and her employer\\'s) is one of endless, backbreaking labor, where there are no modern conveniences and where everything must be made, fixed or done by hand. this is the real meat of the film: watching the ordinary life of these ranchers as they struggle against nature to wrest a living from the land. but despite the constant toil and fatigue, elinore is always looking for other opportunities. she learns that the tract adjacent to stewart\\'s is unclaimed. impulsively, she files a claim on the property (twelve dollars, or almost two weeks\\' pay!), meaning that if she lives on it (and she must actually live there) and works it for ten years, she will get the deed to it. naturally, stewart learns what she has done. with merciless logic, he points out that with no money, no livestock, no credit, and no assets, she has no chance of succeeding. he then offers a solution: he proposes marriage. the stunned elinore realizes that this is the only real alternative, and accepts. we think that stewart\\'s proposal is purely machiavellian--he wants the land and the free labor--but we see that, in fact, he is genuinely fond of elinore, and they grow together as a couple. she becomes pregnant; she goes into labor in the middle of a midwinter blizzard; clyde travels for hours on horseback through the storm the ten miles to grandma\\'s and the ten miles back, only to announce that grandma was not there. this is more like real life than is pleasant, folks. elinore has the baby all by herself, with no help whatsoever. their son is still an infant when he gets sick and dies. they lose half their livestock to the vicious winter. they struggle on. the last sequence in the film is supposed to be optimistic: the birth of a calf. clyde calls elinore urgently to help him deliver the calf. instead of being head first, the calf is in a footling breech presentation. he and elinore must physically pull the calf out of the birth canal. there is no cgi, animatronics, trickery, fakery or special effects: what you see is what happened, folks: a calf is born on a bed of straw in a wooden barn by lamplight. with that, the film does not so much end as simply stop, leaving the viewer unsatisfied, but after a while you appreciate the film as a whole, not just for its ending. this little gem rewards patience and thoughtfulness. it will be watchable long after most of the films of the last generation have long been forgotten.',\n"," 'the only thing in \"sudden death\" that outdoes the amount of non-stop action is the incredible number of plot

world\\'s most blatant understatement! here we have a troubled hero working in the huge pittsburgh indoor ice rink as a fire marshall. on the night of the seventh game of the finals series he gets tickets so he can treat his estranged children to the deciding game, and of course spend a little time with them. also catching the match, but for political reasons, is the vice president of the

plans more than slightly put out. each time a new one of these formula flicks is made it seems that all we get in the way of innovation is nastier bad guys, and more and more spectacular and gruesome ways in which the good guys dispose of them. director hyams and his screenwriter have gone over the top (not that this is an original sin) in trying to make us loathe the wicked terrorists. the horrible baddies go about shooting the secret service, the security and the civilians (both old and young) with gay abandon, and with scant regard for the relative threat of each victim. van damme engages in plenty of fisty-cuffs and gunplay, heroics and death defying stunts. the script asks little of the musclebound european. almost everyone else has walk-ons apart from powers boothe, who

awkward marriage, and the years of their monarchy, culminating with their tragic destiny. shearer\\'s marie is a sympathetic character, a victim of her circumstances. she is not the self-indulgent

politics and intrigue designed to falsely implicate her as an insensitive, distant, and selfish monster. robert morley is perfect in his role as the inept king who ascends to the throne at an early age, and probably lacked the smarts and the intestinal fortitude to perform the duties of a monarch no matter what age he had become king. even though history paints him as inept and weak, the movie

phantasmagorical essence of this fantasy story that has cast me under its spell since childhood. we all know the story of cinderella, a young girl who's father died and was dominated by her wicked stepmother and stepdaughters and longs to go to the ball for one last chance for freedom. but this plot line takes a different twist in the classic fairy tale by causing cinderella (whose real name is zizola, and is only called cinderella by her family because of her slavery) to be trapped in a situation of her father (who still lives) slowly losing himself to a dominant wife who manipulates him into playing favorites with his wife and step-daughters against his own and tries to poison him. thus, zizola goes out to save her father by stopping her stepmother from finding another suitor at the ball by distracting the men who come her way. there, the bored prince valiant has a change of heart from his dull life and falls in love with the mysterious lady in the strange dress (forged by a water nymph named mab) with rose petals for slippers. what drew me to this film most of all was it's original take on the old fairy tale that none can compare to. it does not weave a web of lies like most cinderella stories, it does not ignore any reason as to why cinderella would want to attend the ball and nor does it show a shallow side to the prince as the disney version did. instead it shows more of cinderella's selfless heart more than any other production and the artwork is simply stunning! the costumes are all beautifully made, especially zizola's sapphire blue ballgown to match the marcella plunkett's fantastical beauty and soft, spirit-like voice. i would highly suggest this film for anyone who is interested in a dream-like sequence of the classic fairy tale with an interesting

has been played over and over again, but what made it worse was that the major plot hole was the whole story on how to kill the baddies... the writer could have done so much more with the entire

the film is the visualization of those stories, although from time to time someone must wander away from the fire for some reason or another, and all seem to be meeting with unexpected demises. the stories themselves range from creepy and eerie to somewhat whimsical and silly at times, but all are fairly effective and keep the viewer\\'s interest. no singing and dancing in this film, except with the opening and closing credits; this one is all about keeping the scary atmosphere. there is sort of a \"pretty boy/pretty girl\" cast, but at least they are not smoking joints or swilling beer

the best film ever made. however, this motion picture directly challenges the tolerance that i have for filmed entertainment. \"strategic command\" is easily the worst film i have ever had the misfortune to watch. it is an almost identical clone to the vastly superior \"executive decision\" with elements from \"the rock\" thrown in to try and (in a pathetic attempt if i may add.) to distinguish it from the aforementioned films. although there are some differences in the film (the jet that docks with the 747 in \"strategic command\" is an sr-71 while the jet in \"executive decision\" is an f-117.), these differences are not enough to keep the film from being a mediocre imitation. special effects are mostly poorly executed, although some of the matte shots did seem convincing. parts of the film where some of the bad guys and a good guy vomits looked like they put an alka seltzer tablet in their mouth and would spit the foam out at the right time to emulate vomit. some of the footage of the f-16s, both interior and exterior, were taken directly from the film \"iron eagle\" so as to save money on the limited production budget. acting is another weak point, with people playing their parts too hard. as a result, the characters become unconvincing and lifeless. the only good actor in the film was paul winfield. i was shocked to see how low mr. winfield sunk, his acting talent could have served in better films than this. the film\\'s only saving grace is the musical score, sounding better than most other low budget and even some high budget films. however, it seems that the composer was trying to emulate and, in some parts of the suite, combine the styles jerry goldsmith and james horner. most of the suite, although is surprisingly good for a no-name composer, is mostly unoriginal and uninspired. overall, \"strategic command\" is a mediocre facsimilie of \"executive decision\". this is a film that deserves to stay in a vault and rot away. the video does not deserve to be purchased, even five dollars for this movie is highway robbery! this picture can, at the very best, serve as a rental, but there are better choices at the video store. besides, this film is nothing but two hours of your life that can be spent watching a better film. after seeing this review, your brain should be giving an excellent \"strategic command\" to

involves taking persons suspected of terrorist activities to a foreign country, an opposite to an extradition if you wish, to a place where torture is not a crime but a means to illicit information. instead of staining your soil with blood of potentially innocent parties, you do so on foreign land where such tactics are accepted interrogation techniques. naturally, given the severity of the tactics and attempts at breaking down a person, sometimes you would get what you want once you pass the resistance, or get nothing, or worst of all, get a confession just because the mind has been broken to the point that the subject will agree to whatever you say. it's an ugly process, and what better way to do it when you are the champion human rights, giving the nod to use whatever means necessary in the name of protecting more lives, in an age where information is key to the battle against terror, and doing so in a country where probably the rights record is questionable. rendition is this year's syriana, though in the run up to the new year we do have a number of political thriller contenders to take that crown, with rendition first of all, followed by the robert redford movie lions for lambs, starring tom cruise and meryl streep (again, though now on the other side of the fence), and the kingdom with jamie foxx and jennifer garner, though this one would probably turn out to be more action driven. directed by gavin hood, who did tsotsi and will be helming the new wolverine spin off, rendition is a decent thriller with a top notch cast, in a narrative that has been proved quite popular these days - the split, which provides for some ample differential perspectives to be presented through an ensemble cast. anwar el-ibrahimi (omar metwally), a chemical engineer, gets renditioned en route to going home under the orders of cia top brass corrine whitman (meryl streep). at a detention facility outside the us, jake gyllenhaal's cia analyst douglas freeman (oh so prophetic) embarks on his very first interrogation session, no doubt being thrust into a position that he did not sign up for. back home, a very pregnant reese whitherspoon searches frantically for answers to her husband's disappearance, and sought after an ex-flame alan smith's (peter sarsgaard) assistance, since he's working for senator hawkins (alan arkin). throw in j.k. sinmmons, a terrorist plot investigation and a budding forbidden love story between fatima (zineb oukach) and khalid (moa khouas), you have quite a bit going on in a busy picture. given a number of casts, locations, timelines and the likes, rendition was not confusing at all, and it plays out with deft handling of the material, never quick to judge, presenting ideas and thoughts from both sides of the equation. every character has their own agenda, and the unveiling of this agenda engages enough not to bore nor to confuse you. and the best part of it all is how, very truly, they bow down to self-preservation in different forms, and ultimately, in various lose-lose situations unfortunately. it kept you guessing as well - did he or did not he, and constantly played with your mind as to whether anwar deserved what he's getting. it utilized one extremely smart sleight of hand which i did not see coming until it's too late (so there goes the credit), though it did succumb to the usual stereotyping of terrorist militants, and without spending much time in depth to explore their motivations. perhaps it did not find a need to, given so many movies out there already touching base on this issue (paradise now, day night day night, syriana even). while it turned out to be rather one-dimensional (personal tragedy to strapping of bombs to become a suicide bomber), i felt rendition did right in not providing any saccharine sweet ending, that this fight against negative, destructive ideology, is not something that can be addressed in a two hour movie, and i am glad it steered clear such fairy tale implausibilities. what we have instead is a well crafted tale that sets its gun sights on the issue of rendition, and probably capable enough to spark discussion once the lights come on, on which camp you belong to - do you support inflicting severe pain in interrogation? yes or no? this is the quintessential question of our time. yes or no? (ok, i am already geared for lions for lambs)!\",\n"," 'okay, by now we all know that the whole \"horrorfest 8 films to die for\" thing was a shameless ploy. they tried to get people to pay to see movies that, in their words, were \"too terrifying\" for normal audiences. the sad truth is that they were all mediocre horror films that could not find distribution and were not nearly good enough to release on a wide scale. apparently, some people did go to see them, money was made and the gimmick was fun for the horror fanatics. long live william castle. but that was then. now that they are on dvd, we can all rate and review them for what they are. i have just finished watching one of the eight, dark ride, and i have to say that i am astonished and amazed that this movie received any kind of release but not for the reason you might think. i did not mind the dumb plot, the wretched acting, the stupidity of the characters and the retarded ending. i expect all of those things when watching a movie like this. it\\'s part of the fun. my amazement came from watching this and realizing very quickly that the people who made it have absolutely no idea how to shoot a movie. from a technical standpoint, it\\'s an abomination. if you do not believe me, watch it and try to keep track of how many times shots go out of focus because the cameraman (or the director, who can say) has no idea what he\\'s doing. watch the scene at the gas station and count how many times the camera or the shadow of the camera creeps into the shot. i lost count. at one point, as jamie-lynn\\'s character is wandering through the ride, she falls down... and the camera completely misses it. here\\'s some advice for the director: if you are going to make a movie, hire someone who can pull off the shots you want (by the way, mr. singer, you were not fooling anyone with that awful cut you tried to pull off for the shot of the van\\'s headlight). most low-budget horror movies come off as amateurish but shoddy, careless film-making like this is inexcusable. look, i know that there are things that directors do to save time when shooting a low-budget film. one of them is to set the camera up in one spot and capture all of the action from one angle, zooming in to each actor so you can capture all of the coverage without a bunch of different set-ups. the dorm room scene in the beginning is a prime example of this (notice that we only see one side of the room) and so is the gas station scene (once they had the camera on the dolly, they obviously did not have the time to do another set-up so everything in the parking lot is shot from the left). why would this bother me, you ask? because when a film gets any kind of theatrical release (even if it\\'s only a week) and the distributor (especially a distributor as big as lion\\'s gate) asks people to pay $9.00 to see it, i expect that film to adhere to a certain amount of professionalism. calling this a professional film is like calling adolf hitler a sweetiepie. it just ain\\'t true. just a couple of things on the dvd that i thought were hilarious. if you look on the back of the dvd box, you\\'ll notice that the word \"attraction\" is spelled wrong (talk about inexcusable and amateurish) and just try not to laugh when, in the special features, one of the writers (the one with the man boobs) admits that it took him four months(!) to write the script. oh, and i have been around long enough to realize that most of the \"great\" reviews this movie has received on this site (a classic! a thrill ride! awesome! old-school horror at it(sic) finest!) are all from people involved with the film or friends and family of the filmmakers. guys, that is getting so old. it does not fool anybody anymore.',\n"," 'this

television series ever. i personally do not actually like science fiction movies or series aside from this one show which i give an exception too. futurama is easily leaps and bounds above the rest as it focuses substantially on character development and does avoid the common stereotype of \"a family\" as the focus. instead the focuses of futurama is simply several unique and hilarious work colleagues and there many adventures across the universe. what also is very unique is the characters are all different and each have there own opinions which provide an excellent contrast in the series. another aspect of futurama which surpasses other animation shows is the quality of the visuals. futurama is notorious for having excellent visuals and has won several emmy\\'s for its animation achievement. the positives do not stop there; futurama is amazing at portraying an amazing amount of emotion into the episodes that at some times had my holding back tears. this level of emotion is not even present in the simpson\\'s. one final positive thing worth saying is that the show is able to appeal to all audiences, not just sci-fi lovers. for example by 50-year old mother can not stand sci-fi and she absolutely loves the show. the series itself does however contain some sexual humor that is structured rather uniquely to simply pass over young children\\'s heads. essentially all the sex jokes made will not be understood by the younger viewers. of course the show is not perfect as at it does of course have flaws. but thankfully these flaws are out shined by the brilliance of the series. all i have to say is the biggest mistake in television history was to cancel this show, and put family guy back on instead of this. conversely i am glad there are several more movies coming out which will provide the shows many fans with much more laughs. overall i give the series a 10. one of the two television series i have ever given this too. the other being the simpson\\'s.',\n"," \"watching this again after a gap of many years and remembering the flop it was upon its original release, i am surprised at how well it has held up. one of the reasons for its

aware of and fascinated by the heady mix of fervent enthusiasm for change and a lack of any clear vision for the future. the lead pair are excellent and it is shameful that they took so much flak for the film's perceived failure. they are ideal and convey perfectly the various contradictions and demonstrate a pure delight in lovemaking. i blame others for the over emphasis on the student revolt

by the taliban. not to mention elizabeth taylor at her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic, before she gave in to the gaspy hysterics that marred her later work. all the supporting players round it out, and i do wonder who trained all those elephants. speaking of the stone-buddha sequence, you really can discern that it's vivien leigh in the long shots. her shape and the way she moves is distinct from taylor's. the only thing marring that sequence are the poorly done process shots, where the background moves by much too fast for horses at a walk. if you want a thought-provoking film

emmy for best syndicated program and is certainly an interesting series. it was produced by republic, the studio which did action better than anyone, and they put their best into it. each episode was built around a real historical figure of the old west. a railroad detective named matt clark, similar to the later elliot ness with the gangsters of the 1920\\'s and 30\\'s, managed to become involved with almost every notorious western outlaw between the middle of the 1800\\'s and wwi. the series\\' best asset was jim davis. tall, rugged, ruggedly good looking, in prime shape, with an authentic western accent, and great riding skills which made him utterly convincing in the action scenes, davis was every inch the western hero. he was teamed with two lovely and active co-stars, mary castle as \"frankie\" during the first season, and kristine miller as \"jonesy\" during the second. each worked well with davis. what separated this show from its contemporaries and much of what came later was the professionalism invested in the action scenes. ace action directer william witney directed 30 episodes. franklin adreon the rest. both filmed the action with polish. republic\\'s vast store of stock footage from serials and b\\'s was utilized to give scope. the level of individual episodes rose or fell with the quality of the guest stars brought in to the play the outlaws. among the really good ones were marie windsor as belle starr, lee van cleef as jesse james, fess parker as grat dalton, jean parker as cattle kate, and joe sawyer and slim pickins as butch cassady and \"the smilin\\' kid\". the cream of the western up and comers, pickins, parker, denver pyle, james best, and richard jaeckel, honed their craft. b veterans with decades of experience under their belts, harry woods, glenn strange, kenneth macdonald, earle hodgkins, steve darrell, and chief yowlachie, provided the old leather feel of vintage westerns. the weakness of the concept was that there are only so many famous western outlaws. by the second season the famous figures were becoming a mite obscure for all by the most dedicated history buff. nevertheless, a few of the later shows were a match for any, due to the guest stars. henry brandon portrayed rustler nate champion, and former republic star don barry was outstanding as small-time outlaw milt sharp. western fans or history buffs will want to

great acting, my words of wisdom for you are that you probably have no friends because you were in the movie. you are probably wishing you had all that time back of your life that you wasted on making this movie. there is no way that this is a serious movie. there was an old guy that gets stabbed and it does not even hurt him at all. and when everyone else gets stabbed they drop dead. it was probably important that these people killed random people and ate them and also hung out with an 80 year old man that wanted to put the parts into his body. my favorite part was when the old man found the \"hemoglobens\" or however you spell it because that made the movie seem very intellectual and probably helped to reach the older crowd. what really blew my mind that they decided to throw in that random scene about the college girls going into the woods looking for fake skulls. if you do attempt to see this movie, you should probably fill up your bathtub and drop your hairdryer in it and be

production. actors did their job excellent, three main male characters were superb, female role is a little bit pale and unconvincing to any foreign viewers. rajko grlic did an excellent job with \"stefica cvek-u raljama zivota\", i think he should stick to urban sophisticated stories as stefica was.',\n"," '\"gracie\\'s choice\" is an excellent made for tv movie about the uphill battle of one child to preserve her family, despite social workers, an ex-convict for a mother (well played by anne heche) and a system that offered her little help. at first, one may think this to be the usual run-of-the mill feel good movie; against foster parents, depicting the dysfunctional family in america. not so; it is a hopeful story which kristen bell, (as gracie) must care for her half- brothers and sisters (they are all illegitimate) before she even graduates high school. the story is initially sad, showing heche as an irresponsible, possibly disturbed woman. she has many children, does not know who their fathers are, and manipulates her elderly mother (diane ladd) into supporting all of them- she basically collects welfare support for each child and squanders it. as gracie matures, she sees her mother for what she truly is, and decides she must adopt the younger children. her sister becomes pregnant at 16 to escape the situation, and goes off to live with a different boyfriend. gracie emerges stronger, with the help of social services and her counselor she finds an apartment, a job, and attends school and graduates as well. overall, this is a good film, because it accurately depicts a true story, the reasons kids have children prematurely, and the ultimate responsibility it is of the parent (in this case, negligent anne heche), for the kids turning to out the way they do.',\n"," 'i loved this movie 10 years ago when i was about 16 years old. my biggest mistake was to watch it again, 10 years later. it\\'s not the worst \"i-wanna-be-a-pilot\" movies ever, but it has

although i do not think the film actually measures up to those two films it is well worth the time of most thoughtful fans of the unusual (not necessarily horror). 7 out of 10 seems fair but i must

this which is still unanswered, as it has been for hundreds of years (compare to the streets of new york). the film ages reasonably well, some styles and situations are already dated but it hardly matters. picture quality is generally clean, nice color. sound quality ok but it is a pity the editors could not make an effort to give the music more body. its just a so-so stereo track (the voices do not even seem positioned with aid of the center front speaker) and i presume for something made by cheech in 87 there would have been some good quality masters available and an ability to position

of the abberton brothers, for me the story never really seemed to hit home. this may be because of the negative stigma that often goes hand-in-hand with the bra boys. however, i believe it is much more simple than that: it is a poorly directed and edited film. too often was i distracted by the uneven sound, sub-par camera work and jumpy interview sequences. yet, the film really shines when it is left to people other than the abberton brothers to describe the various incidents through their own retelling. this balances the film nicely, rather than have koby or jai recount their own court cases and possibly omit certain details. another element that enhances this film is the surf footage, which really is the tie that binds all these 'bra boys' together. but i found that the negatives far outweighed the positives for this film. it provides an interesting insight into one of australia's most notoriously tight-knit surf cultures, yet the abberton influence raises questions of bias

version of the virginian has a lot to recommend it, not the least of which is gary cooper in the title role. from the first silent version of the story that cecil b. demille directed until a 2000 made for television film that starred bill pullman as the cowboy who's only known by the state he originally hails from, this is the story that set the standard for the western novel that has come down to this day. owen wister (1860-1938) was a classmate and close friend of theodore roosevelt and when the book came out in 1902 it was dedicated to the new president who was in his second term of office. both wister and roosevelt were easterners who had gone west at critical portions of their lives and made careful note of the mores and customs of the people living there. roosevelt went to the dakota territory and wister was in the new state of wyoming just in time to view the famous johnson county range war. it certainly was a period where certain folks did make up their own version of the law out in wyoming and in this wyoming setting of the virginian as law and order was usually days if not weeks away, lynching lawbreakers was an accepted if not honored practice. and that's what happens in the virginian as gary cooper catches old friend steve played by richard arlen rustling cattle of the box h ranch where he is foreman. it's unfortunate that he did not catch gang leader trampas played by walter huston, but the incident sets the scene for the inevitable western showdown. there was western literature before the virginian, popularized by writers like ned buntline. they were called 'penny dreadfuls' as a commentary of their cost and worth. usually they took real western characters and made up these fantastic unreal stories about them. real western historians in fact are still trying to separate truth from myth about all these people because of these stories. wister was a careful chronicler of what he saw and what he saw set the standard for later writers like zane grey, louis l'amour, luke short, etc. all the western clichés we have grown to expect in films got their start right here. the virginian set the standard in literature and film for a whole genre of

minute battle sequence featuring a cast of thousands inflicting serious damage on each other. and yes, there are decapitations. of course, things do not go as planned, and even superior firepower does not stand up as well as hoped to thousands of soldiers. even before that, the soldiers are falling out with each other into those who want to go home, those who want to go to war and those who want to

but this love is untouchable. the truly kiss of death. and that\\'s how this beautiful modern fairytale starts. when i heard about \"pushing daisies\" for the first time it was promoted as something very familiar (or maybe some kind of tribute) to everything that tim burton has created since \"pee-wee\\'s big adventure\" (1985) to \"big fish\" (2003) and \"charlie and the cholate factory\" (2005). the results could not be better. the world around the pie hole was magnificent. the stories around ned and detective cod (chi mcbride) to solve unsolved crimes can be a lot common in tv, but this is just a way to guide people thru amazing stories surrounding characters as chuck and olive (kristin chenoweth) in a wonderful world full of beautiful and dreamy images that you can almost sense the taste of the colors. not only that, you are merged into a bunch of amazing and charismatic gentle characters, even those ones with the most deep dark humors. forgetting the trivial concept of murders and unsolved crimes, the show brights and is triumphant in a lot of other things. the actors here are top of note. lee pace is tender, soft and contained as the character asks for. anna friel is the muse of the show as her character is supposed to be. but the most superb times are always with the supporting actors as chi mcbride (detective emmerson cod), swoozie kurtz (as lilly charles), ellen greene (as vivian charles) and kristin chenoweth (as olive snook). swoozie kurtz shines performing a so dried character drowned in a impossible dark humor that could frighten a clown, for sure she has the best dialogs and her expressions and body languages are mesmerizing. but if the best dialogs are given by swoozie and her character, the best funny moments are given by kristin chenoweth. seems that she\\'s improvising all the time, she\\'s so naturally fun that every single scene is a show aside. kristin shines so bright in the show that winning the 2009 emmy for her supporting role in the show was totally fair and deserved. also there\\'s the chemistry between actors and their characters, that are also amazing. there are no words to express what this tv show really is and what it was meant to be. for those ones who think this show is a waste of time or claimed to find no sense in it, for sure needs to open their minds and comeback to a time that they probably never had: childhood. truth be told... tv has never been so daring in a tv show as with this amazing one. \"pushing daisies\" was a huge step forward in terms of great artistic entertainment and its sudden death was a lot disrespectful. it\\'s true that tv does not respect great tv shows as those ones bryan fuller created - except \"heroes\" that\\'s still on air and is far from being so amazing as the other ones.',\n"," \"like many, i had high expectations for this film. and like many other reviews i have read here on the imdb, i agree that the cinematography was well done, it was ridiculous to the point of comedy and there were a few moments in the film that almost saved it but bottom line up front, it was a huge disappointment. this movie was probably about everything except the black dahlia murder or elizabeth short. if that's what holds your interest about this movie, read about it in the crime library instead, this movie should have been called boring love triangle story with quirky and shocker parts that almost save it but do not oh yeah and lots of eye candy. the end.\",\n"," 'i have read all the bad reviews about this movie, and i have to agree with most of what has been said. it is true that the film is just plain ugly to look at, and the over-acting is sometimes embarrassing. but perhaps the critics are being a bit unfair by measuring it next to films like \"american history x\" and \"romper stomper\". if you put it next to a highly-produced hollywood film like a.h.x, then sure this one will look sick in comparison. or if you put it next to a truly fantastic piece of cinema like \"romper stomper\", a film that actually played in art house cinemas around the world, it just is not fair. the only thing these films have in common is their subject matter: skinheads. period. pariah lacks the artistic merits of these \"legitimate\" films. but when looked at in the \"trash film\" context, then this one becomes at least entertaining. perhaps watch this one in the same way that you would watch \"toxic avenger\", or \"shaft\", or \"class of 1984\" etc.. of course the way they portray skinheads in this movie is nauseating, offensive, and highly inaccurate. but lets face it; there are so few films made about the punk and skinhead scene, that when something comes along, we just have to see it. anyway, look at the way punks are portrayed in \"class of 1984\". murderous criminals! but like pariah, that flick is good for a laugh. in short, look at this one while you are hanging out and drinking with friends. you have to admit, this trash film does deliver the goods when it comes to violence. it is stomach-turning in some places. and if you want to see a good, thought-provoking film about skinheads, see \"luna park\", the one about the russian skinheads. but do not expect a lot of action there. by the way, remember \"skinheads: second coming of hate\" with chuck conners? now there is a classic. \"pariah\" is almost good compared to that one! a.c.a.b.',\n"," \"sorry, i did not go for this one. for starters, it was wa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-y too slow. the pace was so glacial it was hard to care what was happening. the rats were your basic gang

non-existent. attempts at cuteness and emotions were so forced it was pathetic. and allowing the mouse and child 'toy' to suddenly function whenever a dramatic moment (hah) occurred just killed it. a kids movie not from disney. the producers had a chance to make an impact. but they blew it. for insomniacs only.\",\n"," 'spoilers... \"dry cleaning\", that\\'s what the title of this anne fontaine\\'s effort means in english and it\\'s a well-appropriated one to qualify the contents of the story she tells the audience. its bulk essentially occurs in a dry-cleaner whose purpose is to clean the customers\\' clothes but the director prefers to soil her couple\\'s clear conscience as well as their moral, sexual conventions. could this film be a crossing between claude chabrol\\'s universe and pier paolo pasolini\\'s film \"theorema\" (1968)? it\\'s highly possible and they are respectable credentials for this novel, idiosyncratic film. the first one for the provincial backdrop and a dash of gastronomy. the author of \"le boucher\" (1970) and \"les noces rouges\" (1973) excelled when it came to depict vignettes of provincial life, in the kunstler\\'s shop and apartment but also in the town itself. anne fontaine just has to describe with just a few features, the gloomy aura which reigns in belfort. and the second reference for of course the story of the film which bears a strong resemblance with pasolini\\'s opus: both introduced a young man who subverted a comfortable universe and caused damage in them. \"nettoyage à sec\" could be an updated version of \"theorema\". loïc is the disruptive element in the kunstler\\'s \"petit bourgeois\" world. more than this, he\\'s the catalyst of their buried desires and passions. before making their dreary universe with its constricting etiquette falter in the dry-cleaner\\'s, he will at first indirectly galvanize them to accomplish their desires. the week-end in bâle, unusual in the couple\\' life is a proof of it. before this, one of the key sequences is the one when the four protagonists are together in the hotel room because in this moment, the persona of jean marie and especially nicole is well construed and defined. it\\'s necessary to steer well the evolution and crucial steps of the story. nicole makes love with loïc and it\\'s a sign that she\\'s tired of her life and is ready to go in a new direction. later, fontaine will intersperse her film with conspicuous signs which do not fool anyone. see the scene in the restaurant: she confesses to her husband that she does not feel courageous enough to carry on her nine-to-five life in the dry-cleaner\\'s. she\\'s on the verge of packing in. jean-marie\\'s answer is meaningful: \"however when we started, you wanted to be the first one to help me to settle here...\". so, it seems perfectly logical that later she accepts loïc\\'s advances. as for jean-marie, he appears hesitant and undetermined but maybe would he like (unconsciously or not) change his life in spite of an eloquent sequence: when he takes loïc downstairs to show him concrete memories of his first years spent in the shop. memories to which he is deeply attached... loïc\\'s demeanor is rather elusive and it\\'s hard to decipher his mainspring. is it because he lost his closest human being in the world (marilyn) that he settles to nicole and jean-marie? is he sick of his nomad life despite what he says to the couple? by enticing the couple, does he try to fulfill an affective gap in his life? it was shrewd from fontaine to make opaque his motivations. thus, he keeps all his mystery. it was also clever from the director to have chosen evocative colors for her film and she\\'s got a sense of light. the white of the dry-cleaner\\'s sharply contrasts with the half-murky, dimly light rooms in the apartment, especially when loïc is in these rooms. this to underscore that the life of the couple with loïc\\'s intrusion goes bit by bit unravel. she also has the gift to build her film on a relentless crescendo and to shroud it with an increasingly latent, ominous tension. a tension caused by several factors: disquieting moments or lines pronounced by loïc, by the contrast between the appearance the couple gives to the customers and employees and what lies beneath this when they are in the apartment with loïc, especially when the latter finds himself with nicole. and it will not take long for jean marie to discover their love affair. but also with jean-marie\\'s tantrums he has to try to resist to the strange attraction he feels for loïc. his short wild mood swings are the result of a sexual repression he vainly wants to conceal. loïc will feel it very well in the inevitable sequence in which he will try to sodomize him (a violent one which packs a real wallop). after this scene, one could argue that the couple came back to where they started but in worse: nicole and jean-marie are destroyed. the acting is uniformly good and largely lives up to the demands of the scenario. the type of character of each actor of the quartet complements one another. although the film really put mathilde seigner on the map, it\\'s her coy, brazen partner stanislas mehrer who gets the lion\\'s share. i do not put charles berling and miou-miou in my straitjacket of favorite french actors but here, i was very taken with their acting. \"nettoyage à sec\" has a taut, well-constructed scenario in which every step of the story rings true. it\\'s an unsettling piece of work which leaves indelible stains. it may also walk a fine line with works like \"harry: un ami qui vous veut du bien\" (2000) by dominik moll which could be his little brother. i would like to discover anne fontaine\\'s anterior and subsequent works to her 1997 film.',\n"," 'i thought that the movie was dramatic with heart touching scenes. i would like to see a sequel to this movie. the ending does leave one to wonder what will happen to the invisible

tomme and kachiri and their family. i would like to see tomme teaching his children about the traditions that were passed down to him from his adopted father wanadi.',\n"," \"i am sorry, but i do not

\"casablanca\" is a highlight, as are various send-ups of his own swashbuckling image (the \"jumping\" scene in the kitchen with forrest tucker is a riot). it is tucker, though, who \"tucks\" the movie under his arm, lowers his head and barrels over the goal line. he demonstrates the comic flair more fully developed twenty years later in \"f-troop\" and imparts a liveliness and energy that flynn repeatedly plays off to raise his own performance. eleanor parker does a fine job as the woman being pursued, and little patti brady charms as tucker\\'s actual pen-pal friend. a fine, lightweight \"coming home\" comedy in a genteel setting that children and romantics of all ages should find entertaining.',\n"," 'not sure why this movie seems to have gotten such rave reviews. while watching \"bang\" one night on tv, i found myself bored by the nonsensical, random plot which was occurring on screen. the entire movie seems to be nothing more than an exercise in meaningless,

somewhere in college i watched this film again, and it wound up going (and staying) into my personal best films ever collection. this film is loaded with humor that goes far above and beyond what one would have expected from the muppets. i mean, obviously the muppets always have appealed to adults and children because there\\'s humor geared towards both generations. but come on... janice is accidentally overheard telling someone \"i do not take my clothes off for anyone, even if it is artistic\"... there\\'s a joke from a father to a son that if the son in love with kermit the frog then the father does not want to hear it... gonzo saves a chicken with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (sp?) and afterwards says \"i think we are engaged now\"... these and plenty of other moments in the film had me rolling. add to that very smart dialogue, very smart new york/broadway \"wink wink\" humor, the usual large amount of celebrity cameos and some really enjoyable songs that do not border on \"kid-level cheesy\" whatsoever... this film is a masterpiece! i do not throw \"10\"\\'s out on a regular basis... but this one deserves it. over 20 years later, this film totally holds up, perhaps even more so. the muppets never were and never will be again, as funny and smart and just plain brilliant as this film was and is. --q',\n"," \"this is the second film i have seen of ida lupino as a

government for its brutal and discriminating acts against the palestinians. but, the more important point i could see is that how the atrocities of the occupation turn the palestinian people from ordinary citizens into militants. normal people who, after facing the unimaginable from the occupation forces, decided that the best thing they could do was joining the armed conflict against the occupation. i know many people would argue about how palestinians are terrorists and some such crap, but the point is: who started it all? before you judge someone for carrying out a bombing, you have to first put yourself in his shoes, and picture yourself carrying a 10 year-old bleeding, lifeless girl. one of the things that stuck in my head is something arna said at the beginning: there's no

towards the final outcome. the attention to detail is perfect - the '09' and '61' numberplates on the cars, the news ticker on the bottom of the tv - nothing at all gets missed. billie piper is outstanding as she shows just how good a sidekick rose is, both chloe and her mother play their parts perfectly, and david tennant is brilliant as usual. the idea behind the whole story is genius, and

neurosis. however, i can not imagine that the heavy amount of narcissistic navel-gazing, trite humor, or banal subject matter would be particularly engaging to anyone over 30. another problem is that the peripheral characters, whom the filmmakers obviously have nothing but contempt for, are hyped up to such absurd caricatures for comic effect, that they fail to be relatable in any real way. however, one has to give some style points to the filmmakers, who obviously grew up in the video generation, and use every conceivable editing trick in the book in order to spruce up an otherwise non-existent plot. there are 2 points to remember here. first, beware of festival darlings. second, even though we live in the age of youtube, not everyone's account of their mundane lives deserves big- screen treatment. but these young filmmakers have every right to make their film, and if others 20-somethings can find something in it to identify with, then all the better. yet i could not help but think at the end of this film how this latest generation, just now coming of age, will fare in the real world that presents so many challenges and complications. in the age when every child is

questionably effective, irritating experience that tries to present an intriguing philosophy about the creation of the earth and human nature. it opens with god presented as a chair-bound psychopathic man who tears open his stomach using a knife. from the guts, blood and human waste mother nature emerges. she proceeds to impregnate herself with the dead god\\'s semen. later she gives birth to the son of the earth. a retard who is constantly abused a group of cannibalistic people whom i believe to be the representation of mankind. \"begotten\" takes a twisted and disturbing look on the origin of life. demonstrating the self-destructive nature, violence, lust and greed that have become a trademark for mankind. the problem in the movie come from two points. one is that the film is just too slow in it\\'s exhibition. what we get is a good thirty minutes spent on showing how the son of the earth is constantly shaking naked on the ground while at the same time being molested and tortured by mankind. such tasteless prolonging gets boring pretty fast and lacks the punch in delivering a blow to the viewer\\'s senses. another point is \"beggoten\\'s\" visual appearance and sound. the grainy, inverted, black and white low frame cinematography enchants the disturbing factor of the plot, but such novelties often work in only short periods of time. then gradually begin to lose their effect as the audience becomes accustomed to the look. the audio suffers from the same problems. it\\'s constant repetitive and similar sounds become annoying so fast i had an urge to turn off the volume. \"begotten\" loses it\\'s charm shortly after it begins. it tries to be original and creative but it fails to expand on the ideas hinted by the vague plot instead it repeats the same scene again and again. the conclusion is that \"begotten\" is stuck in one moment. even though plot-wise it tries to move forward, the visuals and audio remain the same throughout. showing the same action

thin plot-essentially on the death of their queen mother two sisters, one evil and one good, fight for control of the throne. the good sister is being beaten so she escapes to earth where she appears

younger sister is helped by bob, a good-hearted dj, and everything is complicated by police involvement and the good sister\\'s ignorance of earth customs and culture. the older sister catches up to her younger sibling several times but the latter manages to escape and go on the run again. throughout all of this action, there is a cult of women on the home planet having some kind of a space age séance to bring the good sister back. sadly a good portion of this film seems to be rather boring car chase scenes as they drive around los angeles (and what was that sound effect when the police car

acted decently but seemed to be taking everything more seriously. all of the police were portrayed as bumbling idiots, presumably to add comic relief, which is a bit unnecessary, given that the whole movie was rather comical. from a ratings perspective, this film had a lot of foul language; some topless women and others scantily clad in thongs, but not enough skin to satisfy those who are looking for nudity; one sex scene that was portrayed in a non-graphic arty dreamlike fashion; and little violence-while there were threats of violence throughout, the scenes of both sword fighting and brawling were exaggerated, and too camp to be \"offensive\", though it looked like the actors were having a lot of fun with it. i have to wonder who came up with the character names? ovule (a small egg), curette (a surgical instrument used for scraping and cleaning), exzema (suspiciously similar to a disease characterized by scaling skin and pruritus), bulemia (an eating disorder with binging

of course, sex in ways that end up with people getting killed. but this is the kind of movie where the acting is so ridiculous (a test of machismo, for example, is illustrated by two guys who battle

lindsey mckeon, who i have watched for the last couple years in her role as \"goody-goody\" mara lewis on the soap-opera guiding light, taking a turn at playing \"the bad girl\" for a change. surprisingly she does quite well, as kristen, a spoiled rich-b*tch who suddenly finds herself dirt-poor, but with a conniving streak, and a twist of fate, that will possibly change her fortunes back around. the twist of fate is provided in the character of richard (robin dunne), a socially-radical outcast who discovers that he has just gone from having nothing to winning $23 million on a lottery ticket. now, put richard, kristen, her jock-boyfriend jason (wade carpenter), and their camcorder-obsessed mutual buddy graham (dave mcgowan) together for the weekend in a remote cabin, cut off from the world by storms, and just guess what unfolds. the film suffers from congesting both the story and characters\\'personas and motives too much. everyone is pretty one-dimensional and it does not take a rocket-scientist to figure out that some things, and some people, are going to go very bad, very quickly. i do not think this is that original a plot and it does not go out of it\\'s way to make itself anything more. the acting is ok, mckeon is spot-on as the manipulative female lead, and dunne is very good, perhaps a little too good at times, but no one else is worth writing home about. the only other real credit i can give the film is the one twist i did not see coming towards the end (not the very end though, that one is so obvious it hurts). regardless, i sat through all of it and

tale about human frailty that would honor the greatest filmmakers and even the bard himself. hoffman of course is excellent. when you do not have marquee, leading man presence, you have to get by on talent, workmanship and pure concentration. ethan hawke, who is no stranger to the sweet, little guy role, adds a layer of desperation and all too human incompetence to the part so that we do not know whether to pity him or trash him. albert finney plays the father of the wayward sons with a kind of steely intensity that belies his age. and marisa tomei, who has magical qualities of sexiness to go

with the tv show `law and order'. we see a fair bit of police work and it is really interesting to see which clues the detectives follow and which ones they do not. the other plot in the movie relates to cassie mayweather's past and incarcerated ex-husband. most viewers found this aspect of the movie unnecessary and slow moving, but i found this to the most intriguing part of the story. `murder by

stupid, so i think they wanted to go back to the story that everyone loved. basically, adam is a little more grown up now and the mom's are going on vacation to leave their husbands with their children. but when wayne's favorite item is threatened for the garbage, he wants to shrink it and keep it, but he and his brother get in the way. but when the wives come back after forgetting to give some meds to their son, they get caught in the machine as well, leaving the kids in the house alone! the plot is silly, but like i said, it was just a family film that i think some might get a kick out of. the original honey, i shrunk the kids is the best, i think everyone could agree. the third one was not so bad, i would recommend this one at least over honey, i blew up the kid movie, it was

hate when people spoil even the smallest details. but, yes, most of the scenes made the 1000 people in the claude debussy theatre absolutely baffled and amazed. when the film was over we applauded for several minutes, we had no other choice. so what\\'s the score with \"you, the living\". hm, andersson is not afraid to take on the heavy questions; history, guilt, gand the holocaust during ww2 are big subjects (and these themes work very well together). the images created are brilliant, the depth sometimes surpasses \"songs from the second floor\". well, sorry for this ranting, praising review.

pretends to be the hero. the kid attacks the bad guy and his mightor mask covers his eyes. whilst he can not see, the real mightor defeats the bad guy. the kid lifts his mask and thinks he did it himself. rinse, repeat, show after show. however. there is an entity that makes \"mightor\" look good: \"moby dick.\" this show is too awful to even discuss. its very existence will depress you like a rainy sunday after the funeral of a close friend. cheap, eye-straining (from the constant blurry underwater effects seemingly achieved by wiggling the lens around while printing the film), and

pretty clever type of shenanigans if you are a ruthless and power-greedy businessman! the two get caught, however, but the girl escapes into the island jungle and finds rescue in the arms of a lone

hideous monster. you\\'ll have to be very patient and tolerant if you want to see a monster or alien or menace of any kind. we are far beyond the 50 minutes mark until there\\'s a bit of gore and at that same moment the director thankfully reminds us that this movie is actually supposed to revolve on a monster of any kind with the discovery of a giant claw. luckily from then and onwards, the pacing remains steadily fast, the atmosphere becomes grimmer, the make- up effects are satisfying and even charles napier\\'s supportive characters which until then was a dull persona becomes sleazier. still, \"alien from the deep\" takes itself far too serious, what with all its environmentalist lessons, and even has a certain aura of pretension hanging around it. there are some nifty

daughter at all? did he maybe kidnap a girl? william keane appears to be a drug addict and a mad man but is he really or is he just a person that needs help? the movie does not gives answers to this

waits for the inevitable tragedy to happen. every situation that keane is confronted with offers a possible mistake to be made, a crime to be committed. kerrigans movie offers a look into the instability of the mind without giving explanations. it shows a hopeless world and a short flickering of a light at the end of the tunnel without being pathetic. it takes the audience from a different angle and leaves no other opportunity than to let us be guided by our feelings, as no reason is visible truth and background are missing. keane does not need to commit any crime; we do that for him in

on screen for all of 10 seconds. the only positive thing i can say about \\'threat\\' is that the animation that is interlaced into the movie is not bad, and the editing is sometimes interesting.

was blown away. like another user commented - this is what i would have liked to see when i first watched \"jurassic park\" - life and death of dinosaurs in their natural habitat as a documentary. the

it could have been\" to make up what then looks like a documentary series. what i missed was some small bar-graph constantly in one corner of the screen, moving between \"fiction\" and \"fact\" along with the narration and the pictures, because you often wonder how much is educated guessing, and how much is pure fantasy. to some clues on facts & fiction, you have to see the 50 minute \"making of\", which is not only very educational about the cg process and collecting and including the paleontologists knowledge into the series, but which also is very funny (dinosaurs smoking cigarettes and complaining about cg animators). i highly recommend to watch this series before going into the upcoming disney dinosaur movie or watching any jurassic park (like) movie again. it will surely make you much more critical towards those movies. the disney trailers looked especially bad.',\n"," \"i went into the straight story expecting a sad/happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting.

the human condition. if you did not notice, watch it again, paying attention to the ages of the people alvin meets, the terrain he's driving through, the reactions people give him, the kinds of discussions he has (one of the first is about pregnancy and children, one of the last is outside of a cemetery). the last road he drives down is particulary haunting in this context, as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount. the last mechanical failure could be seen as a death, and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife, in which he achieves the desired reunion. i only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention.\",\n"," \"i liked this movie much better than schindlers list. to me that

style which looked very irritating and totally lacking in humor. comic timing and wisecracks have to be differentiated from silly mannerisms, and this movie is a big example of that. will smith, is a little more subdued... but is not able to emote much or come up with funny stuff. téa leoni has no role in the movie, she acts in the craziest, most insensible ways, invites trouble each time(if it was real life, she would have been killed the first time she tried to pull off those stupid stunts of hers), not to mention the male leads who too are guilty of this! the wife too is shown as an irrational human being who would make unjustified demands on his apparently busy husband. the movie is about the most irrational and stupid people we are ever going to come across. they do all sorts of crazy and suicidal things at the silliest pretext and dumbest logic! i hope there are no people of such kind anywhere in the universe. about the director, he must realize that a movie can be comic even though it has intelligent people in it, everything does not have to be so dumb. besides, showing african americans in such clichéd roles just tarnishes their image. the only good thing about the movie is the action scenes, and occasional good comedy. so, my advice is, if u have better things to do in life, do not watch it. if u really have to watch a movie, then rent some old favorite rather than go for it. god save you.',\n"," '-and i say that being a person whose hated musicals all his life with a fiery passion -the movie chronicles the events that takes place after the gang sneaks in to see an r rated movie. the movie is based on their favorite canadian tv show \"terrence and phillips: asses of fire.\" the movie contains lots of crude humor and vulgar language, and teaches them how to use the f word and other offensive language in a brand new way. pretty soon all the kids see the movie and start cussing like sailors, and this is where the problem comes from. all the parents lead by kyle\\'s mom decide to protest the movie and the protest soon turns into an all out war between canada and usa. meanwhile kenny dies and ends up in hell and whiles there he discovers that satan and his boyfriend saddam hussein *lol* are plotting to invade earth. and that\\'s the f*cked up plot in a nutshell -the whole movie is told through a series of wonderful songs sang by the characters. from the danny elfmanesque \"blame canada\" to the laugh out loud \"kyle\\'s mom\\'s a *female dog*\" all the songs in the movie are just perfect and fits it like a glove. the humor is the same as that of the tv show, and by that i mean stereotypical racial jokes, fart jokes, gay jokes, pop culture jokes, and sexual jokes. the animation is also the same which must be great news for the studio because by doing that the movie was made very cheaply. trey and matt like always do the voices for about 70% of the characters in the movie, but this time they have some celebrity friends to help them out. i heard that clooney did a voice for the movie but i could not recognize it. the best thing about this movie and also the tv show is of course cartman. he\\'s let loose in this movie and completely uncut so we get to hear him in his whole anti-semitic glory. later on the movie his filthy mouth ends up saving the day. -i love this movie. it\\'s exactly my type of humor, it does not hold anything back and is wonderfully filthy. all the jokes whether racial or homosexual jokes are simply meant as just jokes and nothing more. conservative people who find that kind of humor to be

rainer did a good job with her part. it was not the greatest performance i have ever seen but for old-school pre-method acting it was nice. the locust scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects. i wonder that the timing of the release during the great depression sort of turns this film into an allegory. especially the political upheaval bewildering the peasant farmers and how them seem to be left behind by all of it. the film had some parallels to the john ford style, but i think the eastern influence affected it as well. if this had been an western family, the locusts

on your grave,\" to the tawdry sensationalism of \"lipstick,\" to the tasteful handling of the issue in \"the accused.\" but \"descent,\" though making some important points, never really offers us anything truly new in terms of revelatory meaning. no, \"descent\" is so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that it detracts from any significant message it could hope to make -- a message that, when examined closely, is not that groundbreaking. i pretty much knew the plot going in. what i wanted to see *was* the \"descent\" or degeneration of dawson\\'s character. being a big fan of rosario\\'s, i was anxious to see the layers being stripped away and her psyche being slowly twisted... you know, the kind of portrayal deniro brings to \"taxi driver.\" unfortunately, the script and the director/writer\\'s choices do not provide any sort of believable transition. the biggest point of failure is the second act. it became obvious what the filmmaker\\'s intentions were for this segment of club-hopping, drug use, and obsession with big black stallion adrian (every white boy\\'s nightmare, natch) from a q&a on the dvd, but this excursion into dawson\\'s character is never believably rendered. we do not know exactly what the hell she\\'s doing half the time, what she\\'s after, or why she\\'s doing it. the poor quality of the audio/video again do not help, but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless. it destroys any momentum and investment in the lead character set up during the otherwise exceptionally well-done first act. by the time we get to the finale, our interest has already waned. one point of success that dawson does point out in the q&a is that by the end \"revenge\" scene we are pumped for retribution, then realize just how drawn-out and ugly the reality is. while that\\'s certainly valid, it does not make the scene any more intriguing. if you have the dvd, check out the deleted \"classroom\" scene. this is an excellent 8 minute plus outtake that crackles with energy and provocation (though all verbal) and really does show dawson\\'s slow crack-up materializing as she delightfully vivisects poor francie swift\\'s prissy, condescending dorm counselor. if more expository scenes like this had been added and more of the middle third cut down, we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violence. as the film stands in the final cut, though, all we get is what we have seen before, only in a more graphic rendering. so what?',\n"," 'this film was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. it was sort of a remake but then again, not really. i was very disappointed considering the tools that tim burton has at his disposal. he had great make up and cgi available and lots of money ($100 million) but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was made for less than $6 million? heck no. so in that regard, the film fails. at least in the original film, the statue of liberty scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking in this film even the end scene because you could kind of see it coming. and, by the way, if you give it some thought, and i did, you can figure out how the ending could come about. i just wish i had back the time that i wasted thinking about it. this film would have been brilliant and fun if it stayed along the lines of the first film and adopted part of \"beneath the planet of the apes\". here\\'s how i would have written it: an astronaut (it really should have been more than marky mark because he\\'s not good enough to care a film all by himself so i would have put in three guys) that would land on what they would think would be another planet, encounter humans (not mutes), a city ruled by apes, were hunted, made friends with some good apes, discover that they are on earth via finding some destroyed ruins, end up running into crazy mutant humans living beneath the earth, a war breaks out between the mutant humans and the apes, and then... well, let your imagination run wild on how you want to end it. but my point is that there could have been so much more to this film. sadly, tim burton really knows how to wreck a good thing. consider what he did with the batman series. he\\'s a rotten director inspite what of people think. he\\'s trendy so he must be good goes the thinking.

two different teen novels as a basis for a \"plot\" did not work. the plot was all over the place; my friend (also a seventeen year old female) and i would stare at the screen and whisper, \"what the hell was that?\" every five minutes. this movie had every cliche imaginable: teenage pregnancy, divorce, marriage, birth, death, car accident. if reading that seemed random, try watching it. it\\'s ridiculous. oh, and i neglected to mention the pot smoking grandmother. here are a few examples about what just did not work in this movie: about 10-15 minutes into the film, a boy collapses on the soccer field. he\\'s clutching his stomach, and my friend and i both immediately thought, \"oh, appendicitis.\" next shot (this is after he passes out and people are surrounding him), he\\'s on the ground clutching his chest. dramatic voice-over is something along the lines of him dying of a heart defect. insert my friend and i (and other audience members) saying, \"what the hell?\" another scene. the best friend is pregnant. she and halley (mandy moore) are talking afterwards, and scarlett (the friend) is wearing a tank top with four pictures of the gerber baby. \"what the hell?!\" it goes on and on. honestly, if we\\'d realized 20 minutes into it how disorganized and poorly put together it was going to be, we would have left. the only reason we stuck around the whole time was because we\\'d sat through it for so long that we could not get our $9.25 back if we left. as far as the acting goes, mandy moore was decent, but i did not really get her character. as i have not read the two novels this movie was based on, i do not even know if she was playing two different characters or one. actually, when halley would do a total 180 between scenes, my friend and i joked whether they pulled the scene from novel one or novel two. as for trent ford... i am not going to discuss his looks other than in this statement, because i do not think criticizing an actors appearance does any good. as far as the actual acting went... it was pretty rough. did not do anything for me. a couple of the supporting characters (played by allison janney and alexandra holden) were ok; others (mackenzie astin, mary catherine garrison) were as terrible as trent ford. one can only hope that if mandy moore wishes to be taken seriously as an actress, she\\'ll accept a better script next time,

impressive cast list was not enough to save this disaster (of a) movie from a thoroughly boring and unoriginal script. ** potential spoilers follow - not that there's much to spoil ** the plot is fuller of holes than a swiss cheese. for a start i am not sure that an active volcano and an oil field on the same small island are compatible, but as i am not a geologist i might be inclined to let that go. but there's much more. there's the tidal wave that trashes the village up the coast when the hotel does not see so much as a ripple. correct me if i am wrong but would not a tidal wave travel outwards from an eruption and trash the island next door? there's the long shot of a volcano spewing fire full blast into the stratosphere, cut to the research station on the edge of the crater. ok it does not look to be the best place to be but judging by the previous shot it should be vapourised. there's the overloaded helicopter that crashed, despite having taken of even more heavily loaded (at least 3 people fell off). oh yes, and it had just arrived even more heavily loaded. all it would have taken to make this less ludicrous was an additional four words in the script, (it's out of gas!) but obviously time ran out for the script-writers some time before they had finished the job. and where did that blonde woman get that awful pink dress. the group that left the hotel to reach safety on the other side of the island were told they were travelling through rough country and to wear sensible clothes. i do not believe that was the best she could do. and last but not least, the plot driver for the whole film was the head-in-the-sand attitude of hotel owner. he refused to leave,insisting that the lava could not reach that far, an that the hotel was the safest place to be. quite a few others followed his lead. we never saw the lava reach the hotel. it was destroyed when the volcano blew its top again, shooting out a few tons of fiery rock which arced high in the air and, much against the odds, scored a bullseye. it seems the hotel owner was right, the odds were better on staying, even if they did not come off. all in all, one to miss. but why, you might ask, if it was that

one of those unknown, quintessential diamond-in-the-rough films that can not seem to find its way into the dvd market, but breaths criterion throughout the entire viewing. the daring, honest, and descriptive story of a young boy, his love for this older girl, and the tribulations of growing up in a small town are merely scratching the surface to what this film has to offer. it speaks, and pays homage, to those classic films from the late 40s, early 50s by creating a town with character, mythology, and individuality. one could argue that the town in which this film takes place is our fourth character, behind danny, freya, and trevor but perhaps this enthusiast is getting ahead of himself. watching this import on a used vhs, the picture was grainy, the player made noise, and the sound was utterly destructive yet the heart of this film oozed from the screen. the power of the characters, the detail of our story, and the truth in director/screenwriter john duigan\\'s words went from having meaning in a 1987 film (that was supposed to take place in 1962) to creating a story that did not feel dated or old watching it today, at the end of 2009. that is the legacy of \"the year my voice broke\", the raw emotion harassed in this film continues to be relevant today perhaps even more. as hollywood uses every cgi possible to recreate the same effect, all one needs to do is look back at films that used the old-fashioned method great actors, a daring script, and a background that could knock your socks off. to applaud this film, one would need to pat the back of a very young, a very talented, noah taylor. taking on not just an awkward role, he needed to show his anger, his teenage frustration, as well as his headiness for brains instead of brawn. noah taylor, known to me as technical support in \"vanilla sky\", succeeded gracefully and with the power of most of our top paid american stars. his ability to show us his unconditional love for freya, his quizzical hatred for trevor, as well as his sleuthing skills proved that this kid was ready for anything. his co-workers inhabiting each scene worked with his dynamic and equally pushed their talents. freya, played by loene coleman, a newbie to the screen, was enchanting as the love interest. while she was not quite the level of mr. taylor, her ability to carry her scenes worked. she was the classical bad-girl-next-door with secrets. her chemistry with taylor kept me glued to the screen. the same can be said for trevor, played by ben mendelsohn, who\\'s diabolical, nearly irritating, laugh created a character all his own. as the wildcard, we never knew what he was going to do next, and both our characters and our audience were scared of that. to demonstrate the intensity of these actors, watch closely the scene in which they spend the night in the \"haunted\" house near the railroad tracks. each one has a motive, each actor/character delivers their emotion, and with each line the scene gets more and more powerful. i was not expecting this with children so young. with these three dominate characters; one may ask what else would be needed for an independent film to succeed? one more, the town. as mentioned before, the town that these three (and many others) reside is reminiscent of our american \"bedford falls\". there are residents that have been their all their lives and secrets many of them keep to protect their town. throughout the film, our characters are continually building their moments via smaller lives within the town. we learn about danny\\'s passion for the black arts, that trevor knows the police firsthand, and that freya\\'s unknown secret keeps the town at bay. without the closeness of this town, \"the year my voice broke\" would not have worked. if filmed in a bigger city, the intimate feeling of a protective yet destructive town would have floundered. the town drunk would have been less poignant, danny\\'s dad\\'s role would have felt less personal, and the idea of home being safe would have felt less comforting. the town had to be a character in this film. duigan knew it, developed it, and built it strongly into his film. this was a character driven film. without noah taylor, loene coleman, or ben mendelsohn, this film would have failed. it is hard to imagine anyone else being able to carry these characters, or that an american reality would pack as much of a punch. it was impressive to see australia in 1962, a place we do not explore in cinema enough over past centuries. director duigan, if i have not already drooled over him enough, understood this film, wrote a genuine story, and built a cinematic triumph. alas, this film has been forgotten, but look closely at the cinematography, the lavish landscapes, the devotion of our characters, the above mentioned town these all could not have been accomplished without a passionate eye. i applaud duigan for his talent and ability to transform this 1980s film into a universally emotional and exciting moment of cinema. overall, i have said enough. i loved this movie. it was detailed, emotional, and beautiful. everyone, from director to actors performed superbly. it was a rough couple of prior films, but \"the year my voice broke\" provided that classic niche. it felt fresh and new, despite the age. i recommend this to everyone. buy a vhs player and get a copy of this movie, you will not be disappointed. grade: ** 1/2 out of **',\n"," 'you know, i have never been a big fan of rap culture, but i thought that the film in question, \"stop snitchin\\', stop lying\", while it does have some incredibly stupid and/or unintentionally hilarious parts, actually was enjoyable enough for me to watch all the way through. basically, the film chronicles rapper the game ( i will call him mr. watkins from now on, because that\\'s his real name) as he goes on his \"world tour\" (now that i think about it, i do not think he went anywhere except for norway and the u.s., but what do i know), and tries to find 50 cent, so he can try to get him to explain why he ratted out a member of the group (i think that\\'s what it was). along the way, mr. watkins explains his life story to the audience, gets arrested in north carolina, meets a veritable group of fans from all over the u.s., and tries to dispel the rumors of his breakup with 50 cent and the \"g-unit\" (to which mr. watkins now effectively calls the \"g-unot\"). needless to say, it does get a little dry at times, and there are parts which are funny like you would not believe (atkins making an impassioned plea to 50 cent to help him release irv gotti, the supposed \"re-enactment\" of 50 cent confessing to a police officer, the guy being driven around yelling at some woman who is supposedly a man) and the video quality is very shoddy. however, the one thing i took away from this experience is that mr. watkins genuinely loves his fans. and, bless his soul, he seems to do a lot for them. we see in this film that watkins personally reads fan mail and signs copies of every album sent to him (before sending them back), and that he\\'s not above meeting new faces and friends on the street. i do not think i have ever seen one rap artist do that, and, to be honest, when mr. watkins said he was doing all this for the fans, i believed him. he may get a bad rap because of his narcissistic and childish demeanor, and he may be a very rich person, but he loves his work and the people who respect his work, and personally, i think that\\'s the only thing that matters. bottom line: if you are a fan of the game or of rap music in general, give this one a look. it\\'s a heck of a lot better than that \"get rich or die trying\" film.',\n"," \"i just saw this film at the

this one! michael jayston is a great, truly great rochester; sorcha cusack, with that beautiful round face, those lovely eyes and that velvet voice, is a jane from the other world; and the connection between them is genuine empathy - just like the connection there is between their respective characters. the portrayal of the secondary characters is made in much the same way. the performances of isabelle rosin as adèle, of megs jenkins as mrs. fairfax, of stephanie beecham as blanche ingram, and of geoffrey whitehead as st. john rivers, are all very good and quite close to what can we read in \"jane eyre\". the real marrow of charlotte brontë\\'s novel: this is what one can get from this, the 1973 bbc production of \"jane eyre\". nothing of real importance is missing here - above all, god. the final lines said by sorcha cusack, taken out of the last chapter of novel (sadly missing in all the other tv and movie versions), are a sort of resume of charlotte brontë\\'s faith in god: after helping both jane and rochester going through their ordeals, god blesses her supremely and judges him with mercy; so, there is reason to believe in god. just like the novel, this tv production is a story told by jane\\'s own point of view: it\\'s a \"flash-back\". the use of narration through jane\\'s \"inner-voice\" is as effective here as it is old in the history of english theatre: it harks back to william shakespeare, who used to make his characters turn to the audiences and speak out their intimate thoughts. drama and humor, suspense and surprise are all very finely balanced in this bbc production of \"jane eyre\". as for the humor, i do not mean to be rude to those reviewers whom have written elsewhere criticizing sorcha cusack\\'s performance, but i am afraid they simply do not grasp british humor - particularly, the \"understatement\", which is present in almost every line of many of the intimate dialogs between jane and rochester (both in the novel and in this production). it should be noted that this is neither a \"romantic\" nor a \"gothic\" production of charlotte brontë\\'s novel. in fact, i am not even sure that \"jane eyre\" is a true romantic or a true gothic novel. as far as i remember, it was jorge luis borges who stated that it could be classified as one of the predecessors of the so-called \"magic realism\" in literature. indeed, between \"romanticism\", \"gothicism\" and \"magic realism\", i personally find \"jane eyre\" much closer to the latter... to my mind, in a scale of 1 to 10, the 1973 bbc production of \"jane eyre\" deserves 9.9. it would get a clear 10 out of me if it had (as it should!) at least fifteen episodes; but, since it was a \"low budget\" production, it has only five - and, because of that, the \"gipsy scene\" had to be pruned up to the point of becoming just a hilarious scene, and the character of rosamond oliver had to be simply tossed off. nevertheless, it is the best of all screen versions there are of \"jane eyre\": the most faithful to novel, superbly tight and paced, very well put up together, with first class performances and elgar\\'s introduction and allegro for strings, opus 47 (1904-05), as the musical background. in short, it is a sublime piece of art. do not miss it!...',\n"," 'if you find yourself in need of an escape, something that will hold your attention for two hours and allow you to be lost in another world, domino will satisfy that need. this is entertainment, after all! the plot keeps your brain in motion - one of those movies (like usual suspects) where you want to see it a second time to figure it all out. i wondered about domino harvey herself, how her life became of interest to hollywood. as for the acting, lots of celebrity appearances not shown in the trailers. and any actor that makes me forget who they are has done their job well. not once did i think of kiera in a soccer uniform or pirate costume. and granted, mickey rourke plays mickey rourke well and

the story is great. i absolutely love the storyline. i still think so today. but as for the movie, that's another story. i have read the mangas. i am not exactly a big fan of clamp's work, but this one is the first that i got into with the mangas. i fell in love with one of the characters in the story name subaru sumeragi. favorite character for obvious reason, but if you like any character other than kamui or fuuma, then you are in for the biggest disappointment if you watch this movie. ok, to get to the point, this is basically stuffing all the series of the manga into one movie. you will not have time to get to know the characters if you did not know them already. you just will not get to. well, they at least explain a bit of their purpose in life for a few seconds. also, they failed to explain a lot of things about the movie, so that's another big disappointment. er, and another big disappointment is that, they change some of the character's personality! another big disappointment is that they did not put some of the good story lines in the mangas into the movie. i know that does not seem like a big deal and i would like to give an example. there's this one character who loves another character from the other angel (they are enemies angels), but in the movie, they hate each other. so that's what i mean. but wait, there's a good! the good is that the animation is great. beautiful and artistic like all of clamp's work. it's realistic in animation, and the way it was done was just, wow. even though they lack everything else, but it was still nicely done in animation wise. now if only the series was done the same way. oh yeah, the music is great also. even though i like the story and how it was animated, i just did not want to sit through it anymore. once was enough. so i gave it a 4/10\",\n"," 'the title for this review about sums up how i feel about this movie. i can not imagine what audience there would be for this thing, if not for the die-hard fan of 1980s slasher films who simply has to see -everything- from that era. otherwise, do not even waste your time on this. the story is similar to most films of its type: something awful happens to one of the characters in the opening scene, which inspires a bloodthirsty killer to go on a murderous rampage. been there, done that. truth be told, none of these \\'80s slashers were known for their originality, so i can not see the point in harping on the film simply for this. but where the film fails is in its suspense and murder sequences. i have seen some pretty scary slasher movies from the 1980s that had far lower budgets than this. this one just fails to create any real suspense. the director throws in some nice camera angles and some semi-professional directorial touches here and there, but they mean nothing if you are not frightened. the gore is pretty tame as well, so anyone who watches these things with the intention of seeing some cool 1980s makeup effects will be sadly disappointed. the movie manages to clunk along rather dully. honestly, the key ingredient to almost any slasher is the tight pacing--you have to keep things moving along swiftly and keep the murder set pieces staged at regular intervals, because, let\\'s face it, we do not watch these things for the great characterization and stellar plots. but the pacing, whether due to the script or the editor, is all off. the murders are spaced out at odd intervals, leaving us with some long-winded scenes (no doubt meant to build \"character\") that serve only to bore you and leave you praying for the next kill (which, as i have said, usually is not executed all that well anyway). as for the killer, do not expect anything original or even remotely frightening. he (or she?) wears a jogging suit, a fencing mask, and his (or her?) primary weapon is a sword. i bet the writer just wet himself over thinking he came up with an original, \"cool\" murder weapon, but the idea just comes off as impractical and silly. there\\'s also not much emphasis placed on the \"whodunnit\\' nature of the film, as if they either forgot or do not care to place any red herrings in the mix to throw us off. i have the sense that the people behind this were trying to make something decent and respectable, and at times, it shows their intentions were probably a bit more genuine in regards to making a quality film as opposed to countless other knockoff slashers from the era. but alas, the attempt fails for the most part. there is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film). there is attempt at characterization, but none of it ends up meaning anything in the end, so... what a waste. here, all it manages to do is bog down the plot and make the murder sequences feel like they can not come soon enough. in the end, if you are really into these old \\'80s slashers, by all means, check it out, if only to say you have seen it. there\\'s a completest in all of us. but do not expect to be blown away or anything. what we have here is a very mildly entertaining slasher movie that leaves no real impression at all.',\n"," \"emily watson's natalia is absolutely the most loving and romantic lead character i have ever seen on a screen. she is the queen of this film beyond all doubt. or, is she transmuted to the king? the internecine weaving of the chess games and the families' struggles for control, power, and victory is stunning. just as the chess masters in the film do, the director is playing many simultaneous games with our mind at once, but all weave into either major or minor patterns. the period, the costumes, and imagery of early 20th century italy's lake district is captured magnificently. not a single square of space is wasted. so many brilliant scenes abound, i cannot recount them all. i recommend budgeting enough time to watch this movie twice, possibly a week apart, because you can not possibly capture all the poetry within a 64-square yet multi-dimensional framework in one setting. i did not read nabakov's book, but to try an analogy of my own, what i am reading reminds of me of another romantically triumphant poetry-as-game movie, barry levinson's the natural. it totally jettisoned the downbeat ending of bernard malamud's fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely american. well, the director did that one better by seamlessly meshing russian and italian morals and mores as a backdrop to enlightenment. the true story here is that games are zero-sum; there is a winner and a loser, unless both contestants draw. but, in life, and especially in the context of our immortal souls, we are only limited by those constraints and life's conventions to the extent we let others break our spirit. pure love, as personified by emily watson's natalia, can transcend and allow all of us to be enhanced by its gifts simultaneously. only the barriers erected by our fears can cut us off from it. this is a magnificent movie (10/10).\",\n"," 'yeah, ok, this may be deliberately cheesy but it\\'s all pretty lousy, and not in a good way. we have a brave \"bone hunter\" in search of dinosaur valley but all

accidents, murders, dead kids, and suicides leave their imprint in your mind after you watch it. this particular volume had a lot of race footage and stunt wrecks as well as war and bombing footage. several highlights include the suicide by gunshot to the head of the owner of a company that went under, bullfights, a shark bite victim, sex change operation footage (male and female), plastic

this film and another film to watch this evening, and unfortunately, i chose this one. if i had not previously read some reviews here on this film, i would not have had a clue what was going on, as it was, the film was somewhat confusing. part of the problem was the characters, except for florence, played by mickey rourke, all dressed almost alike. okay, i am not good at telling people apart at best, and when they are all young men, about the same ages, general build, and height and all wearing very similar suits, my ability at identifying them goes waay down. i know that plays into the plot, but it also added to my confusion as a viewer. the film also failed to clarify why the characters were doing what they were doing. first we have the three young men, who are borderline still boys, who are wearing suits and hats and driving one of the lad's father's black cadillac, without permission. beautiful car - as this film was set in the late 1950's, back when cars were cars, if you know what i mean. the boys think it would be great fun to pretend to shoot someone and then stuff him in the trunk and drive off - shocking numerous people who will witness the incident. one of them is to play the part of the man who gets shot. however, their prank goes awry. then we have more confusion. like why does leon (stephen baldwin)hold the two boys captive and torture them? why does not he just drive off in the cadillac and carry on with the planned bank robbery? i never understood that. why the bit with a gangster coming into the bank and pretending he's with the fbi? was that the way florence thought he could get away with the money without being pursued by the police, or what? then we have a totally unbelievable sex scene between one of the boys and a female bank employee, following him kidnapping her and waving a gun at her. yeah, the guy was nice looking, but gee whiz i'd think making out would not exactly be the first thing on their minds given their tense situation, and the fact he has some cuts and bruises. the cops are out looking for them, and they have double-crossed some dangerous criminals. then when florence finally shows up out at the fort where leon is, leon, who has already been blubbering, which seemed completely out of character for him, does still more bawling around, and florence sort of comforts him in a rough kind of way. so were the two of them lovers, or what? we discover carol is really patty, and then she hops a freight train?! she did not even know she was going to be out there by the train tracks - after all the original plan did not involve driving out to the fort. so what was her original plan? or did she just see an opportunity and take it? whoever decides to watch this film, i wish them luck in getting more out of it than i did.\",\n"," 'of the 30 or so hitchcock films i have seen so far, this was by far my least favorite. it has some rare hitchcock touches, as with the superimposed \"candidates\" in the chair (i loved

making the list. still, it serves as a window into the world of 70+ years ago, and is an interesting glimpse into the early career of the greatest director who has ever lived.',\n"," \"the split starts as career criminal mac mcclain (jim brown) arrives back in los angeles, there he hooks up with his ex-wife ellie (diahann carroll) & his associate gladys (julie harris). mac says he needs 'a big job' & gladys tells him about a plan she has to steal half a million dollars in takings from the 80,000 plus seater colleseum football stadium during the match between the los angeles rams & the green bay packers, the match has no advance ticket sales so every seat has to be paid for in cash on the day at the gate. mac likes the idea & sets out recruiting a gang to pull it off, the muscle is supplied by bert clinger (ernest borgnine), the wheel man is harry kifka (jack klugman), the weapons man & shooter is dave negli (donald sutherland) & the professional hi-tech thief, lock picker & safe-cracker is marty gough (warren oates). everything is prepared & the day of the heist arrives... directed by gordon flemyng this late 60's crime heist action thriller is unfairly rather obscure but is worth the effort to track a copy down, although you can compare the split to the italian job (1969) since they are both 60's heist films the split was made & released a year before. the script by robert sabaroff was based on the novel 'the seventh' by donald e. westlake can be divided into three chunks, the first third of the film revolves around the recruiting of the team with some fun set-pieces to make sure each member is up to the task, the second third of the film is my favourite when they carry out the heist & there's that feeling that you root for them & you want to get away with it & all the close calls they have & watching the plan unfold is pretty fun, then the final third of the film is perhaps the weakest as several random events come together & tear the thieves apart & it becomes a rather dull runaround after the money which goes missing through no fault of their own but does obviously cause problems as they do not know who to trust. that's about it really. i would have been happy if the split had ended after the gang had stolen the money & got away with it but there's this tacked on ending a lot of which feels very random, like how did ellie's landlord know she had the money? why leave the money in such an exposed place? then there's the ending when everyone gets shot & it just all seems rather pointless. the plot would not work now of course, what with the amount of cctv's & security, the fact a lot of people pay by credit card & i do not understand why the gang do not try to cover their faces. they rob the place without any mask's or gloves so if the hostages do not identify them their finger prints surely would? for such a well planned robbery that's quite a big oversight, is not it? director flemyng does a good job, he keeps the film moving along & it always feels like something is happening. the character's are also very good with each member of the gang having a distinct personality & getting at least a few minutes screen time to develop it although mcclain is hard to like as the lead character since he only seems interested in serving himself. the split was apparently the first film to be given an 'r' rating by the mpaa thanks to some fun fights, a few shoot-outs, a bit of mild bad language (although the 'n' word is used here in a casual fashion, something unthinkable these days especially when the imdb flags it as a 'prohibited word' as i have just found out...) & a bit of blood. there's also a neat car chase here as well. it's somewhat surprising that the split is such an obscure film with it's crowd pleasing heist plot & the top drawer cast but it is, last night i saw a full widescreen 2:35:1 panavision print of this & while the colours were a bit washed out & a bit pastel it looked very nice. technically the film is very good, it has good production values, good stunt work & nice cinematography. the one aspect of the split i do not like is the music, it's horrible & dates the film more than anything else in it. damn, just look at that cast. there are not many films that boast a cast as good as the split. jim brown, ernest borgnine, julie harris, warren oates, the peerless jack klugman, donald sutherland & gene hackman. the acting is top notch from one of the best cast of character actors your ever likely to see in the same film. the split is a good heist film that starts out like the italian job but goes in a significantly darker direction although not to the films overall benefit in my opinion. i liked it as a one time watch & the cast are great but i am not sure i would want to see it again anytime soon.\",\n"," 'director warren beatty\\'s intention to turn chester gould\\'s famous comic strip into a live-action cartoon (with beatty himself cast in the lead as the

it adds to the mediocrity! and try to find young michel serrault, the future great actor of french cinema, in a bit part as a musician, in his very first movie. good luck!',\n"," \"an absolutely wonderful carne/prevert jeu d'esprit that owes more to the modernist whimsy of a rene clair than the claustrophobic pessimism of their later works. although acclaimed as the greatest exponents of poetic realism, films like quai des brumes and le jour se leve can be seen today as flagrantly artificial, most especially in the sets and almost classical plots. here, they let the artifice run riot, allowing plots run into strange digressions or non-sequiters. the sense of freedom absent from their more famous works is invigorating. set in edwardian england, archibald soper is a lecherous, hypocritical, poker-faced bishop who holds sparsely attended public meetings denouncing the evils of detective fiction, apparently an english 'craze' of the time. his cousin, irwin molyneaux, is a timid gardener married to a splendidly imperious snob, margaret. he writes, unknown to his family, hugely successful detective novels under the pseudonym felix chapel, with plots pilfered from his maid's hyperactive milkman admirer, billy. one day, soper forces himself on the molyneaux for dinner, but margaret has exasperated her cooking staff too far, and they have vamoosed. aghast at the potential humiliation of having no servants, she pretends to be visiting friends and cooks the meal herself. however, irwin's ineptness at deceit leads soper to report a murder to scotland yard. the film's starting point is the english fondness for detective fiction, and much of the film's humour, its sense of the absurd, its command of farce, its playing with appearance and class, gives the film an english comic eccentricity, rarely found in the french cinema. drole, however, is the complete opposite of the typical english detective novel, which offers an opening chaos and enigma, with the social disruption of a crime and a series of wildly disparate clues and leads, but achieves order and social restoration through the figure of the detective who can see, interpret and control everything. in drole, following chesterton, say, rather than conan doyle, events start in relative order - characters are firmly set in their social positions. but as the plot proceeds, as characters are revealed to be leading double lives, as the profusion of secondary characters complicates rather than explicates the story, as events become more preposterous and unlikely, the social divisions represented by clear-cut spaces are blurred, and the film escalates into chaos represented by the mob, that great terror of the english, spilling into the narrative, destroying the respectable middle-class home, flouting and mocking the law, making its own judgements. the resolution, such as it is, is a complete lie, because there is no crime, and yet it is brilliantly subversive because it completely disrupts the duplicitous order at the beginning, it alienates people living convenient compartmentalised lives from themselves, forcing them to confront, if only for a moment, their true desires, which contradict their public faces, drole is ridiculously funny, and prevert's arch theatricality has never been used to greater effect. another plus is one of the most remarkable casts ever assembled - michel simon is immensely touching as the bemused gardener forced to abandon the comforts of his mimosa for the chaos of life on the run (private property being the conservative definition of self); francoise rosay is incomparable as the grande dame, besotted by social propriety, yet seething with untapped lust; the young jean-louis barrault is a little callow compared to his seasoned elders, but endearingly impudent - the scene in the greenhouse pond with rosay is a mock-classical treasure. standing out, though, is possibly the greatest french actor of the 1930s, louis jouvet, the funniest straight man in the film, keeping his gloriously calm poker-face through all kinds of humiliations and revelations, including the donning of an elaborate kilt to find an incriminating picture from an 'actress'. best of all is carne's style, completely unrestrained, unafraid to go for 'gag'-like effects (the mugging of dandies for buttonholes is particularly piquant), beavering through fairy-tale sets that do for london what top hat did for venice, completely at ease with the farce, yet still pulling off evocative shots that reveal the emotional reality behind the nonsense.\",\n"," 'i liked the movie and think it was well done. it was not so much about anarchy as it was about the rite of passage into adulthood of one kid. the anarchy and nihilism were just backdrops. the film did a nice job of depicting the journey, the coming of age process, that the main character goes through. puck had a history of being a part of one group or another, and he was very comfortable as part of this anarchist collective. the movie depicts his personal growth, how he begins to reflect and think for himself and become discontent with the collective. he takes a few tentative steps away from the group, and returns - after coming up against challenges when he strikes out on his own or gets pulled back in by other members. finally when it comes down to the line, a crisis situation that is going to affect the rest of his life, he grows into his own skin and decisively chooses his own path.',\n"," 'this is a movie about the music that is currently being played in istanbul. istanbul was the center of the two old world superpowers, the byzantine empire and the ottoman empire. today, it is a megalopolis of almost 10 million. so it is to no ones surprise that a lot of music is being played in istanbul, with a great variety of voices, styles, and influences from everywhere on the globe. it is turkish music, of course, and i was fascinated by turkish music ever since i bought my first record long time ago. the movie features different singers, instrumentalists and bands. spoken comments from the musicians nicely illustrate the music being played, and the social context in modern turkey. for my perspective, the most interesting comments were from orhan gencebay. furthermore, the movies shows urban scenery mainly from istanbul which is very pleasant to watch. \"crossing the bridge\" is listed as a documentary and it includes music from minorities, e.g. kurds and roma. other important topics are omitted such as turkish jazz music, or music of the armenians and greeks. this movie is strongly recommended for lovers of the music and culture of turkey, the balkans, the eastern mediterranean, and the middle east. it may also be worthwhile for those with a keen interest in the global effects of musical styles such as rock and roll or hip hop.',\n"," 'wow i really liked this movie, william h. macy is great as the quiet hit-man alex. all the performances here are

warrior on the hood hightailing it down the highway for the beach with surfboards strapped to the top of their car. brian (chris pine of \"star trek\") is driving and his girlfriend bobby (piper perabo of \"coyote ugly\")has shotgun, while brian\\'s younger brother, danny (lou taylor pucci of \"fanboys\") and his friend--not exactly girlfriend--kate (emily vancamp of \"the ring 2\") occupy the backseat. this quartet of twentysomething characters are living in a nightmare. apparently, a viral pandemic--which co-directors & co-scenarists alex pastor and david pastor tell us absolutely nothing about--has devastated america. naturally, the lack of exposition shaves off at least fifteen minutes that would have slowed down this cynical melodrama about how humans degenerate in a crisis and become their own worst enemies. this lethal virus gives you the shingles and then you bleed and die. most everybody runs around wearing those white masks strapped to their nose and mouth by a thin rubber band. initially, this foursome encounters a desperate father, frank (christopher meloni of \"runaway bride\"),and his cute little daughter jodie (kiernan shipka of \"land of the lost\") blocking the highway with their suv. brian swerves around frank when he tries to waylay them, but in the process, the oil pan in their mercedes ruptures and they wind up on foot. reluctantly, they hitch a ride with frank after they seal jodie up in the rear of the suv. she wears a mask over her nose and mouth and it is speckled with blood. frank has heard that doctors are curing ailing people at a hospital and they head to it. sadly, somebody has lied to frank. the hospital physician is giving the last couple of kids some kool-aid that will put them out of their misery. the cure did not improve their condition. everybody else in town is dead. kate tries without success to get a dial tone on every phone. frank realizes that there is no hope for his daughter and he lets the heroic quartet appropriate his suv and take off. indeed, \"carriers\" qualifies as a relentlessly depressing movie about the effects of a pandemic on four sympathetic people who degenerate into homicidal murderers to protect themselves. they reach a country club and frolic around on a golf course until another four show up in suits and masks with pump-action shotguns. incredibly, our protagonists manage to escape without getting shot, but brian has a scare when he almost falls into the water with a floating corpse. eventually, they discover that one of them has become infected. later, as they are about to run out of gas, brian blocks the highway like frank did at the outset. danny tries to stop a pair of older christian women driving the car. danny lies that his pregnant wife is about to give birth and he needs their help. brian throws caution to the wind and blasts away at the ladies with his automatic pistol when they refuse to help them. brian catches a slug in the leg from the passenger, but he kills her. no,\"carriers\" is not a beer & pizza movie that you can either laugh off or laugh with because the humor is virtually non-existent. by the end of this 84-minute movie, our heroes have turned into villains who only care only for themselves and their plight. chris pine makes quite an impression as fun-loving brian and his energetic performance is the only reason to hang with this hokum, while the only other well-known actress, piper perabo, is relegated to an inconsequential girlfriend role. as bobby, she makes tragic the mistake of showing compassion to a dying little girl and pays an awful price. it is a testament to pine\\'s performance that he can change his character to the point of putting himself before others. essentially, pine has the only role that gives him the ability to pull a one-eighty from happy-go-lucky guy to heartless guy. the two directors are spanish brothers, and they never let the momentum flag. since there is no relief in sight, \"carriers\" sinks into predictability. \"irréversible\" cinematographer benoît debie does a fantastic job with his widescreen lensing and as unsavory as this road trip becomes, debie makes it look like a dynamic film. aside from the lack of a happy ending or closure in any sense of the word, \"carriers\" suffers because it is so horribly cynical. the scene when the german shepherd attacks danny conjures up the most suspense, but even it could have been improved. unfortunately, the pastor brothers do not scare up either much tension or suspense. by fade-out, you really do not care what happens to anybody.',\n"," 'an opium den, a dirty little boy (actually a midget), prostitutes galore, a violent fracas in a dive, a motel for sexual shenanigans, scantily clad babes with cleavage a lot, a boozer falling down the stairs, a racially mixed clientèle in a bar with asians, africans, and anglos treated equally, does this sound like a film playing at the local shopping mall? wrong. these are all scenes from a 1933 musical. the first half of \"footlight parade\" is preparation for a musical extravaganza which occupies the last half of the film. chester kent (cagney) is about to lose his job and does lose his playgirl wife as a result of talking pictures squeezing out live stage musicals. his producers take him to see a popular talky of the day, john wayne in \"the big trail.\" before each showing of the flick, a dance number is presented as a prologue. shorts, news reels, serials, and cartoons would later serve the purpose. kent gets the idea that a prologue chain would be the road to salvation for the dwindling live musical business. kent is basically an idea man along the lines of choreographer busby berkeley. could it be that cagney\\'s character is patterned after berkeley? could be. in preparation for the prologues, kent learns that his ideas are being stolen by a rival. he uncovers the traitor, fires him, then unbeknown to him a new leak is planted in the form a dazzling temptress. his assistant, nan prescott (joan blondell - soon to be mrs. dick powell) has the hots for kent and is determined to expose the wiles of the temptress. a new singer from arkansas college shows up in the form of scotty blain (dick powell) who turns out to be a real find and is paired with bea thorn (ruby keeler). the resulting three prologue musicals, which could not possibly have been presented on any cinema stage of the day, are as fresh and enjoyable today as they were over seventy years ago, \"honeymoon hotel,\" \"by a waterfall,\" and \"shanghai lil.\" of special note is the song and dance of tough-guy james cagney. like fred astaire and bill \"bojangles\" robinson, cagney\\'s dancing appeared natural and unrehearsed, although hours went into practice to get each step just right. not as good a singer as astaire, cagney\\'s singing, like astaire\\'s, sounded natural, unlike the crooning so popular at the time. it\\'s amazing that one person could be so talented and so versatile as james cagney. most critics prefer the \"shanghai lil\" segment over the other two. yet the kaleidoscopic choreography of \"by a waterfall\" is astonishing. how berkeley was able to film the underwater ballets and to create the human snake chain must have been difficult because it has never been repeated. the close up shots mixed brilliantly with distant angles is a must-see. the crisp black and white photography is much more artistic than it would have been if shot in color. though not nearly as socially conscious as \"gold diggers of 1933,\"

much more to say here. the score just plain sucked. the second problem, which i see as quite severe as well as it involves the unwinding of the plot near the end of the film (one of the the money shots, if you will), is the dialogue between martha (adrienne barbeau) and the sunflower man (richard ziman), in which martha is revealed to be the leader of the experiment. at all times during this dialogue, the viewer is very much aware that s/he is listening to a movie dialogue. in other words, suspension of disbelief breaks down here. the integrity of a believable dialogue between two people is sacrificed for a willy-nilly stuffing of information the movie makers wish to impart to the audience. the third problem was the casting of adrienne barbeau. while i honestly believe her to be a fabulous actress within her oeuvre, i feel that this part may have been too much of a stretch. the main point of her performance that did not seem to mesh was the spectrum across which the character moves through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to an almost rambo-like woman on a mission. this aspect of the script would obviously have been a stretch for any actress, and one cannot place too much blame, therefore, upon barbeau. to the degree that she fairly competently acted her part, however, i would only call this a moderately severe problem to the film as a whole. finally, the film did a wonderful job in the first half building a creep factor, most notably during its horror flashes. i feel that the film would have benefited by more of a commitment to these flashes as a mechanism for preventing a fizzling of the creep factor in the second half of the movie. so what\\'s my holistic grading of this piece? i\\'d give it a solid c+ to b-, depending upon how much credit you are inclined to give the makers for producing this film on a limited budget. even with two severe and two moderately severe problems, the film is premised on the solid plot of the jungian side of nazi mysticism. i see no problems with plot development or coherence; the dialogue, with the noted exception above, is downright brilliant in places, especially the all important keystone scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie; as mentioned, the creep factor was well crafted, if a bit fizzly in the second half; and nicholas brendan, who also associated produced, delivered a wonderful performance. all in all, this film is definitely worth the view--see it with a nazi you love. :)',\n"," \"we saw this years ago on dvd and it has got to be the worst of

there is no cut of any kind. she\\'s just being basted in tobasco sauce. yes, it\\'s shlock. shlocky shlock. super shlocky shlock. at best, you\\'ll laugh. there were some scenes where i laughed out

laughed when i saw her name in the credits. the moniker has \"soft core porn star\" written all over it. the bonus material to the dvd assures me she is a famous horror movie actress who has been in many magazine articles -- fangoria, for example. and she has, they assure me, \"star quality\". well, no. she does not. not really. but she is willing to take off all her clothes. she is sort of cute,

nest then slugs is a must-see as it's ten times better. also worth noting is that lisa langlois who plays elizabeth was in another 'nature run amock' type film called deadly eyes (aka the rats), which is about killer rats as you may have guessed. if you enjoy these types of horror films then you may want to give this a watch, but you'd be far better off seeing slugs which is far more interesting

her. they have good chemistry together. but the other two americans also play their roles nicely. i did not really find anything annoying about the acting, so thumbs up for that! the effects on the

sunshine marks the return of director lee changdong to the film-making world after a multi-year absence. having three critically acclaimed films already under his belt, he recruits now veteran thespian jeon doyeon and her considerable (cannes-winning) talents for the primary role of lee shinae. what follows is a journey through one woman's tragedy and an exploration of her coping mechanisms. one of the things that becomes apparent while watching secret sunshine is that it does not really care to follow any specific genre, but rather picks up genre traits when necessary to convey what it's trying to convey. the story itself follows lee shinae as she moves with her son to the city of milyang (whose sino-corean translates to secret sunshine). she moves to milyang in the aftermath of the death of her husband as it was his hometown, so the film is born from tragedy. and you think things might just get better as she opens up a piano shop and encounters a bit of a bumbling nice-guy mechanic jongchan (played by song kangho). but this is not a romantic comedy. as we (and jongchan, doggedly) follow shinae as she encounters milyang and the fate that it has in store for her, the cracks in her armor quickly become apparent. she is a troubled woman trying to grasp onto her own strength to overcome tragedy and we watch as she finds that it's not enough. secret sunshine still manages to follow a mostly aristotelian dramatic arc, but pulls back on the catharsis, which might confound some viewers, especially the ending, but the novelistic symbolism present in the name of milyang, the discussions of sunshine and the imagery used in the film very well left me satisfied, once i started to think over the film some more. ms. jeon is rather impressive throughout, especially considering that if the role were any less well played, it would have quickly turned into a rather painful melodrama, but she captures the nuances of shinae's attempts to deal with her losses with a layer of subtlety. mr. song has a much smaller role in this film than other films, but he performs adequately, appropriately giving stage to ms. jeon. technically, the film is well done in a classical sense. no flashy aesthetics are employed here--the director is clearly trying to let the story tell itself. i think my only real complaint, and one that might not be able to be fixed, is that despite all the time we spend with shinae, there is a bit of distance between shinae and the audience (or at least, me). i think some of this stems from the nature of the work, because if total empathy were pushed, then we would not be able to see the problems that shinae has objectively. on the other hand, i never felt moved along with shinae's plight, despite her many tears and increasingly erratic behavior. all the same, the film still stands quite impressive, especially in that it stimulated me to think about it, the further meanings present in it and its ruminations on tragedy, coping, self-deception, isolation and faith stuck with me well after the credits had finished running. propelled by a strong lead performance, i honestly did not notice its 2.25 hour runtime. and that says something. well done. 8/10.\",\n"," \"central airport is the story of a pilot named jim (richard barthelmess) who has one bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced

pansy played to the twittery hilt by character actor johnny arthur which never demeans or denigrates his character. mr. arthur is great in his role of homer erskine bringing great comic relief as the secretary of the broadway producer herman wood, played by another great character actor richard carle. they play off of each other superbly. although the acceptable words of the time sissy and cream puff are used to describe the character of homer, it is never mean spirited or meant as denigration, and are not spoken by the manly males of the film but by his employer, who fires and rehires him every other scene and who displays an almost exasperated affection for his devoted employee. there is a great scene where homer tells his boss that he has devoted the best years of his life to him and has been everything but a mother to him. the mystery angle of the film is very entertaining, and the twist at the end might just leave you in stitches. for a low budget poverty row picture, this film has superb set decoration and great costuming. director frank strayer ably handles his cast and this film holds together much better than some of his other low budget mystery attempts, but he had a great script to work with and some wonderful actors to carry it through. this film is a must see for devotees of poverty row films, old dark house mysteries (they actually managed to work in the lines

melodrama all right. two boys of very different backgrounds are orphaned when a pleasure steamer catches fire and sinks in the hudson river near new york in 1902. one boy (mickey rooney) is a rough and tumble type, while the other is bookish and thoughtful. they are both briefly adopted together by a man who lost his son in the same disaster. they grow up together and then go their separate ways. the rough one, 'blackie', becomes a criminal and is played by clarke gable. the bookish one becomes a lawyer and criminal prosecutor, played by william powell. blackie has a girlfriend, played by myrna loy, who leaves him for powell. what is so especially fascinating about this film is that myrna loy and clark gable do not 'click' at all, and glaze over when they look at one another, despite their best acting efforts to simulate at least some flickers of passion. but as soon as powell and loy are on screen together, the fizz begins, and they spark off one another like two cheeky little flints who just can not wait to make wonderful fire together. powell seems to have been an irresistibly amusing man who was attractive to all the most glamorous gals, despite not being all that good-looking. after all, he was married to carole lombard and then was about to marry jean harlow when she died tragically. (he paid $30,000 for her funeral and took six weeks off filming with myrna loy in another picture because of his uncontrollable grief.) so powell certainly knew how to interact with women of character. myrna loy just had the right kind of wry and whimsical manner to complement the dry humour of powell. from the moment they first look at each other in this first film together, a unique screen magic was born, and lasted through 14 films. when i knew her very slightly as a youngster, she was 57 and rather uncommunicative, and she seemed depressed, so i never knew the 'lively loy'. in those days videos and dvds did not exist, so few people of my age had any idea at all of what she had been like in her films with william powell, as we had not only never seen any of them but had no way of doing so. nor was there any internet with a handy imdb database where you just click your mouse and see the list of her credits. the fact is, myrna loy was someone one knew had been a big movie star earlier on, but one had never actually seen her on screen. she was just a name, and someone who had been in films which one's parents had seen before one was born. well, now we can see them and so many of them are good that we can at last see myrna loy in perspective and appreciate just how unique and special she really was. there is a curious thing, namely that her real name was myrna williams and she came from montana. now who does that remind you of? why, michelle williams of course, who comes from montana (see my reviews of land of plenty and incendiary, where i note that this girl is an actress of genius). i wonder if they could possibly be montana kith and kin. but i guess the world is full of people named williams, even in montana, which has a population of just a few thousand people and a few million cattle, does not it? it seems that everywhere you go, there are people named wiliams. perhaps it is because they are plural. oh, back to the story. i always forget the story. well, you can see it coming, can not you? powell ends up prosecuting gable for murder and demands the death sentence. that part of the story is heavily contrived, but it works very well regardless because after all it is a 1930s movie. loy is distressed because she loves them both. you can see where the melodrama comes in, and they really lay it on, as this is not a film where subtlety is a leading quality. we get the whole thing, death row, the last minute requests for a reprieve (oh yes, powell is governor of new york by now and is the one who gets begged to save blackie's life). well the melodrama just keeps piling on top of the melodrama like that, so that the film is really a kind of melodramatic club sandwich. there is some cheese and then there's some ham (in fact there is no shortage of ham in this film) and then there's some chicken when certain persons lose their courage and then there's some lettuce to brighten and pretty things up a bit, and then there's the daily bread, it's all there. take a bite, it's really delicious.\",\n"," \"this is the story of linda eastman mccartney. her early life as a music magazine photographer. her meeting and

to the action elements (being young and somewhat immature in my dramatic tastes), but i was blown away by the romance and character interplay. i loved the composition of the scenes, the noirish lighting, and the quirky humor. this movie, along with pedro almodovar\\'s films, really opened my eyes to european films, particularly those with a signature style. the performances are great across the board. anne parillaud plays all facets of nikita well, from her rebellious, drug-hazed beginning, to her growing confidence, and her near breakdown as her mission falls apart. tcheky karyo made a huge impression, mostly through his body language and his eyes. he says more with an expression than most actors do with dialogue. jeanne moraeu is a treasure, a truly beautiful woman in appearance and spirit. jean-hughues anglade has the harder part, the \"normal\" guy who nikita falls for. he is adept at comedy, but is tender in the love scenes. he carries himself well in his face-off with bob. finally, the actor who really stands out in memory, jean reno. reno oozes charisma and talent, even in bad films. he steals the film the moment he enters. luc besson is a tremendous stylist. his films are beautiful, even when the story is a bit obtuse. he is adept at using light to portray and enhance emotion and his compositions are stunning. his main fault is that he lets style overtake story, but he gets away with it because the style is always interesting. he is a fine writer, although more care seems to go into the scripts he directs than those he has written for others. finally, one can not discuss the films of besson without discussing the music of eric serra. serra creates an atmosphere that is much a part of the setting as the lighting or set decoration. his compositions convey mood and emotion, adding another layer to the story. his signature bass and percussion gets your heart pumping during action sequences, while the melodies bring a softness to intimate moments. he demonstrates the proper way to use synthesizers, to transform the music, rather than make up for lack of an orchestra (or talent). serra\\'s soundtracks were the first that i bought for instrumental music, rather than for pop songs used in the film. this is a film that appeals to many audiences. there is plenty of action and intrigue for thrillseekers, unique character studies, quirky humor, and above all, romance. it has spawned many imitations (point of no return, black cat, nikita tv series) but has never been equaled. if you are a fan of film noir, action/espionage, character drama, or romance, you should see this film; then you should own this film. you\\'ll want to watch it again and again.',\n"," 'i\\'d like to point out that this movie is literally based on first hand recollections of a prostitute interviewed in al rose\\'s definitive book on the subject: \"storyville\", published many years ago. anyone familiar with with the era knows that the photographer, e.j. bellocq, was a real person who captured on glass plates forever the images of the young prostitutes of storyville. these photographs are hauntingly beautiful in their own right, and the young brooke shields--as well as the beautiful susan sarandon--were a masterstroke of malle to play the parts of mother and daughter prostitutes. the recollections in the book draw upon the actual fact that the mother who related the story actually took part in the deflowering of her daughter in the \"house\" as described, and that they went on to be a \"team\", a very common and desirable commodity in that day. not mentioned-- but inferred to those who \"read between the lines\"-- was that the pony that young violet casually rides in the backyard of the mansion in the beginning of the movie was actually an animal used to entertain the paying customers in \"the circus\" that certain women performed in... for the\"right price.\" many of the photo sessions depicted in the film are loving recreations of surviving bellocq prints. the women portraying the \"girls\" in the movie could have been working girls in \"the district\" had they lived back then. some imdb readers profess to be shocked by conditions in storyville back then, but as the book recounts, it was all true, and many of the women actually did enjoy their livelyhood. it was the \"bluenoses\" to the rescue who saved them and the u.s. navy from themselves, just as they would save the nation from \"drink\" a few years later. although ragtime and jazz are touched on in the movie, storyville was directly responsible for the likes of young louis armstrong--who ran coal from house to house--picking up the street melodies he heard and playing them on a cornet furnished to him--providentially--by the local orphanage, and for ferdinand \"jelly roll\" morton, pianist... and pimp... who played in only the best houses and claimed he invented the term \"jazz\" as applied to music after witnessing first hand all that \"jassing-around\" he saw in the bordellos of storyville! remarkeably, overlooked altogether is any mention of the composer of the tune \"pretty baby,\" professor tony jackson, a key figure of the storyville saga, who should have been the character portrayed in the film but was not, and who was not even mentioned in the credits. as for bellocq himself not much is known except that he was slightly deformed and not interested in the ladies at all sexually-- the marriage to violet merely a modern plot device--but he professed his deep fascination and reverence for them, thankfully, in other ways: his portraits. without them, a poignant record of their lives,and that of the district, would be lost forever. all in all, the film is a wonderful paean to bellocq, and the women he loved in his own way. i would urge all critics of this movie to seek out a copy of \"storyville, new orleans\" by al rose, or moma\\'s \"e.j. bellocq: storyville portraits.\" they will really open yours eyes to what louis malle has recreated.',\n"," 'sorry to go against the flow but i thought this film was unrealistic, boring and way too long. i got tired of watching gena rowlands long arduous battle

it.',\n"," 'i was intrigued by the title, so during a small bout of insomnia (fueled by my curiosity...), i stayed up and watched it. i then checked my tv listings and watched it again! there is one very obvious realization that occurred to me when i saw this film- in spite of politics, traditions, culture, etc., teenagers everywhere are virtually the same. the characters of the kids from belgrade could have been transported to, let\\'s say, somewhere in the american midwest during the same time period, and language differences aside, would be impossible to tell apart from any of the local teens of that era. they certainly displayed the same growing pains and preoccupations, politics aside: music, sex, movie idols, music, drinking, sports, music... as a matter of fact, much the same things that occupied my time growing up in 1970\\'s southern california. this was a bittersweet story, but the joy of youth made it very enjoyable. the characters, especially the young actors, were completely believable also. i will not say this was the yugoslav \"american graffiti\", but i will say that it fits in nicely with other 50\\'s-themed movies.',\n"," 'this was painful. i made myself watch it until the end, even though i had absolutely no interest in the plot, if there was one. my patience was not rewarded. the ending was even worse than the rest of the film. chucky walks into the hospital with a priest and his concubine says \"i do\". how vile can one movie be?',\n"," 'juice is a well made drama that focuses on 4 kids who just get tangled up in a bad situation. it is well directed by ernest dickerson and it has a lot of style. good cast. worth a watch.',\n"," 'i ran across this several years ago while channel surfing on a sunday afternoon. though it was obviously a cheesy tv movie from the 70s, the direction and score were well done enough that it grabbed my attention, and indeed i was hooked and had to watch it through to the end. i recently got the opportunity to buy a foreign dvd of this film (oops, did not notice a domestic one had finally come out a couple months prior), and was very pleased to be able to watch it again (and in its entirety). i do not wholly understand the phenomenon, but somehow the 70s seem to have a lock on horror movies that are actually scary. the decades prior to the 70s produced some beautifully shot films and the bulk of our enduring horror icons, but are they actually scary? no, not very. likewise in the years since the 70s we have gotten horror movies that are cooler, more exciting, have much better production values and sophisticated special effects, are more fun, funnier, have effective \"jump\" moments, and some very creative uses of gore, but again... they are not really scary! there\\'s just something about the atmosphere of the 70s horror films. the grainy film quality. the spookily dark scenes unilluminated by vast high-tech lighting rigs. the \"edge of dreamland\" muted quality of the dialogue and the weird and stridently eq\\'d scores. the odd sense of unease and ugliness permeating everything. everything that works to undermine most movies of the 70s, in the case of horror, works in its favor. specifically, in this film, the quiet, intense shots of the devil dog staring people down is fairly unnerving. so much more effective than if they had gone the more obvious route of having the dog be growling, slavering, and overtly hostile (\"cujo\"?). the filmmakers wisely save that for when the dog appears in its full-on supernatural form. the effects when that occurs, while unsophisticated by today\\'s standards, literally gave me chills. the bizarre, vaguely-defined, \"i am not quite sure what i am looking at\" look intuitively strikes me as more like how a real supernatural vision would be, rather than the hyper-real, crystal clear optical printer / digital compositor confections of latter-day horror films. while the human characters in this film are not as satisfyingly rendered as their nemesis or the world they inhabit, the actors all do a decent job. the pairing of the brother and sister from the \"witch mountain\" movies as, yes, brother and sister, is a rather cheesy bit of stunt casting, but they do fine. yvette mimieux always manages to be entertaining if unspectacular. richard crenna earns more and more empathy from the audience as the film progresses. his self-doubt as he wonders whether his family\\'s alienness is truly due to a supernatural plot or whether he\\'s merely succumbing to paranoid schizophrenia is pretty well handled, though his thought that getting a routine physical may provide an explanation for what he\\'s been experiencing is absurd in its naïveté. the movie\\'s the-end-question-mark type ending is one of the only ones i have seen that does not feel like a cheap gimmick, and actually made me think about the choices these characters would be faced with next and what they\\'d be likely to do and how they\\'d feel about it. detractors of this film may say it\\'s merely a feature-length vehicle for some neato glowing retina shots, but hey, you could say the same thing about \"blade runner\". :-)',\n"," 'i

essence of the natural world, right? some animals prey on others, climate changes in natural cycles. polar bears survived the last stint of global warming just fine. the ice sheets were so small 1000

cemetery, reading. while every ghost rose from the graves to \"boo\" people, casper decides to leave in search for a friend. but in trying to make a friend, anyone who sees casper runs away. poor casper sat on a log and weep; until a little fox cub comes up an nuzzles him. casper and the little fox quickly bond and he quickly names the cub ferdie and considers him to be his very best friend. casper and ferdie\\'s relationship is put in tremendous jeopardy however when casper is not keeping a close eye on ferdie while they are playing a game of hide and seek. while ferdie is hiding a hunter and two of his hunting dogs come and try to kill little ferdie and ferdie is running as fast as possible until he is out of breath and starts panting. while the hunter is firing gunshots towards ferdie casper notices they are trying to kill him and flies in the hunter\\'s direction and pleads that the hunter leaves ferdie alone. and the hunter and dogs are terrified of casper. casper yells to ferdie that the hunter and the dogs are gone and that everything is fine. but casper sees ferdie\\'s body is not moving and asks if he is ok. when casper sees ferdie has died he starts mourning in pain because he lost \"the only friend he ever had in his whole life.\" casper returns back to the cemetery where he has buried ferdie and has made a gravestone for him next to casper\\'s gravestone. casper continues mourning in pain until he sees that ferdie has resurrected as a ghost himself. ferdie starts licking casper on his cheek. casper screams for joy because he has been reunited with ferdie. overall, it is a really good short; though surprisingly disturbing, showing death in a family-oriented cartoon.',\n"," \"brian yuzna is often frowned upon as a director for his trashy gore-fests, but the truth is that his films actually are not bad at all. the re-animator sequels are not as great as the original, but are still worthy as far as horror sequels are concerned. return of the living dead 3 is the best of the series; and society is not a world away from being a surrealist horror masterpiece. this thriller certainly is not a masterpiece; but it shows yuzna's eye for horror excellently, and the plot moves in a way that is always thrilling and engaging. i am really surprised that a horror movie about dentistry did not turn up until 1996, as going to the dentist is almost a primal fear - it's running away from a tiger for the modern world. dentistry does not frighten me, but surprisingly; i would appear to be in the minority. the plot follows perfectionist dentist dr feinstone. he has a nice house, a successful career and a beautiful wife - pretty much everything most people want. however, his life takes a turn for the worse when he discovers his wife's affair with the pool cleaner. and his life is not the only one; as it's his patients who feel the full brunt of his anger... when it comes to scaring the audience, this movie really makes itself. however, credit has to go to the director for extracting the full quota of scares from the central theme. the fact that he does a good job is summed up by the fact that i am not squeamish about going to the dentist - yet one particular scene actually made me cover my eyes! the film follows the standard man going insane plot outline, only with the dentist you always get the impression that there's more to the film than what we are seeing. it is not very often that a gore film can impress on a substance level - and while this will not be winning any awards, the parody on the upper class is nicely tied into the plot. the acting, while b-class, is actually quite impressive; with corbin bernsen taking the lead role and doing a good job of convincing the audience that he really is a man on the edge. i should thank brian yuzna for casting ken foree in the movie. the dawn of the dead star does not get enough work, and i really love seeing him in films. the rest of the cast does not massively impress, but all do their jobs well enough. overall, the dentist offers a refreshing change for nineties slasher movies. the gore scenes are sure to please horror fans, and i do not hesitate to recommend this film.\",\n"," 'i keep waiting for peter fonda to start acting. for someone who comes from such a talented family, it\\'s a mystery to me why peter fonda can only play peter fonda trying to play someone else. and, that\\'s the good news in this disappointing dog of an adaptation of the tempest. a string of loosely connected ideas that only suggest a relationship with the bard\\'s great play is what we are served. the setting is the civil war and prospero\\'s (here guideon\\'s) evil brother looks like an 1890\\'s melodrama villain, complete with snidely whiplash moustache. i kept waiting for him to go \"uh ha hah!\" which would have been a high point in this dreary presentation. none of the supporting cast was memoriable and peter fonda\\'s lack of expression and wooden body movements made the lackadaisical story drag on and on. the tempest is the bard\\'s statement about the rage of man\\'s unjust treatment of man. the only believable character was the gator man, the caliban counterpart. the transferrence to the swamp had possibilities but the civil war setting just did not make it. all in all, a very disappointing production. i saw it on

scholarship to college and could play like ray was an asset to the director. what could be better than that? you do not have to have a \"double\" play piano and then try to split the screen from someone else\\'s hands to jamie\\'s face. it worked beautifully. i loved the fact that it also picked up how difficult ray was. he was not always a nice man. you did not also root for him. he was a drug addict, a womanizer, and sometimes just plain hard-headed. but i guess that\\'s what made him genius so i can not fault him for that. i pick jamie for best actor!',\n"," 'a historical note: although tons of pictures of vikings with horned helmets have been produced over the years, this is actually a myth. they never, to our knowledge, wore such helmets. and, if you think about it, this makes sense, as the horns would make such a helmet unwieldy and difficult to wear. plus, you might get stuck going through doorways! this traditional view of vikings is more the wagnerian view of the people. in fact, the wonderful movie \"the vikings\" is so wonderful, in part, because it gets this point correct. also, while this might disappoint you, most historians do not believe king arthur ever lived or if he did, the stories about him are all false. the stories you read about him were often written as much as 1000-1300 years after he was to have lived and vary tremendously--and they are essentially myths. sorry to spoil this for you, but i was a history teacher--and i love debunking myths. the film begins with valiant (robert wagner) being sent by his daddy the king (donald crisp) to the court of king arthur to become a knight. crisp\\'s friend, hidden under all that makeup and hair, is victor mclaglen, by the way. it seems that crisp has had his kingdom stolen from him and why he would then choose to send his son away is a bit of a mystery. what also is a mystery is why a viking would go to the uk and serve arthur. oh well, it\\'s no worse than a film i saw years ago where a saracen (who were from the middle east) was also in arthur\\'s court! at least scandinavia is kind of near britain! on his way there, he stumbles upon a viking making a dirty deal with a brit--and accidentally stumbles into the midst of the traitors. he manages to escape(!) but is now a man pursued by many who wish to bash in his skull! in addition to avoid getting killed, much of the film concerns valiant\\'s new career as a squire. while he hates to have such a lowly job, such is the way to career advancement in the knighthood game. oh, and by the way, knights were not the noble dudes you see in the film. mostly, they were used to beat up the peasants for their lords and fight various wars. they were an incredibly violent and non-chivalrous group and i\\'d love to see a film portray them like they really were--often, a bunch of raping, murdering scalawags. now that would make for an interesting film! so, as you can tell, i hate this film for its many, many inaccuracies. however, i can enjoy such a film on purely an entertainment level. so is it entertaining and worth seeing? well at least on a aesthetic level, it\\'s a nice film. it has the wonderful touches that you\\'d expect from an a-picture from twentieth-century fox. great music, lovely period costumes, wonderful locations and nifty castles--it sure looked wonderful (though the castles used were all built much too late for the time period in the film--gosh, that history teacher in me is rearing up its ugly head again). as for the writing, dialog and acting, it\\'s not a film that impresses. much of the dialog seems strangely anachronistic and dull. some is even rather dumb (such as when janet leigh confronts valiant at the 50 minute mark). the characters all seem a bit flat and dull. the actors, though often accomplished, are not at their best here. sterling hayden, a wonderful actor, just seems out of place as does james mason. the biggest problem, however, is robert wagner. in this period in the 1950s he was very much an up and coming actor--having starred in quite a few plum roles. however, hollywood often did not seem to know how to use this handsome man--putting him in films that simply did not seem to fit him. here, he plays a viking and in \"broken lance\" (also 1954), they cast him as a macho cattle rancher! i mean no disrespect, but he was not the action hero sort of guy. he would have been better in romances or such films as \"a kiss before dying\"--where he very effectively played a guy who romanced and then murdered women. you can not blame wagner for these roles--he was young and the studios paid well... and they were starring roles. too bad he just was not right for them--and his accent and manner seemed to have nothing to do with vikings. i would have much preferred to see some rugged ruffian in the role instead (such as ernest borgnine or victor mature). as far as action goes, for an adventure film it is strangely static and filled with dialog. i would have loved a good castle siege or sacking here and there throughout the film... and i kept waiting and waiting and it only came too late--after i was pretty bored with the film. sure, there were a few nice attempted murders here and there (cool) but not enough to make the film seem \"actiony\"--instead, it was much too much like a stuffy costume drama much of the time. now if i wanted to watch a rousing and completely historically inaccurate film, there are a lot of dandy ones out there. \"ivanhoe\" and \"the adventures of robin hood\" are fantastic costume dramas and are first-class entertainment. and, if you are some sort of weirdo and want to actually see something with more realism and accuracy (but with tons of really, really cool action), try \"the vikings\"--a rousing and wonderful bit of entertainment that actually touches on some of the themes seen in \"prince valiant\". it is not that this film is terrible (it is not), but there just are a lot better and more entertaining films out there to see first. heck, now that i think of it, \"monty python and the holy grail\" would definitely be my choice as the best arthurian film out there!',\n"," \"terrible film

interesting chase scene. that's how bad this picture is if you have to depend on a chase scene to supply the action. raquel welch plays the beauty up to her neck in intrigue. her acting leads a lot to

there\\'s always going to be that inevitable time when a person just runs out of ideas, and this film seems to be that moment for abbott & costello. the whole of this film seems to me, just a bunch of their old routines and gags run together in order to fill up the running time of a feature film. this is why it\\'s so very difficult, even for veterans like a&c, to keep a film moving, especially at feature length. difficult for the writers first of all, to keep a story together and include comedic bits without it all seeming to be just a patch quilt of non-related ideas. they all went through this at one time or another, i.e. chaplin, keaton, laurel & hardy, etc. that is not to say that this is a totally bad film, just parts of it. the giant \"kong like\" ape that\\'s being searched for, for instance, is just too much. good comedy exaggerates the realistic but never should it traverse into the \"twilight zone\" just for effect. something that\\'s interesting about this film is that there appears a current \"stooge\" with a future \"stooge\", namely shemp howard and joe besser. joe besser was not, in my opinion \"stooge material\" but here with a&c and shemp, he\\'s an actual

over-the-top, but that is true for many lower-budget movies. the aspect of this movie that i really hated, though, was that 90-95% of it is shot on film, but in random places, there will be 5-10 seconds where the footage is shot on video. you can tell because there is less contrast, the colors are less vivid, and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second instead of film's 24 frames per second. i am not sure if maybe these scenes had to be shot later and at that time they did not have the money to shoot on film (i assume this is why, anyway), but it is disorienting and really makes

'\"stargate sg-1\" follows the intergalactic explorations of a team named sg-1 through a device called the stargate and all the surprises awaiting on the other side of the wormhole. having seen this series sporadically for it\\'s first few seasons when it first came out, i did not know how good this series would really be, 10 years after i had last seen an episode. my old impression was that the series was great, but my impression was far from the truth. \"stargate sg-1\" is more than just a simple sci-fi series, it is one of the most well made, interesting, long running, exciting sci-fi ever produced. and why? because it runs on an amazing premise. this series value far surpasses that of the movie it was based on and i think it is a very good example that television, as a medium, with a suitable premise, is able to provide something that does not work on the time restriction of film. the sense of familiarity created by a long running series, watching the characters and their circumstances progressing with time is stunning and just adds to the ability to suspend disbelief, and it\\'s all a result of terrific writing and a lot of dedication by the all crew to the show. \"stargate sg-1\" kept offering great adventures throughout the 10 years, but was never afraid of the challenge of moving the plot and it gave way for some very different time periods of the show: - the first few seasons, perhaps up to the 4th/5th, focused a lot more on the exploration of planets and different situations, keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other if it were not for the always impending goaul\\'d threat. - from the 5th to the 7th there was increasingly more episodes focusing on fighting the goaul\\'d and preventing attacks on earth. after this seasons exploration of the planets was almost only an excuse for putting sg-1 in a place of goaul\\'d/replicator/ori conflicts - the 8th season is probably the most mixed one. it has a stream of episodes that includes minor earth matters in which the stargate is hardly even mentioned, but the last episodes feature some great replicator moments. - the 9th and 10th travel together because they have the same new enemy and no jack o\\'neil. they are both good continuations, although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a little weak, because they seem to be about little more than sg-1 and human/jaffa losing battle after battle to the ori. basically, after season 7, exploration was pushed to the background, which in many ways was a shame, because of the potential and mystery each planet(episode) presented; on the other hand, it made for so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that the change of nature of the show still worked and shows how great and bold the writers were. even tough i believe the series have a high quality ending that nicely puts it to rest, the feeling i have is that it could go on; the people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative had plenty to offer. a last season returning to the beginning nature of the series was very doable and would have been most welcome, but ultimately things are as they are. in the end, because of the fact that i enjoyed everything, it\\'s a little hard to find that it ends. the big picture, however, the one drawn by the work of hundreds of people over the course of 10 years, is a sight of beauty and a true testament to the dedication of the crew, those outstanding actors and the characters the we will always remember as a collective by the name of sg-1.',\n"," 'my family (two 40-somethings, an 8

cartoon shows at the time. i have to admit, of all the cartoons there were this was probably the easiest one to collect all the toys for as they really did not add to many characters to the show as it went along. you basically had liono, panthro, cheetara, the tiger dude (can not remember his name), snarf and the two kid ones. the villains consisted of about three mutants, mummra and a group of pirates that really did not have all that many episodes. there were another set of super berserker warriors and two or three more thundercats introduced in later episodes, but i do not ever recall seeing them as toys. so all in all a good show, with the one story arc of liono having to past these tests facing the other thundercats as one of the highlight multiple part stories.',\n"," 'all the

costuming was well done not overly lavish as some of the movies from the 40's can be. the scenery was confined to a few well done sets. the acting was genuine from almost every character including the young raymond burr. the script did follow the story line of many swashbuckling hero type movies but the quality of the actors made the movie fresh. one of the things i like best about this movie is that the good was truly good and the bad truly bad. there is a theme of redemption for don juan who, in the end, quietly leaves to pursue his life.

not seem to have a storyline, and is supported by the chemistry and improvisations of morgan freeman and paz vega and actually nothing happens along 82 minutes. the ambiguous open conclusion is simply ridiculous, with the character of morgan freeman returning to his silver spoon world and telling the simple worker that they would never see each other again. was he afraid to have a love affair with

spoilers below. first of all, let me be clear and say that i have not seen the original \"friday the 13th\" in over 10 years. it is not a movie that stayed with me in any way - i have always been a fan of halloween / michael meyers. that said, i think i know what makes a good horror film, and i know that none of those things are in this film. my first complaint lies in the structure of the story. the first thirty minutes or so of prologue lend nothing but confusion as to where the story is going. when we find out after the first group of murders who has been kept alive and how they are connected to the second story line (clay\\'s search for his sister), i had spent so much time being repulsed by the group of friends that i really had no emotional stake (re: i could not even remember the character\\'s name) in whether the girl lived or died. my second complaint lies with i expect that there will be the obtuse sex, drinking, and drugs in any \"campy\" horror film like this, but these first 30 minutes were so packed with inane boobs and weed shots that i was ready to consider this a comedy, not a horror film. i am not looking for social commentary when i see a slasher film, but all of the references to marijuana seem like they are being made by people who have never even come in contact with it. it\\'s almost like when you are in high school, bragging about how high you got, and the guy you are talking to lies so that he does not feel stupid for not partaking in substances like that: \"man, i got soo freaking high last night. what\\'d you do at the party?\" \"oh, uhm, i smoked several weed cigarettes and drank a couple brewskis, then passed out.\" apparently, this guy wrote a screenplay for a friday the 13th \"remake\". lastly, although i could probably keep complaining about this film, jason is absolutely not scary in the first half of this movie. by the time we are midway through the second story line (i contend that this movie should have been called: \"friday the 13th: a bunch of douche bags go camping, and jason voorhees is somewhat involved\") there have been so many crappy people on-screen, and they have been killed by jason in typical jason style, he just is not that scary anymore. we know he\\'s there, waiting for the topless girl with fake boobs to swim ashore so he can decapitate her. we know. this film is neither atmospheric, nor does it even attempt to build tension. it is simply a terrible movie. other grievances: the pot-dealing redneck, who is only introduced so that he can be killed and jason can find his hockey mask (a full hour into the film), is the single most disgusting character i have ever seen on-screen. this is not a compliment: just before his \"untimely\" demise, he talks to a mannequin, and asks the mannequin if she \"remembers that night, when (she) took (his) virginity\". i would rather be decapitated by jason than ever hear those words spoken in a film again. why is it that every michael bay production or direction has to include the blue halo / lens flare around electric lights? i noticed this early on, but at one point later in the film, as a flashlight goes across the screen, there is actually a sound effect applied when the lens flare hits the audience. why? how much money did you spend on that? how much time was spent adding that tiny \"swoosh\" into the soundtrack? god, michael, get a freaking life - you can not just add things like that and hope that you have produced a good film. you have not. and you never will.',\n"," 'when this tvm was made in 1999 i was still somewhat

system being deleted , perhaps the good guys were carrying a back up copy of the villains system ? we are also told to believe that some real hot internet systems can not be traced because they do not

entirely with morals and what not, and this show did not do that. yes, there were some, like tackling important issues, such as drugs and bullying, but they did not try and be anything other than a fun family comedy. the way they wrote john's death in to the show was brilliantly done, i still sob like a baby each time i see it. you could feel how raw the emotions were during those incredibly

there has not been anything close. the only good thing i can say is that after watching this i know that i have seen the worst movie i will ever see.',\n"," \"**warning some spoilers** the giant behemoth was one of the last giant monster-on-the-loose films of the 1950's, a decade that saw all manner of creatures born of the two biggest scientific issues of the decade- space exploration and nuclear weapons. behemoth fell into the second category, a genre started with the excellent beast from 20,000 fathoms, and elaborated upon with godzilla and them! however, by the time behemoth rolled before the cameras, the concept of atomically created monsters had already worn thin. nevertheless, this is one of the better films of its type; a real gem made on a budget so tiny that it would not even cover the cost of a current feature's end credit listings! credit for the film's cult reputation must go to the men behind the behemoth. although jack rabin, irving block and louis dewitt are first billed in the effects credits, it was king kong's willis o'brien and his assistant pete peterson, that brought the behemoth to life. their paleosaurus- though in some ways reminiscent of the beast from 20,000 fathoms-is nonetheless a unique creation, with its long neck and legs giving it a stature that makes it tower over most of its surroundings. the skin of the model is finely detailed, with hundreds of minute scales, while the back has a single row of serrated plates, a very realistic model in spite of the movie's low-budget pedigree. the animation, mostly created by peterson while in a wheelchair due to his advanced multiple sclerosis, is superb; peterson had learned well from master craftsman o'brien, and ensured the dinosaur's movements would seem natural, even giving it something of a personality. despite peterson and o'brien's expertise, the film does have some technical flaws (the stiff, live-action prop head that rams the ferryboat is regrettable) but effective stop-motion scenes counterbalance these missteps. in an atmospheric night scene reminiscent of beast from 20,000 fathoms, the behemoth, in silhouette, wanders into some power lines, reacting first with shock, then anger as it attacks the high-tension towers. in the first stop-motion scene of the monster rising from the thames, the behemoth strides towards the camera, attacks some dockside cranes, and continues forward, eventually passing over the camera- a trademark of o'brien's visual style. sadly, this was also the last film that highlighted his stop-motion work. this makes the movie significant for historians, and a must for buffs. another aspect of behemoth that makes it compare favorably to most of its contemporaries at the time was the direction by eugene lourie, and the elegant, understated performances. lourie (who had previously directed beast from 20,000 fathoms) attempted to repeat that success with behemoth, this time not only directing, but screenwriting as well. however, budgetary restrictions forced lourie to keep the monster off-screen for a longer time. instead of shots of the monster actually attacking ships and structures (as ray harryhausen had done in beast) lourie substituted after-the-fact sequences (such as a beached steamship). not until the creature has actually entered london is the viewer allowed a good look at it. however, it's to lourie's credit that he eschewed the non-essential romantic subplot typical of most 50's b-movies. as the film was an anglo-american production, he made the story into an english mystery of sorts, similar to the dr. quartermass films. we know from the start that something radioactive is killing fish and men off the coast of england, but it's up to the lead characters to solve the riddle of the source of the radioactivity. in the opening of the film, an american biologist, steven karnes (played by gene evans) is lecturing a group of scientists about the dangers of not only nuclear weapons testing, but the disposal of radioactive wastes- a warning still timely 45 years later! evans plays his role straight and understated- he's the hero, yet does not let his character exceed what would be expected of a scientist investigating an unusual phenomenon. likewise, his british counterpart, prof. bickford (andre morrell) also plays low-key. evans even allows karnes to undergo a subtle change in his behavior. in the beginning of the movie, karnes's blunt, direct (american) attitude puts off the reserved bickford and other english authorities. eventually, karnes begins to adopt a more diplomatic manner, ultimately suggesting rather than demanding that a torpedo be the ideal means of destroying the behemoth. by treating the film as a detective thriller, lourie managed to keep it moving, involving the cast in various bits of business that hold the audience even when the animal does not appear. once the behemoth surfaces, however, the film exchanges mystery for spectacle, even if on a smaller scale than beast or gorgo, lourie's 3rd (and most spectacular) monster on the loose epic. the only real letdown (other than the prop head) is the demise of the creature. unlike beast, with its spectacular finale- as the monster reared up before a burning roller coaster and finally expired- (a nice harryhausen touch) the behemoth is simply struck and blown up by the torpedo. instead of a stop-motion shot of the monster dead or mortally wounded, the unrealistic prop head briefly rises for a final time before plunging into the depths of an obvious studio tank. o'brien and peterson probably did not have time to film the creature's destruction in a more dramatic fashion, although they were certainly capable of wringing pathos out of their creations. the musical score, by edwin ashley, while not as bold as david buttloph's for beast, still provides both low key tension during non-monster sequences and dramatic enhancement during the monster's rampage. ashley's work here was likely influenced by passages from stravinsky's rite of spring; it has a primitive, visceral power. those who like their dinosaur thrills high tech (cgi) may find behemoth dated, but for those who admire old-fashioned craftsmanship, and for fans of this unique genre, i recommend taking a look at this minor classic.\",\n"," \"whoops i forgot my 3d glasses to experience those mind-popping images (where we are informed when to put them on or take them off), but i doubt that gimmick would have saved this already below-average, if bizarre supernatural/slasher tale from hong

brushes by wai-keung lau's frenetic direction and an imposingly eerie setting (an abandoned theme park, which has some freaky looking clown dolls on a hanging tree) with some sensational art direction (like the opening entrance of the clown face). too bad that it's senselessly penned with an messy same-old, same old structure (even though the concept showed more promise than your copy-and-paste 'ringu' clone) of cheap jolts, typical thrills (that steals its thunder from other films) and lazily constructed characters. even throughout it demonstrates some unwelcoming camp qualities, where the witless script and self-knowing humour just do not come off. it irritated, but not as much as the performances do. bobo chan in the lead role never convinces and her screaming/crying gave me a splitting headache. yen along with her friends are looking for her missing brother, despite the warning from her medium mother that he's dead. it leads them to an amusement park, which closed down over a decade ago after a horrible accident involving the death of a young girl. instead of finding her brother they come across restless spirits who pick them off one by one. the computer effects are well-done and never distracting, as there's one memorable decapitation sequence that's brilliantly executed and there's a little bit of blood 'n'gore in the traditional style. sound effects hold an atmospheric grip, but those constant whooshing noises and whispering voices could have been toned down. the music score was not all that effective, even with some jaded cues. pretty much like a foreseeable, underwhelming haunted house theme park ride.\",\n"," \"they do not make them like these anymore - and i am really glad they do not. i was truly shocked at how bad this is. i expected at

3rd-year french classes always enjoyed this film very much. in a multi-cultural, inner-city high school, the film provided many subjects for discussion (in french in class, but i know a lot of

one of the \"sexiest\" scenes i had ever seen in a movie. one year, a 17-year-old african-american shouted, \"yes!\" when he figured out the scene: the one where protée is helping aimée lace up her evening dress, all the while both are examining the reflection of the other in the mirror. directors use the \"mirror technique\" when then want to focus on the inner conflict on the part of one or more character in a scene: this is a perfect example of the technique, and it is \"sexy\". most students had trouble understanding the end of the film. one suggested that one theme of the movie was

he must have studied autistic/mentally challenged people to pull this performance off. i also want to mention how good michele pfeiffer was in this. her character starts out as a hard-hearted witch and ends up being very human, thanks to her exposure to sam. the change in her is gradual, subtle and fun to watch. sams friends, very well played by brad silverman, joseph rosenberg, stanley desantis and doug hutchinson are very important support characters. laura dern gives a stellar performance as randy. dakota fanning as lucy very nearly steals the show. this little actress has quite a career ahead of her, i hope! this film is delicately balanced, and has a good bit of humor interspersed with parts that will have even the most insensitive of you reaching for a tissue. the film has a sort of a sappy (and somewhat surprising) outcome, but by this time any other ending would have been pretty much unacceptable to most people. this movie blew me away and i gave it a 9.\",\n"," 'sometimes reading the user comments on imdb fills me with despair for the species. for anybody to dismiss 2001: a space odyssey as \"boring\" they must have no interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of film-making. finally i understand why most hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous - they understand their audience. thankfully, those that cannot appreciate kubrick\\'s accomplishment are still a minority. most viewers are able to see the intelligence and sheer virtuosity that went into the making of this epic. this is the film that put the science in \"science fiction\", and its depiction of space travel and mankind\\'s future remains unsurpassed to this day. it was so far ahead of its time that humanity still has not caught up. 2001 is primarily a technical film. the reason it is slow, and filled with minutae is because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology (and the past, in the awe inspiring opening scenes). the film\\'s greatest strength is in the details. remember that when this film was made, man still had not made it out to the moon... but there it is in 2001, and that\\'s just the start of the journey. to create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief - i still can not work out how some of the shots were done. the film\\'s only notable mistake was the optimism with which it predicted mankind\\'s technological (and social) development. it is our shame that the year 2001 did not look like the film 2001, not kubrick\\'s. besides the incredible special effects, camera work and set design, kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food for thought about what it means to be human, and where the human race is going. yes, the ending is weird and hard to comprehend - but that\\'s the nature of the future. kubrick and clarke have started the task of envisioning it, now it\\'s up to the audience to continue. there\\'s no neat resolution, no definitive full stop, because then the audience could stop thinking after the final reel. i know that\\'s what most audiences seem to want these days, but kubrick is not going to let us off so lightly. i am glad to see that this film is in the imdb top 100 films, and only wish that it were even higher. stanley kubrick is one of the very finest film-makers the world has known, and 2001 his finest accomplishment. 10/10.',\n"," 'i have two very major complaints regarding this film. 1. that my local rental store shelved what is very clearly a soft core porn in the \"suspense\" category.

plot - i wish to contribute more to a review than a synopsis. many reviewers went so far to give this movie their lowest rating due to violence but i really do not see it. many modern movies were worse - saving private ryan was ultimately more violent than this movie, which often relies on implied blood stains than actual brutal slayings (the murders depicted in this film were done with lead pipes, afterall). i was enthralled with both halves of the movie - the first showing john holmes as a hopeless cash hungry drug addict, and the second half showing his side as a minor conspirator in a senseless bloodbath. the movie has excellent acting, even though dylan mcdemorant looks more than a bit out of place in his biker-esque personia and goatee'ed bad boy personality. the soundtrack was

right. even in the opening scene, i predicted that the \"attack\" on the family was by some man, probably the father (because only the wife and children were attacked). sure enough, that is what happened (of course, you have to wait 79 minutes to find out for sure). and, of course, another \"evil man\" scenario. why was he evil and killing his family? because he\\'s a man, duh! as someone else stated, this movie may be scary for someone under 13 years of age, or for a movie from the 1970\\'s, but it is far from being a \\'scary\\' movie by todays standards. and, like so many other crap

most expensive short he had made up to that point. in it we see him trying to perfect the large-scale action scene that would be necessary in his full-length features, packing in all the elements that had made his previous action shorts successful. griffith uses the western format already the ideal backdrop for pure, straight-ahead action set pieces as the setting for his first epic battle. like many westerns of the 1910s, the starting point is a character from the east heading out west a device which perhaps helped ease the audience into the wilderness, and here those easterners are a pair of children, which was important for the type of picture this develops into. for griffith, you could not have action without a sense of vulnerability and here he crams it in, with the kids from back east, lillian gish as the distraught mother of \"the only baby in town\" and even some puppies that are at risk of ending up on the indians\\' menu. all this paves the way for an exceedingly complex and layered action sequence, blending the trapped heroine scenario and the ride-to-the-rescue with the battles that griffith had been depicting since his earliest civil war pictures in 1909. there is a phenomenal amount going on here, and griffith does very well at maintaining the exhilarating pace throughout and keeping everything coherent and logical. however, juggling x amount of elements in an action sequence does not necessarily make it that many times more exciting, no matter how skilfully they are balanced, and griffith did create better tension-soaked finales before and after this one. but even a griffith picture so heavily focused on action would not be without its drama, characterisation and atmospherics. in the battle at elderbrush gulch, the emotional set-up is dealt with briefly but economically. first, we have the scene in which the waifs leave their home. the cart they travel on heads away from the camera, making use of depth and distance to express their moving away from safety and civilization. an equally effective scene is the one in which we are introduced to the young family of gish, bobby harron and their baby. the people of the town coo over the precious tot, then saunter off screen, revealing that two indians were watching them from the background, adding a sinister little note of danger. of course, many viewers today have pointed out the battle at elderbrush gulch\\'s offensive portrayal of native americans (in contrast with the more sympathetic red man\\'s view), but perhaps all is not what it seems. first of all, take a look at the indian chief\\'s son\\'s waistcoat it\\'s black and covered in shiny white dots. it looks to me like a pearly king\\'s jacket, perhaps modified slightly for the warmer climate. now have a look at the \"war dance\" they perform later on it has a certain \"knees-up mother brown\" air to it. these are not indians, they are cockneys! so it should not be offensive to native americans. just cockneys.',\n"," \"indeed this film did have it's entertaining elements, but that's because i am a football fanatic. indeed, i have just contradicted myself, but it just patronizes you at every

from a restaurant up the road, whom they thought they should help because she was getting hassled by some guy she knew. what warrants that as an excuse to bring a girl into your circle of friends or their cabin? she, of course, begins planting seeds of jealousy, having the men have sex with her by feeding their dumb minds everything they want to hear. the music was an average affair (standard frantic keyboard music like in every horror film without differences). the actors seemed to be brought from some soap opera the way they complained and whined about everything. the idea that the main guy in the film takes this girl to the cabin as their first date makes for a horrible date, but of course, she unrealistically gives herself to him on the first night of getting to know him. there was hardly a budget spent of anything, it seems, but there was a clown outfit and plenty of cheap $1-store dolls lying around in the woods, which was a horribly bland place to shoot this whole movie (been done too many times). i was also waiting for the clown to jump into the house to kill the remaining 4 characters of the film (in through the glass maybe), but nothing exciting like that ever entered the film. i guess you were just supposed to like the clown being a killer or something. i had to give the film a 3. it was an interesting premise (clown as the texas chainsaw massacre character, essentially) and i\\'ll give them a star for acting serious all the way through when the movie could have totally been a b-movie-style video, but they opted for the more legitimate style of video. but

genuinely creepy and scary and contains couple of great shocks which stay in your mind. this sequel is much worse and was pretty hard to sit through when i watched it for the second time. plot includes again a dead person who leads the characters to the mysterious cemetery from the first film, and soon they decide to try that wonderful idea of getting someone dead back to life with the \"help\" of that old burial ground which has been used by indians. what follows is human and animal zombies, couple of atmospheric moments and stupid gore. in other words, pretty lame a film. at times, the film is purely ridiculous and cannot be taken seriously. but the character played by the great clancy brown (blue steel, highlander) is funny to watch and pretty effective \"dead\" man.. but i can not recommend this to anyone real horror fanatic because most of the time, this is stupid and boring. and the violence tries to be more brutal than in the first film but it fails pretty miserably. i think it is stupid to make splatter films when you have to keep the r in mind.. and horror film to be scary, effective and atmospheric, the use of effects is definitely not a must. see the first film and do not rush seeing this sequel. 3/10',\n"," \"i first remember seeing this one back in the 70s when it was shown on late night television. scared the hell out of me. but then, i was a teenager back in those days, not as jaded about films as i am now. castle of blood (aka: danse macabre) is a fine example of the 60s italian horror genre, along with mario bava's black sunday(1960), curse of the living dead (aka: kill baby kill) (1966) and mario caiano's nightmare castle (1965). if you want spooky atmosphere along with great writing, then check these out as well. i also rate these along with those early poe films that roger corman was doing during the same period. i saw the new synapse dvd that was taken from a french print and it's a great improvement over that old pan-and-scan print that was making the rounds on television over the years. it adds a couple of minutes of dialog (in french) that do not really add much to the movie as whole, but it's nice to see it complete, without cuts. unfortunately the dvd does not really offer any extras beyond stills from the film. one flub i noticed was in the opening scene, seeing the smoke-effects man next to the camera being reflected on the glass of the inn's front door. i guess the editors did not catch it at the time, or maybe they did not care, but it is something i did not notice the first time. that's the wonders of dvd. you get to see all the flubs, mistakes and details that were not apparent the first time around. but no matter. but no matter, it still gets a 7 on the imdb meter\",\n"," 'this show

kingpin hardly eases up there is constant action going on on screen. this show was made to be aired on cable for the drug and violent content and i do believe this show could of beat out the sopranos if it was made into a regular t.v. series and if it was not so restricted on content, overall if you like the sopranos then you are more than likely love kingpin and even if you do not like the

but i think there was only one scene with zombies even in it. their make up looked as if it were applied by an 8 year old girl. the scene was totally random and out of place and featured one of the characters fighting the zombies off with a hedge trimmer (i am not kidding) but they used chainsaw sound effects. this was undoubtedly the poorest movie i have ever seen in my life. the only circumstance that i would not totally ridicule every person responsible for production of this film is if i learned that it was produced entirely by 11 year old's. really though, even with all of the

i was bothered that the time travel device that drives this plot is never explained, except that we know russell himself initiates it as a 70 year old. also, why does his dying mother have to come to school to get him when he wins the fight; why, if as his older self says, he has to fight that kid again and again for the next few years does his mother not have to come and get him every time, and

the unhappiness from north american people satisfied.the ones who are already convinced do not need any more; and the ones which match with the aggressive foreign policy from the united states will not stop supporting the \"pro-america\" practices.however, that has not stopped many filmmakers from looking for new material; in other words, they are more interested to focus on the peripheral aspects of war, instead than focusing on the war itself. so, we have seen movies like in the valley of elah and stop loss, which offer discouraging visions of the soldiers who came back from war; movies like lions for lambs, rendition and syriana, which examine the ideology behind the conflicts; and finally, movies which could belong to the action genre if it was not because of their political message, like the kingdom and body of lies.but we had never seen the conflict from the enemy\\'s point of view, and because of that, traitor is a refreshing and fascinating portrait of the causes which motivate the rebellion and disgust against the north american expansion. the screenplay from this movie has unsuspected levels of intellectual and emotional provocation.screenwriters jeffrey nachmanoff (who is also the director from this movie) and steve martin (the famous comedian) refuse to bring us easy answers about the ideological conflicts, and they portrait a discouraging vision of international politic, where concepts like \"loyalty\" and \"treason\" are neither good or bad, but only useful tools for manipulating opinions, public perception or legislation. traitor is a truly audacious movie which goes more far away from the easy complaints of patriotism and human rights which other movies make, showing us that in fact, the world works on a grey scale, and not on the simplistic \"black and white\" the politicians want to make us believe. but, besides of all the ideological background from this film, traitor work perfectly as an ambiguous and incredibly tense thriller, which has perfectly developed characters who occupy their ambiguous positions without revealing their clear porpoises, provoking a delicious suspense on the spectator, at the same time it is difficult to know where the story will take us.nachmanoff\\'s direction is sober, something which works very well on the context from this movie.the performances are excellent, not only the one from the great don cheadle, but also the ones from the supporting cast, where the members who mostly stand out are saïd taghmaoui as a terrorist and jeff daniels as a security contractor, which is a role where this underrated actor shows his wide range, which goes more far away than the family films where we usually see him.the only fail i found on this movie is that the ending could have been a little more polished.but, in spite of that, i recommend traitor with a lot of enthusiasm, because it is an excellent movie which does not only entertain very much, but which also leaves the spectator

howard(.. the late david graf, tackleberry of police academy fame)is actually the mastermind behind the whole ordeal. lillian and her slimy uncle francis(greg lewis)were left her father\\'s company fortune, a plumbing business, and howard, the one who actually built it into a great success, wants the royalties. so mike and david must fight off a vast number of scumbags using their martial arts skills(.. and handguns at their disposal, when necessary) in order to do so. when i was a teenager, my stepfather used to rent these bad action flicks all the time, and i would sneak into his room and snatch them while he was gone to work, watching them. most of the story-lines resembled each other and were recycled all the time. normally you\\'d have a team(.. a duo or trio)of cops, equipped with superior fighting skills, often engaged in hand-to-hand combat or exchanging gunfire with drug-runners or dirty, underhanded criminal lowlifes of some sort. while the criminals had automatic weapons which could fire off an endless supply of ammunition, they could not hit their desired targets while the heroes, with only handguns, could shoot a few bullets and down the opposition almost immediately. in physical battles the heroes could be outnumbered five to one and wipe them out with ease. yet, no matter how ridiculous these scenarios are, i could not help but enjoy them. the heroes, including our duo in \"american kickboxer 2\", are not chosen for their acting abilities or skills at \"emoting\", but were hired for either the way they look on screen or fighting capabilities. i had forgotten about kathy shower, quite a looker in her heyday, often a fixture in softcore cinemax erotica during the 90s. she is the young woman who is the center of the three main male characters in the film. the villains are basically stuntmen who walk on screen to fire their guns, getting shot on cue or receiving their customary ass whippings. plenty of squibs are used as henchmen become bullet fodder. when you enter an early 90\\'s movie, often an action product of the direct-to-video market, you should not expect a stirring emotional story-line or complex characterizations featuring multi-faceted performances.. because you will be ultimately disappointed. yet, if you surrender to the mind-numbing ineptitude of these derivative, oh-so familiar action plots, then maybe \"american kickboxer 2\" might provide you with a bit of forgettable entertainment to waste away 90 minutes. as expected, we get the usual female throwaway dropping by to show off her breasts near the beginning of the movie, a student of martial artist david, showing how it\\'s important to be buff, with fighting skills, if you want arm candy or to get laid. like a great many

(it feels as if, with an eagle eye, you might see some villagers off to torch dr. frankenstein in the background.) techniques change. tastes change. so i will not go off on how crazy it seems that this film was so acclaimed in its day. but it\\'s not one of the classics that hold up -- more just \"fair warning\" about the kind of over-simplified malarkey to which ford was going to devote his career.',\n"," 'i have seen a handful of unusual comedies from japan and the most recent one being the calamari wrestler followed by cromartie high school which also featured two well known wrestlers; takayama and hashimoto (rip), playing complete opposites of their fighting characters of course, but in a script that would make the power rangers\\' screen writers shake their heads in disbelief. the film opens with the purposely lengthy lesson of the school\\'s chaotic legacy. the school in the present time looked like a strong candidate for the battle royale competition (which i thought the film would eventually rib, but never did). the main character, a composed young man decides to enroll despite possessing higher education, but soon regrets after his not-too-bright friend flunks the \\'subtraction exam\\'. some promising sidekicks get introduced, including takayama\\'s character who hates all types of transportation and decides to help the hijackers of a plane just so they would not fly. the film showed much potential, but sidetracked twenty minutes in after shelving these winning characters and spending way too much time with the intros of the gorillas and the \"hard gay\" man who ended up offering very little throughout the film. and where the hell were the freddie mercury impersonations? yes the film needed such off the map characters (like the depressed pootans), that was a given, but it failed to realize what direction to go with and what characters/situations to stick with in its full feature form. a perfect example of film-making where it seemed like the direction had no working script, just sketchy gags thought out by the crew late at night. simply putting a blonde wig on an evil alien ape and calling the duo, gori and lla was not enough to tickle my funny bone. spoofing of the exorcist with a possessed robot, revealed to have only been infested with a cat was just a wasted, lazy attempt at parody. again, i was not looking for sensible comedy or in-depth characters here, but even as a sleazy, low budget com-oddity, this film failed to keep me laughing and to exceed the wacky goods and true characteristics of the anime show. but, if you find these types of films irresistible and are a die hard fan of the show then i guess you\\'ll watch and enjoy this movie regardless, as it was mainly aimed at its fan-base.',\n"," 'the great news is that this film is now available on dvd from http://treasureflix.com for all those who wish to own it as well as on video.this is good news as it is one of my favourite films! i watched this film for the first time in the 80s and it is compulsory holiday viewing. living in the small market town called tewkesbury, picturesque and with its own traditions,of reenactments,and traditions we are also a cosy tight community. we are now also faced with large housing developments which threaten to destroy the community and you can see why i love this film first of all-and most important, there are lashings of snow! then there is the lovely legend of the christmas tree and also the christian denouement as all the community cough up the money to help the destitute farmer save his farm and stay in the community. the evil developers-only after the money are sent packing as the whole town pledge their money to help protect what they have , which is very special. i love the way the whole community send their message to santa via the post office which is misunderstood by the hero. he and his daughter have a long journey to make after the death of the wife and mother of the family. (there is a likely candidate for this)-even a sleigh ride and most heartwarming of all is that the taxi driver, whose engine is broken is mysteriously given a new one on christmas morning and no-one had engineered it! there is a lovely moment where denver sings a lullaby and an exciting search. great gentle film for everything christmas is really about.',\n"," 'this story of \\'tea\\' and \\'tomatoes\\' purports to boast an \\'all star hollywood cast\\', but even if you are a follower of films from the 1930\\'s and \\'40\\'s, i do not think you\\'ll recognize a single name in the credits. maybe lyle talbot, who\\'s screen credits total nearly three hundred roles, but after that i think you\\'d be hard pressed to recognize another actor in the picture. except for jack elam in one of his very first screen roles; he actually was a rather good looking guy back then. that might have been the single treat in the film for me. it\\'s curious how all of these exploitation films wind up with a handful of different titles. i saw this picture under the name \"she shoulda\\' said no\", and just like the classic cult film \"reefer madness\", it tells the story of youth run wild after falling victim to the evil terrors of marihuna (sometimes spelled marijuana as a closing segment informs us). it\\'s hard to take seriously today of course, and i really wish there were some folks around from the era who could tell us first hand how these flicks were received back in the day. i have to say, i was really distracted by alan baxter\\'s portrayal of the local pusher markey. he\\'s a dead ringer for a young jack nicholson, and if i did not know better, i would have been checking the credits to see if it was him or not. another weird thing was the use of that eerie sci-fi/twilight zone type music whenever folks on screen were shown puffing on the dreaded weed. you know, i had to laugh when i saw the \"i am gonna die\\' guy under the influence. it reminded me of the very first and just about only time i tried pot myself. it was in an apartment that lost it\\'s heat in the winter, and my best friend was convinced he was going to freeze to death. i was not as hysterical as rita and her friends, but i thought it was all pretty funny at the time. i had a curious thought about mid-way through the picture. would not it be great if the coen brothers took the idea of these exploitation flicks and made one of their own? you could really get some mileage out of characters portrayed by john tuturro, jon polito, and steve buscemi. jack nicholson might be a little too old for this sort of stuff, but i think a cameo would be just the right touch. i think he would be up for it.',\n"," 'while the united states and japan duke it out during world war ii, doctors otto kruger (as jan), elissa landi (as royce), and donald woods (as michael) must sort out their \"love triangle.\" on the strategically located philippine island of \"corregidor\", the good doctors get to see some of the war action. stock footage is flown in. of course, ms. landi, being a \"lady doctor\", is protected from viewing \"mutilated\" corpses. right. although it is not enough to recommend the film, rick vallin (as pinky mason) and wanda mckay (as hey dutch) are relatively entertaining. \"dedicated to the united states and philippine armed services\"',\n"," \"even without mystery science theater this one would still be full of laughs. it starts with a professor of some sort explaining all this theories of what is in the center of the earth, and boy are they not even close to the truth. then you meet the troops as john agar and the beaver's dad and the rest of the team are doing research on artifacts. they find something that prompts them to climb the mountain and then one of the men falls down a hole so you get to watch men climbing down a hole for a good ten minutes. then they get trapped and stumble upon an ancient civilization underground ruled by white elves in dumb costumes. of course the logic in this movie is a bit suspect as the men probably did not go down more than a hundred feet and they were on a mountain so i doubt the place could have been as big as made out to be. the mole people look especially stupid, but at least there clothes look more normal than the elves. and the one seen where the elf people are whipping the mole men does sort of make you wanna sing that old devo song. and watch for the old man who does nothing, but slow agar and the beaver's dad down with his constant whinning.\",\n"," \"now that's it's 2008, who really has a care in the world about a guy like db sweeney, even back then he was not a big deal. two tickets to paradise is an outlined story that's well and true where three friends hit the road under each of their personal circumstances. again, a proved plot. the problem with this film, other than it's 'so bad it's compelling' title, is the script. cliché after cliché three guys do the same things you have seen in every other road movie... and blow up vanna white's house. john c. mcginley's acting job is superb, especially compared to that of the late db sweeney's. (his career is dead, hence the late. though i hear he's moving to tv, good for him). also, john c likely has the least awful character in the film. the score is so generic it actually feels like you are watching a third rate film from 1993, or jeff anderson's movie now you know (also set me back a few years, but at least that was more entertaining.) i mean, yah, i guess i enjoyed parts of it. but, the nerdy guy is annoying, db tries to be this cool failed guitar player (with some rough influences, like some of the worst of classic rock) who has some strange relationship with a stripper, and john c is a gambler who's wife and kid leave him after the death of his father as well as a visit from one of his bookie's henchmen. i keep thinking up ways to make this movie better. but i think

poor investment for any serious movie fan. the story is very hard to follow and poorly constructed with shallow characters. the story is not terribly easy to grasp for the average person in my opinion and not presented to the audience clearly enough-nor well enough to garner much interest and/or curiosity. fonda appears bored, while still trying to appear smart and glamorous, in her role. kris kristofferson is simply a case of very bad casting. despite some efforts to make him physically appear like a big-time banker, he comes off flat and stiff in his role. whether talking down a bank president or talking fonda into bed, all his lines are delivered in a blank monotone style that conveys nothing. we also are never given much background or motivation for the events and doings of the people wandering about this epic of high finance. fonda and kristofferson\\'s first meeting is not much of an icebreaker, yet the two are bedding down together by their second or third encounter. the film is directed by alan j. pakula and it looks much like other works for him. secret meetings in parking lots and suspect late night boardroom conferences may appear to be the things that make up a good thriller, but here they are simply padding between the great nothingness that amounts to two-hours of dull slow paced cliche filled dialog from weak characters that you never grow to care much about. the movie\\'s heavy-handed and overly-dramatic musical score makes many scenes nearly laughable. there\\'s little to recommended beyond those morbidly curious to see a bad movie, which is why i

it\\'s hard to know where exactly to begin in compiling a list of its shortcomings. to start with, there\\'s something inherently self-defeating and pointless in constructing a narrative from two widely conflicting viewpoints - a la \"rashomon\" - when one of the supposed eyewitnesses is already dead and, thus, unable to personally relate his side of the story. how does it enhance the verisimilitude of the tale if most of our information has to come filtered down to us through a secondhand source, a person who was not even present at the events he\\'s describing - unless, of course, he was hiding in a nearby closet during all those \"intimate\" moments he is able to recount in such juicy and exhaustive detail? either that or the murder victim was one of the chattiest, kiss-and-tell gossips in the history of the movies. and why does it take till the closing reels for the supposedly intelligent professional investigators to smell a rat in that setup? eventually, the twist-and-turn plotting leads to so much incoherence and confusion that you might well wonder if the filmmakers themselves understood what it was they were doing. beyond the clumsy, inscrutable storytelling, \"slow burn\" also suffers from some of the most overripe dialogue this side of \"the black dahlia.\" with such knee-slapping howlers as \"she stood there like a tangerine, ripe and ready to be peeled\" and \"she walked in smelling like mashed potatoes and every guy within thirty feet wanted to be the gravy,\" the script could easily win first prize in a bad film noir writing

every now and again if it does not take itself too seriously (die hard), but too often submerges any substance and truth to the situation by trying to please the popcorn-munching audience members too eagerly. such ventures into the often complex and extremely conflicted area of politics, war and current social prejudices are subsequently left alone by those the film ostensibly tries to draw in (those looking for intelligent, insightful political drama) and instead adopted and loved by people riveted by your average michael bay movie. it's just about safe to say that those movies have their place, as most movies do, but that when you start mixing real-life affairsand especially those linked to such acts as terrorism and religionyou begin unravelling something that really should be left alone if you are not going to deal with it in a dignified manner. traitor, which comes from director jeffrey nachemanoff (known for his script the day after tomorrow), certainly does not shy away from this sense of action that permeates the average political action thriller, but it is not ruled or dominated by it either. instead the movie exists as a tightly wound, exciting experience, but one that draws far more of its compelling moments from elements grounded in reality through both ethical discussion and the characters that drive the thing forward. the usual twists and turns in narrative are here (so much so that i am consciously going to avoid giving any form of a synopsis for the sake of preserving vital turning points), but they refuse to submit to banal contrivances and absurd mystery tangents that take far too long to reveal themselves. rather, nachemanoff fools the viewer many times and keeps them guessing as to where all of this is going, yet never neglects them to being mere witnesses to a bunch of calloused details and bullets flying around the screen. the script is well paced and focused, with plenty of time-out segments that develop character and plot significantly, with little excess. one could argue that perhaps traitor is a little too long for it's own good; there are moments where the movie slows down to snail's pace for the sake of filling in plot holes and making sure the viewer is up to speed with what is going on, but such instances never become overbearing, nor do they drown out any tension developed up until that point. yet without these points, traitor would not be quite the experience it is, mainly because a lot of the movie's ability to draw you in through its central characters, their moral dilemmas involving what they feel they have to do, and the repercussions of such actions. by tackling such detailed issues head-on, nachemanoff makes sure to avoid the pitfalls of your common political thriller; the decisions presented here are presented exactly as such; there are consequences, there are doubts and there are conflicts inside and outside said people that manifest throughout and permeate the entire feature; traitor dances with the people behind the fbi suits and the skull-caps, and it makes sure that they are not mere action-movie caricatures for the sake of preserving its ultimate drawing pointreality. of course, a large portion of the movie's ability to suspend disbelief is through the performances of the central cast who embody their characters with a convincing sense of realism throughout. here, nobody is safe, and a few important characters bite the bullet, yet often they will come and go without melodramatic excess, imbued with a dramatic but grounded temperament. while i could go on about each of the actors' performances here, it must be stated that the key portrayal comes from lead man don cheadle who reminds us once more of the talent he has for nuanced subtlety that he so obviously possesses. in the end however, it's this consistency in grit and cerebrally engaging tone that makes traitor a far greater whole than the sum of its parts. by no means is it a perfect motion picture; as a movie it lacks an immediately definable structure that meanders from time to time, and the eventual conclusion does feel a little half-baked, but for the most part, nachemanoff does well to craft an intelligent and subdued take on a genre too often obsessed with gung-ho escapades and mawkish sentiments. - a review by jamie robert ward (http://ww.invocus.net)\",\n"," \"this is truly one of the

\"admittedly, i tuned into this in the hopes of seeing some beefcake shots of james brolin. unfortunately, there was only one, early on, and the rest of the movie was very tame, and ultimately made little sense. the story, what there is of it, centers on nick and julie atkins, a couple whose marriage of many years is beginning to grow stale. nick, a successful businessman is focused on work to the point of neglecting julie, who tries to fill the void by going back to school. julie's longing for the passion that she and nick had early in their marriage begins to take shape in the form of powerful sexual fantasies which block out reality for minutes at a time, causing her to do things like burning breakfast and misplace her husband's papers. at first she fantasizes about her husband, but as the movie progresses, she begins to fantasize about other men, and about encounters with random strangers whom she meets. this culminates in her acting out her fantasies with disastrous consequences for her marriage. can she and her husband rebuild their relationship? is it worth saving? this could have been an interesting premise, but the execution is so bland that you wonder why they even bothered. characters are not developed. motives are not explained. background information is not given. no exploration is made of how julie got to the point where she could not control herself, and no explanation is offered as to how she will do so in the future. the end product is a muddled mess which is just as confusing as julie's fantasies, which are surprisingly underdeveloped. the acting is a mixed bag. donna mills as julie does well with the material she is given, although her continual self pity does become strident after awhile. james brolin acts as though he is reading his lines from cue cards, and even his anger over his wife's infidelity is hard to buy into, he shows so little passion over the whole issue. the supporting roles are mostly forgettable. disappointing

the movie was that it felt like you were in the ancient egypt. here it feels like they are running around fighting aliens in a canadian forrest. and it's so lame that appaerantly, on other planets, the fall comes as well. you can see leaves on the ground in the forrests that all look like forrests outside vancouver. it just makes the show even more unbelievable and dumb. and then there is

russel. and russells way of playing o neill, well he was much more cynical. andersons o neil, is way too soft. i liked it that russels version just did'nt give a s** and had no trouble detonating the bomb until the very end of the movie. michael shanks does a really good job as jackson though taking over from james spader. teal'c is a really annoying character. he is jaffa. not a jaffa. just jaffa. aarrgh! a former bodyguard of a pathetic ra character, seen only in the pilot and in one other episode so far. teal'c speaks talks and acts like a robot. i have seen better acting from jean claude van damme. and the fact that teal'c and the ra character and the people they saved in the movie, can speak english all of a sudden is also incredibly dumb. what made the aliens so scary in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters. as for the special effects, they are really good in the pilot. but the very rare effects in the actual show are badly done and looks cheap. especially a planet they visit with crystals. it's so obvious they walk around on a soundstage with a badly made painting in the background. it's an insult to us viewers that they made it look so cheap. especially when they could have made it in front of a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds. the x-files had better effects when they aired their first episodes in 1993. that was 4 years before sg-1 started. and they did'nt have the apparent two million dollar budget per episode, that sg-1 supposedly had. they must have spend all the money on catering. because i do not see it on the screen. incredibly boring and pointless show, that could have been great if they had shot the show in hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters.\",\n"," \"fantastic, madonna at her finest, the film is funny and her acting is brilliant. it may have been made in the 80's but it has all the qualities of a modern hollywood block-buster. i love this film and i think its totally unique and will cheer up any droopy person within a matter of minutes. fantastic.\",\n"," \"there are only two even half-good reasons to watch this limp, atypical version of the frankenstein story. and both of them can be found inside just kate o'mara's blouse. it's rubbish, pure and simple, all the more surprisingly so considering a) it was written and directed by jimmy sangster, one of the half dozen most important names in the history of hammer films; and b) it has an absolutely top-notch cast: as well as ralph bates (who hammer were grooming to take over peter cushing's mantle; never happened) we get uber-hammer babe veronica carlson, the aforementioned miss o'mara as gorgeous, pouting and shapely a starlet as ever graced a hammer flick (she can not act for toffee, but who cares?) the criminally underrated and underused jon finch, and the brilliant dennis price. sangster's screenplay is weak. it tries hard to be funny, but succeeds only in being puerile. and his direction is workmanlike at best. there is little real action, certainly not the sort of action you expect from a hammer frankenstein movie. the gore quotient is minimal, and the naked bazooka count zero odd, considering female nudity was hammer's big usp in the early 70s, and sangster's only other directorial effort for hammer, lust for a vampire, was replete with a multitude of heaving bosoms. (apparently kate o'mara refused to appear topless, which makes you wonder how she got the part in the first place, but never mind.) most of the diy brain surgery takes place off screen, and the monster, played by muscleman and soon-to-be darth vader david prowse, is about as frightening as an ice cream cone. he's supposedly been stitched together in the usual way, from assorted local unfortunates, but for some reason he has the body of a greek god. the only concession to his patchwork creation is stitching scars that look like they have been drawn on with lipstick. the plot is not worth outlining sangster clearly did not spend much time on it, so neither will i and there are some annoyingly stupid bits of business which mean that the film does not work, even on its own jokey level. (for example, the monster is not strong enough to pull his shackles out of the wall, but he makes matchwood out of a solid oak door.) unless you are a hammer completist i'd give this one a miss. if it does happen to come your way, as it did mine, on satellite tv late one night, try and stay awake for kate o'mara's appearance in a see-through nightie, then switch off. (she gets killed off soon after anyway. probably died of shame.)\",\n"," \"i can not say too much about kalifornia as sadly i have yet to actually see the whole thing (i have only managed to see it in bits and pieces on fuse.) but what i have seen is absolutely awesome! i am a fan of brad pitt but i admit not all his earlier movies are well good. but this role, i just, his acting is great, his character early seems so normal well okay creepy, dark weird but you know normal for a hillbilly of that type i guess. and juliette lewis's performance although i can see how some may be annoyed by it i think it's amazing. sadly i have yet to see the end, but from reading other reviews on here it sounds good, but disappointing. i have to admit that i wish david duchovany's (sorry if the spelling on that is incorrect) was a bit flat but for him it was okay. his wife's character was better, and i thought her performance while not the best in the movie was pretty good, a portrait of the avant-gard/older sister type. particularly the scene where early and brian go to play pool, and adele and carrie are having their one on one time together. i have watched that scene at least twice now and i still think the acting in it is just wonderful. one because of the emotion that adele portrays after talking about being raped by the three guys and how she feels about early and carrie's reaction to it. everything about that i think is just so perfect. i mean, maybe it's because i can relate a bit, i am not sure. as for brad pitt who plays the serial killer that we actually get to see for once; i thought he was great. some movies with pitt that i have seen were just average or not worth seeing. i do not think i have ever seen a terrible pitt movie or if i have it's not because of his acting it's other factors. this movie was not one of them. he turned out a great performance in kalifornia. i swear i am not just some random i do like him for his acting not just because he's good looking, i mean his character in this movie is not exactly handsome or cute by any means! pitt is dark, brooding and downright scary at times. yet he's also cheerful, funny, nice, and even loving towards adele. granted there are some spots that made me want to reach through the tv and strangle him but that's probably just me (and the character pitt played in the movie.) but it also shows how good pitt's acting was in this movie it made me forget that he was playing a character, that is what good acting is supposed to do. at any rate i wish i could say more, but that's all i can really say without having seen the ending, i have seen most of the movie through what i have caught on fuse and as i am writing this i am taping it on dvr so hopefully i can write a more complete review later. i just wanted to share my thoughts on a movie that i thought was something really cool and something that seems to have gotten overlooked (it should not have!)\",\n"," \"i rented this movie last week. i saw kevin spacey and morgan freeman were on it, so it seemed promising. and it was, until justin timberlake came on scene. he is a really bad actor and should not be allowed to make a movie ever again. i mean, he is one of the most boring, uninspired actors i have ever seen. he puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever. why the hell was he cast for the role of josh pollack? i think matt damon would have been a better choice. kevin spacey was another big disappointment. his character is so dull, it seems like a bad mix of his character in american beauty and john doe in se7en. it might sound cool, but believe me, it's not. now, dylan mcdermott's acting is very good. it's about one of the very few good things about this movie. he is just inspired. morgan freeman is good but nothing special. he has some really cool lines though. about the story, although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good. i was expecting a big twist when lazerov (dylan mcdermott) was killed, but nothing really happened.\",\n"," \"this is an extremely good film - highly recommended. it will not be to everyone's taste, but if you are not afraid of thinking during a film then you should find plenty to take away from this one. bad guy is a film based on the central premise of a relationship built between what is effectively a hostage-taker and his hostage. what transpires is a stream of abuses, power-shifts, emotional turmoil, love, hate, violence, sex, and almost every other aspect of life. this is an extremely original story, well told, with fascinating characters that are extremely human... both the good and bad sides of humanity. the production values are very high, great acting, direction, cinematography, script, music, everything is top notch. typically, korean films are very much based in real characters, social issues, and have an earthy approach that humanises their films beyond those of most countries. bad guy is no exception... while it is violent, confrontational, and decidedly dark, it bristles with underlying emotion and shows life without the rose coloured glasses. the characters are at times extremely emotional, and at others almost entirely emotionally void as they struggle constantly to keep their balance in circumstances that are spiraling around them. this is not an 'easy' film, in that it does not hand feed the viewer, there are no 'jaws' style music queues to let you know when to be scared. you will need to work out how to feel for yourself with this one, which is fairly rare in this day and age. as said earlier, this movie is not for everyone, however if the concept sounds like something that interests you, then you should enjoy this film. if on the other hand you do not like the idea of watching a film based on the idea of a man forcing a woman into a life of sexual servitude, then stay well away from this film.\",\n"," 'this has become one of my favorite movies and certainly one of the best westerns i have ever seen. having a soft spot for the genre (westerns are or were, since they are no longer made very often morality plays that too often have been denigrated by critics with intellectual pretensions), i purchased the dvd, sight unseen, because i had read enough about william s. hart\\'s work (much of which he wrote and directed) to pique my interest and thought i should have at least one of his films in my video collection. i must admit that i approached the actual viewing with some trepidation. my previous experiences with silent cinema \"classics\" had left me feeling let down. chaney\\'s the phantom of the opera, griffith\\'s birth of a nation and fairbanks\\' the mark of zorro were fine, but not nearly as good as their reputations would lead one to expect. they were either too long, or too theatrical, or both. the toll gate, however, emerged as a pleasant surprise. it is a story told in a simple and straightforward manner. black deering (played by hart), leader of a notoriously successful outlaw gang, thinks the time has come for group to disband, before its luck runs out. he is, however, opposed by his chief lieutenant, jordan, who goads them all into one last holdup by promising great wealth but leads them into a trap in which he is complicit. everyone is killed except deering, who is taken prisoner. when his captors recognize him as the man who once saved a number of soldiers and settlers by warning an outpost of an impending indian attack, they allow him to escape. free, he tries to find honest work but is snubbed and ridiculed and ultimately must rob again to survive. soon, he is pursued not only by the sheriff\\'s posse but also by jordan (now prospering from the reward money he has collected) and his henchmen. his flight leads him to a remote cabin inhabited by a single mother and her little son. after some initial misgivings, they take him into their hearts. deering sees a chance for a new life but, with the posse and jordan closing in, realizes that this may not be possible. hart was the first great western star and the first to inject realism into the genre. as one of the pioneers of movie-making, he created many of the characters and situations that have become cliché in westerns for more than ninety years. what keeps his movies interesting, however, was his ability to go beyond the cliché (perhaps his imitators did not go far enough) so that the material appears fresh and innovative, even now. three such instances in the toll gate illustrate this: 1) in one scene, his character shoots into a crowd in an attempt to kill jordan, and kills a bystander instead. a subsequent close-up shows that he is clearly frustrated. the frustration, however, comes not from the fact that he has gunned down a man who had hitherto caused him no harm but that he missed his intended target. 2) in another, as he flees from the posse, his \"borrowed\" horse steps into a gopher hole and breaks a leg. hart pulls out his gun to put the animal out of its misery but, before pulling the trigger, gives his head a sad, loving pat, as if to say farewell to an old friend. 3) and finally, after he has strangled jordan and thrown his body over a cliff, he returns to retrieve his guns and spots his adversary\\'s pistol lying on the ground nearby. he steps forward and gives it a swift kick before mounting his horse. it is a simple gesture but it underscores the deep loathing he feels for the man who betrayed him and his comrades. and i love the title, the toll gate. it is allegorical in its implication that a man cannot begin a new life until he has paid for the sins of his old one. deering\\'s payment comes in the form of sacrifice. today\\'s more sophisticated audiences may not buy into that sentiment entirely but it can still work on you if you let it. viewers who like their videos in pristine condition will undoubtedly object to the dvd\\'s picture quality, especially the badly deteriorated final reel. i do not mind at all. that a copy of this 1920 movie even exists at all is a miracle since prints of so many other silent movies have been lost. if you bear that in mind and look upon the film as a piece of history, its visual flaws are not that difficult to accept. william s. hart was born in 1870 in new york but grew up in the minnesota and wisconsin where he learned to speak sioux and indian sign language. he counted wyatt earp and bat masterson among his friends and collected remington paintings, so his knowledge of the west was first-hand. if his vision seems overly romanticized by today\\'s standards, it is nevertheless rooted far closer to reality than the spaghetti westerns of the \\'60s and \\'70s and the revisionist works that followed. both the star and his films are overdue for re-evaluation.',\n"," \"i have read many reviews of this movie that state that it is not good. it is a very good movie. comparing it to other movies that are not in its genre is an unfair

\"new year's day. the day after consuming a few too many vodka martinis and cosmopolitans mixed with a bunch of bubbly at midnight, my wife and i discovered the local cable company is offering up the digital specialty channels for free for the month of january. we had a choice - do we make use of the freebie channels or do we start watching the eight seasons of x-files on dvd that we received from our daughter for christmas? we elected for the digital freebie since the dvds are going nowhere and we need something like ten twelve-hour days to watch all the x-files beginning to end. the drive-in channel was offering a horror classic three movie marathon: asylum (1972), house of the damned (1996) and the pit and the pendulum (1961). asylum is well-reviewed here and the pit and the pendulum was on too late for us to watch which meant we could really only be properly critical for house of the damned. to be honest, we tried to be serious about the movie since its stars have reasonably good acting credentials - greg evigan (william shatner's over-written tekwars) and alexandra paul (the only baywatch babe who could act although she has the body of a ten-year-old boy). unfortunately, we soon dissolved to giggles, under the influence of a little hair-of-the-dog, as we each shouted out the names of movies from which this dog borrowed its scenes: poltergeist, the shining, hell house, house on haunted hill, ghost busters! the acting, especially by evigan's real-life daughter, was not too bad considering the silly script they had to work with. the cgi, for 1996, was hilarious - at its worst point in the final scene when it should have been the most horrific it was so bad my wife and i dissolved in laughter. overall: acting 4/5, script 2/5, sfx 0/5\",\n"," \"yes, it's a strange

frost was jim carrey in a gore movie but i liked his faust part of the role. the psychiatrist character and actress are the most defined and well worked ones. the fx were right (wonderful make-up, specially the van campen-turns-into-desirewoman one: horny at the beginning and more disturbing as it went on). but the mix of bad acting, spawn-theft plot and bad worked scenes and connections did not leave me clear one thing: did i like this movie? i do not know...\",\n"," 'highly under-rated british comedy with many memorable characterisations, not a bad script, and a wonderful feel-good

gone to bed for the night and he heads off to the pub with price... only to bump into his pupils there. nicely done. other amusing sequences also, and i can sum up the film using an expression of dennis\\'s (one of the characters)... \"yeah! double neat!\"',\n"," 'another fun, witty, frothy rko musical with astaire and rogers, follow the fleet is a charming film. while it lacks the stand-out

together in the 1930\\'s. once again, the plot is lightweight and forgettable, but watching fred and ginger dance together is sheer heaven. these two conveyed more romance and magic in dance than many

there is that feeling of great injustice and anger that movies like this potentially manage to instill in viewers. granted, it does that so if you are looking for that... knock yourself out.',\n"," 'this film has caught me off guard a few times. at first i thought samir horn(don cheadle) was trying to infiltrate the terrorist organization who are suicide bombers that believes in something like the qur\\'an by earning there trust, but later it seemed that he was actually loyal to the terrorist organization or even a double agent. and thought it would show the film in the terrorist point of view from the main character, which probably would not have sit right with most americans. but later it is revealed that he does work for a organization that is trying to take down the terrorist group leader nathir and get a hold of the terrorist plans. even while playing this guessing game, i did not feel cheated because it was well crafted and gave some clues. i found the whole premise of samir going to prison in order to befriend omar who is a member of the terrorist organization a bit over the top, but there is way more over the top stuff that happens in these types of genres. i found the joke about how the suicide bombers are on a mission to get laid with 72 virgins pretty funny. since it is pretty much the truth, but the film shows that not every people that believe in allah are bad people and even the revealing of samir\\'s past shows this, who is also a firm believer in allah. in fact i did not necessarily hate samir or omar, even if omar is a real terrorist for some reason. maybe because of his honorable ways while being courageous, although being courageous is not necessarily a good thing. so basically agent roy clayton investigates a dangerous international conspiracy responsible for a prison break in yemen, a bombing in nice and a raid in london. and all clues seem to lead back to a former u.s special operations officer, samir horn. but soon contradictory evidence emerges, forcing clayton to question whether his suspect is a disaffected former military operative or something more complicated, like the movies tagline. i was expecting some flashy fast paced spy movie but it turned out different from what i expected in that, it has some good drama to go with the action in fact the film has more drama than action. the first hour of \"traitor\" was simply great, but after the first hour it started to lose it\\'s entertainment value and became a bit tedious. the parts after the first hour was not bad, but just was not good as the first hour of the film which kept me guessing. after the first hour, things start to get predictable, not that i knew what the ending was going to be or samir\\'s last plan, but i knew what direction it is going. the stupid character decisions that jeopardize the mission got a bit irritating as well, it just seemed illogical and irrational. it was a decent espionage thriller with few glitches to sum it up. 7.4/10',\n","

fincher would have been my first choice. how wrong i would have been. this film is by far one of the best if not the best of 2008. fincher's direction is flawless! the film from start to finish does not let up. there are moments of joy and ecstasy followed by sorrow and understanding. brad pitt stars as benjamin, a boy born an old man who must live his life in reverse. his friend from childhood, daisy, is played by cate blanchett. the story is narrated from benjamin's point of view with some particular highlights from daisy. the cast does nothing wrong. pitt leads with blanchett and a strong performance from taraji p. henson as benjamin's surrogate mother queenie, the only person in the world who seems to understand and truly love him from the start. other cameos along the way bring a large array of characters, including tilda swinton, one of benjamin's early love interests. the film spans from the end of world war i to the the arrival of hurricane katrina in new orleans. the transitions from life stage to life stage and decade to decade are seamless. fincher does a tremendous job at maintaining a steady flow of action and dialogue. there is not a dull moment in the film. the cinematography is superb and couples nicely with fincher's style of accentuating certain colors to enhance a mood or moment. there really is nothing wrong with this film. even with a runtime of about 160 minutes, time just flies by, much like it does for benjamin, only we are going forward. this is a tender and meaningful film you do not want to wish.\",\n"," 'the beginning of the goddamn

produced by william miller, jack ketchum\\'s the girl next door is a movie that few who\\'ve seen it will ever forget. black-hole dark and beyond harrowing, it\\'s nonetheless a carefully crafted work and also extraordinarily sensitive. in fact, if it\\'s not strictly a horror film, then one can only conclude that it\\'s the genre\\'s loss. jack ketchum\\'s novel, like much of his work, is based on compelling real-life events. in this instance the story draws upon a 1960s case of almost unspeakable child abusemost of that abuse committed by other children under adult supervision. ketchum, who is extremely proud of this film adaptation, speaks openly about production company moderncine\\'s initial pitch to him: \"let us make this movie before hollywood does and ruins it.\" to bring the girl next door to the screen, moderncine enlisted some topnotch talent, including award-winning director gregory wilson, who here displays a tremendous talent working with actors, and veteran writers philip nutman and daniel farrands. still, in a period when horror movies have repeatedly pushed, and even mangled, the envelope, this one derives most of its emotional shock not from graphic content but from the realistic and courageous presentation of a long-standing cultural taboo: on-screen violence to children. unfortunately, it\\'s all too easy for mainstream critics to shoot down this kind of movie by terming it \"exploitative\" when actually it\\'s the opposite: a tragedy that immerses the audience in the misery of the real rather than promoting escapism with comfortable, and clichéd, lessons about violence and evil. after a successful theatrical run in new york early in the fall, the girl next door is now available here on dvd. i urge you to see it. like another powerful film released in 2007, bug, it may hit too close to home to appeal to the typical horror fan. indeed, it has a slightly different audience in mind: human beings.',\n"," 'it\\'s somewhat telling that most of the great reviews for the film on imdb all come from people who have only reviewed one film in their entire imdb career and yes you have guessed it, that film is \"parasomnia\". i have often suspected suspiciously good reviews on imdb for what turns out to be an anything but good films as underhand marketing , but it seems fairly transparent in this case. that\\'s not to say parasomnia is terrible, but it stops well short of being the good or great film it had the potential to be. on the plus side, it has a great baddie in patrick kilpatrick who does a brilliant job projecting menacing and evil, i could easily see him having what it takes to play a truly memorable baddie on a par with hannibal lecter. there are some beautiful visuals in the dream sequences, in fact if the film had decided to explore that terrain more it might have been something better. the actual concept of devious misuse of hypnosis is great too. although i understand suspension of disbelief is necessary for immersion in any good story, it\\'s the mark of a good story that it succeeds in letting you do that. if you find yourself being annoyed at what you find illogical or just plain silly, then the story is losing you and that\\'s what kept happening to me with this film. other reviewers have mentioned this here and i do not want to get into spoiler territory, but i will say the setup at the ending was particularly ludicrous and disappointing, not too mention the varying mental age of a character that is only supposed to have experienced a few years of life. all in all, there is the germ of a great idea here in diabolically misused hypnotism, but sadly this film fails to realise it into anything special.',\n"," 'as did others in this forum, when \"fobidden planet\" was offered in 1956, i rushed to see it. this story is an interesting phenomenon i suggest because young, old, male, female, sci-fi experts and people who find such fare \\'way out\" all can follow and enjoy this film\\'s story and plot lines very well. this is the first movie set on a planet other than earth in the 20th century other than serials such as \"flash gordon\". leslie nielsen was vocally a bit weak for his

with the monster, the final approach of the unseen destroyer,the escape from the doomed planet--all these scenes are etched into the viewer\\'s mind because we discover them along with the

the film is carried by the words, the actors and the mystery-revelation storyline. it can be watched again and again with pleasure--i have been doing so for nearly fifty years. until this famous and well-loved film was created, no film had tried to imagine a world beyond earth; and for decades afterward, ships kept crashing back on the planet--as if the writers\\' imaginations were failing and

one sided) version of events, you should see \"waco: the big lie\". in summary, this is pretty much the definitive documentary about this tragic event, and is very sobering, but as a work of film-making, could test your patience, especially if you have a short attention span. and it\\'s at times superfluous for those who watched the cspan hearings and the 60 minutes reports. perhaps someday someone will make a documentary that covers some of the stranger aspects of this story, such as the bizarre chain of events that led up to the atf raid or the psychological warfare tactics the fbi used blasting rock music at the sect, and their charismatic leaders (all rock musicians themselves) picking up their instruments and turning their massive amplifiers outward to blast their own music right back at them.',\n"," \"i wanted to give drawing blood the benefit of the initial doubt. the opening moments, with a naked woman sprawled out and an painter, diana, about to paint her and then sucking her blood to drain out so she can use it for her art, give the impression that this could be a kick-ass artsy-vampire flick. turns out this initial impression turns out false. oh, troma, the mark of some kind of lack of quality: sometimes they'll offer up something that is trash but funny and with at least some competence to the junk-food craft (or, sometimes not). this is a case where it's not even a whole lot of fun to watch since its attempts at humor (i.e. the protagonist's father is an old vaudevillian who does jimmy durante impressions?) are weak at best, and any unintentional laughs are undercut by sergio lapel's bargain basement direction. and it's not without him trying, oh lord no. he does try a lot, which is a big part of the problem. he and his producers had money for lights, sure, but the way they are used in the movie made i, a former student filmmaker and aspiring director, sulking in my seat: if i saw this in a theater i would have to blind my eyes in many instances, and would wonder whether or not his dp understood really the basic 3-point lighting set-up. while this, along with a very lackluster sound design (or just lots of random loud humming like in the art gallery scene), should not be something that comes to attention during a troma release, it should be something *basic* that a filmmaker can tackle even if the script is not very funny or scary (and it is not) or if lapel does a weird mixture of songs placed at bizarre moments. it's not a good movie by any stretch, and perhaps if you are a vampire die-hard (or just a vampire period) it might have some appeal as a low-rent bargain basement alternative to near dark, or as a slight improvement over, say, 1972's blood freak. you have better ways to waste your time, overall.\",\n"," 'although the premise is interesting, this movie does not always carry it through well. that being said, this movie features some of the funniest lines i have ever heard in a movie,

that she gives good head, for instance, and her offer is accepted repeatedly, while between encounters she's got the stink of something best left outside -- and so she is. her need for acceptance appears driven by a deeper need for respect, for the recognition that she is worthy of more than service as a convenient warm body. it's a heart wrenching performance, and one that i recognized to the core of me from my own club days, during the times of my life when i was so lonely that i could not even *fake* self-respect convincingly. i was torn between wanting to shake her and wanting to hold

all excellent david morse does his quietly chilling thing and labeouf really surprises with a far more complex performance than we have come to expect from such genre fodder. sarah roehmer is clearly the weakest link, struggling to bring any level of depth or realism to her character. the screenplay by christopher landon is packed with inexplicable and gaping plot holes why is kale's mother, a realtor, never at home at night? where did all the party goers vanish to? why did the police never check the vin number on the neighbor's car? but such holes rarely get in the way of caruso's expert handling of the mounting tension. as is the way with promising horror/thrillers of late, however, (remember 'vacancy'?), a solid and suspenseful film morphs into a lazy and generic slasher movie in the final act. for those with an interest in such things, special note should be made of tom southwell, who spent the better part of twenty years as an illustrator on such movies as 'blade runner',

the cliched local characters ask julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide. one could argue that he does not answer, because it's none of their business. but julian is the one who, under only token pressure, blurted out his intentions in public. then neither julian nor the director/writer, despite the fact that the julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for god's sake, seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on julian's life. he says he was a bookkeeper. he says his family moved around when he was a child, due to his father's job. so what? there are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate julian's purpose. but none of them go anywhere, because julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet, as if he were the ultimate (and only) sane one among them. this might work as an allegory, if julian po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart. the closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive, religious wife of the mechanic. and what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for julian. i can only see the julian character --as rendered--as selfish, petty, and totally condescending. sort of matches the attitude of the

scared out of my wits! but many years on, i have grown to love what it is all about. in fact, i now laugh at what i guess i was so scared off. gremlins are creatures that are meant to scare and humour the audience at the same time. do not ever get it wet. keep it away from bright light. and no matter how much it cries, no matter how much it begs... never, ever feed it after midnight. with these instructions, young billy peltzer takes possession of his new cuddly pet, a gift from his father. but billy will get a whole lot more than he bargained for and the small quite town of kingston falls is in for a christmas they will never forget! the first point i want to discuss about this movie is that of the great story behind it. it was very original and one that i liked. i enjoyed the idea of little menacing creatures causing havoc in an innocent little town, and the way that the gremlins just take over. at the start of this film, the audience is aware that with the cute pet gizmo (a mogwai), comes much responsibility. i love the fact that there are three rules attached. if you break them, then all hell will break lose. it is an interesting concept and one i must say that worked. i feel that there has been some movies which have tried to copy the gremlins concept which do not even come close. the critters (and there sequels) for example, were a poor attempt in trying to follow on from the gremlins. the human cast of gremlins was a pretty good one. the well known person from the gremlins for me is the gorgeous phoebe cates. her character in this film is full of hurt and regret, which the audience i am sure feel sorry for, plus she also helps save the day. i recently saw her very first movie, fast times at ridgemont high. that was a one hell of a teenage film. cates looked stunning in it as well. playing the lead role of billy peltzer was zach galligan. zach has hardly been heard of since the role of billy in gremlins (and the sequel). yet i seem to ask myself the question, why? he was excellent in gremlins and a good choice as the main character. i guess he has done some other movie which have been flops. this includes the 1994 comedy all tied up, starring the stunning terri hatcher. it's now time to talk about the real stars' of this show. yes, those little green monsters. all credit needs to go to puppet makers in the gremlins. these things' looked so real. special comment needs to go to the creator of the stripe' gremlin. he was an amazing character. i want to say that the character of gizmo was very restricted. we hardly ever see the whole animal. i liked him much more the second time around. the gremlins is a movie that has so much happen in a little time. while these creatures remain mogwais', they are quite harmless, but once they turn into the gruesome gremlins they cause disaster after disaster. the scene in the school was quite satirical, with the gremlin having his revenge on the school teacher. the only criticism of this scene is that we never actually find out what happens to that gremlin. i guess he eventually meets up with whole group, but how does the viewing audience know this? then we have the hilarious scene at the peltzer household. the mother was quite game tackling those gruesome creatures. i love it when she blends one in the mixer and then fries one in the microwave. when stripe escapes, he hurts the small town of kingston falls. the scene at the ymca swimming pool was clever. then when you see all the gremlins walking into town you appreciate that they are not real. then you have the pub scene where kate is trapped serving all these mischievous characters, it was totally wild. also the scene with the snow plough going through the futterman's house was crazy and suits the gremlins totally. by the end we see one of the great pieces of directing, seeing all the gremlins in the cinema watching quite a tame film in snow white. plus the final battle between billy and stripe in the supermarket. it is so clever to see the little gremlin tackle billy with a chainsaw and a bow and arrow. plus we see the best scene with gizmo here. he is driving a barbie-doll car, which was cute. i wont describe the end, but i will say that it was quite gut wrenching. credit must go to the director and producer of gremlins. steven spielberg is a genius and one of the best producers in the business. his other movies which i have loved include e.t., the goonies, and jurassic park. i also enjoyed the directing of joe dante. he was very inventive and takes us on a wild roller-coaster ride with the gremlins. to say that the original gremlins film is a favourite of mine is an understatement. this movie is full of cuteness, cleverness, mischievousness and intelligence, all rolled into one. i also remember the posters advertising the gremlins in this country (australia). it was a gremlin peeking out of a toilet. when i saw that i just had to see it, even though i did get nightmares after doing so. so, if you are air conditioner goes on the fritz, or washing machine blows up, or your video recorder konks out, before you call the repairman, turn on all the lights and check under all the beds, cos you never can tell, there just might be a gremlin in your house! rating: 4 stars or 9/10.\",\n"," 'this was gene kelly\\'s breakthrough, and that alone makes it memorable. throw in rita hayworth as his love interest and comedian phil silvers of all people as his sidekick and you have the ingredients for a real crowd pleaser, which is exactly how it turned out. kelly plays danny mcguire, a nightclub owner in brooklyn (brooklyn is always the \"wrong side of the tracks\" in \\'40s films) whose star attraction and love interest is rusty parker (rita hayworth). rita is lovely, and even plays a dual role as rusty and rusty\\'s grandmother. rusty has a chance at the big time through the machinations of john coudair (otto kruger), who romanced and lost rusty\\'s grandmother. the plot revolves around danny cutting rusty loose, to the detriment of his club, because she has a chance at success that he can not give her. but, naturally, that\\'s not what rusty ultimately wants, because, as usual in films of that time, the right guy is the only thing on the girl\\'s mind. there are no surprises, but everybody does their thing well. kelly does the first of his amazing trick dances, this time with himself as a reflection from a glass window. he was the master at that sort of dance, and one still has to wonder how they timed everything so precisely so that he really does seem to be in two places at once. the melodrama gets a bit thick, and there are some gratuitous war references thrown in that do little but provide the opportunity for a song or two, but kelly takes this film to the next level. this was before he became a mega-star and too smooth perhaps for his own good. an underlying edge of rawness to his character lends it a believable and almost wistful air. kelly\\'s character in the 1980 \"xanadu\" also was named danny mcguire. this film was the beginning, that film the end, of a terrific run for a dancing genius. clearly, this film meant a lot to him. highly recommended.',\n"," \"midwest married couple, george and gwen kellerman, chronicle their big apple nightmares when george races to make a job interview, and everything seems to go

again, is the epitome of 'perfect timing' and has the material down pat, and dennis is great at looking jet-lagged and harried. neither of these actors goes too much over the top as to seem unbelievable, and (personally) their is enough credible 'couple' chemistry to support this. on the remake: steve martin and goldie hawn reprised the kellerman roles in a recent remake of the untouchable simon original script. there was promise in adding to lemmon's original 'george' portrayal, but martin does nothing to improve on the other actors previous comedic timings, and overall portrayal of a neurotic businessman bent on getting every manhattanite's name down so that he can later sue them for whatever inconvenience he (or his wife) has been subjected to. hawn only has one notable seen in the remake (as wife 'gwen'), when she throws her scene of furor at the police station.\",\n"," 'should really have been called, big bad and beautiful, as this is hollywood movie-making on a grand scale with a big budget, a-list director and a starry cast producing a high quality melodrama centred on the world of movie-making itself. unusually constructed around three separate lengthy flashbacks of past associates (a director, actress and writer, played by barry sullivan, lana turner and dick powell) of boy-genius jonathan shields (a composite, perhaps of david o selznick and orson welles) played with total conviction and no little vigour by an emergent kirk douglas, these serve to lay bare, warts and all, his larger than life character by the conclusion, leaving the viewer to decide for themselves whether this golden boy with feet of clay is deserving of our admiration or derision. of course we are steered in the former direction not only by douglas\\'s terrific performance but also by the clever concluding scene when sullivan, turner and powell, all with ample reason to have nothing do with him, still find themselves effortlessly drawn into his comeback plans. the film is a celebration of errant genius with an appreciation that such talents are frequently flawed in character and cause casualties along the way. the acting is uniformly excellent even though douglas\\' name should really be above turner\\'s in the titles, given the relative scale of their parts, never mind their performances. besides the leads mentioned above, gloria grahame shines again as the fey southern belle wife of the unexciting pragmatic writer played by powell, swept off her feet by a latin smoothie set up by shields. minnelli\\'s direction is effortless, purveying numerous backstage insights on and off-camera. the story itself is highly melodramatic and improbable but nevertheless extremely entertaining and to paraphrase bette davis in the near contemporary

crap-movie, with treat williams trying to come up with one-liners all the time. it\\'s very clear which are the clips from other films, since both the quality of the film and the actors change between

i have not seen, for example, superbabies: baby geniuses 2 (#5 at the time of this publication), i would venture to guess that that film is considerably better than this oozing wound, because even in its vapid dismalness at least baby geniuses 2 was professionally made. by contrast, everything, and i do mean everything, in this film is completely unprofessional. the movie is intended to be an attack on the christian right\\'s supposed bigotry and hatred toward gays. and i do emphasize \"intended.\" not only does it completely and utterly fail at its purpose, it also leaves an ugly scar. instead of creating a compelling and realistic portrait of a gay couple\\'s struggle against a society that largely opposes them, it creates tired, crass stereotypes of each party involved. ben and arthur, the namesake couple, are portrayed as two crude, sex-starved, and hopelessly romantic cardboard cutouts who marry when the laws change to allow them to do so. this meets with the opposition of ben\\'s brother victor, a christian minister who, like all christians (as this movie would have us believe), is loud, prying, stupid, and violent. he tries to kill ben and arthur after his associations with them get him kicked out of the ministry. just like in real life. and if you think that\\'s dreadful (it is), you have not seen it all. the actors (?) here manage to completely destroy any vestige of credibility in this movie by saying their lines as if they were narrating a youtube home comedy video. but not even daniel day-lewis and marlon brando as the title characters could have saved this clunker, for there would still be the matter of the completely inane and laugh-inducing dialogue that fills every minute of the movie. every scene has at least one awkward or misplaced quote. for example, in one scene, victor tries to complain about not being able to have nieces or nephews because of his brother\\'s homosexuality. but instead of portraying this idea clearly, he spits out the stupid, utterly confusing, whiny-sounding line, \"you know what, i am never going to have any nieces or nephews, okay, because you are so f**ed up!\" even more glaring is the complete lack of production values. yes, i know this ain\\'t the dark knight, but even amateur film makers should know some basics about special effects and editing. for example, six dots of red cake dye do not suffice for realistic bullet wounds. people do not teleport across a room between takes. and objects do not fall forward when shot! do not waste your money on ben & arthur. i do not care if you are 7, 17, or 107. i do not care if you are gay, straight, bi, or undecided. i do not care if you are \"just curious.\" i do not care what pathetic reason you may have to be tempted to buy this

to sunny california. they never reach their destination as they decide to pull over at the rest stop. after a fight with her boyfriend, nicole carrow insists on pulling in to a rest stop. when she is ready to leave, she exits the bathroom to find her boyfriend has disappeared with their car, leaving her trapped on the back roads of texas with only an abandoned camper van to keep her company. rest stop is one of those cheap and tacky horror movies that could become a cult classic. will rest stop become a cult classic you may ask? well the three elements that you need to become a cult classic are gore, sex and artistic merit. rest stop has bucket loads of gore, and while i do not want to give too much away, it contains oodles of blood-soaked nastiness. this movie has everything from the bad guy running over a cop's legs with his car several times to him making use of a pneumatic drill on a girl's leg. at times, it can be about as bloody as a film can get. it also has a gratuitous and yet somehow quite intimate love scene in the opening minutes of the film. therefore, the sex is covered. now the hard one does it have any artistic merit? you never get to see the bad guy's face you see glimpses, profiles, shadowy silhouettes. he is a faceless, relentless, monster, which alone scores highly on the artistic merit scale. the movie has very few characters in it apart from the main protagonist nicole carrow (jaimie alexander). since she spends a large part of the film on her own, she cannot reveal her thoughts in the course of a conversation, but must speak them aloud so that we, the audience, know what she is thinking. at times, this can be slightly irritating; however, it is a brave step by the writer (john shiban) and it does work for the majority of the film. as an audience knows, being completely alone and isolated from civilisation is frightening enough even when you are not being chased by psychotic killers. so, will rest stop become a cult classic? it probably will because along the gore, sex and arguable artistic merit, it also has plenty of chills, an interesting and inventive plot and gives rise to a lot of shouting at the screen as the main character does plenty of things you should definitely not do when running from a psychotic killer.

their role. each personal life is examined, past and present. supporting cast in the form of prisoners and guards are also extremely well developed and integrated into the story. nothing happens without a reason, everything is intertwined. a well done gem of a film that breaks away from the standard bollywood fare.\",\n"," \"thank god that there are films out there that do not follow the same old hollywood crap formula. i think the digital revolution and the dvd revolution is actually making it possible for more interesting work to get out there even if you have to dig harder to find it. i

confused. what really blew my mind was the way they used martin luther king's speeches about vietnam and references to his assassination in a way that hit me hard. i found myself choked up every time i heard his voice. i have heard him speak before, of course, but the way they used the speeches here made me feel like i understood his message in a way i'd never thought about. what can you say about a movie that has heavy statistics about war, oppression and a plea for compassion at the end of it where a credits crawl would usually be? in fact, there's no credits at all in the film. you have to access them by selecting them in the features. somehow that made me think a lot. all in all i can not say enough about this dvd. brilliant.\",\n"," 'consistency is perhaps this movie its biggest problem. the movie starts of as a fast, stylish and just plain fun political satire but in its second halve the movie gets more serious of tone, in an almost oliver stone kind of way. it\\'s of course also a very serious subject but i would say that the movie would had been way better and also more effective if it had been completely done in the same style as the first halve of the movie got shot in. for a biography and a movie concerning the subject of this movie, the movie is also quite short with its mere 102 minutes of running time. the movie because of this feels like it is not telling the whole story. of course the following up of the events after the soviet occupation of afghanistan gets hinted at in the movie but the movie does not go deeper into it and it does not explain much about it, which feels like a cheap way to just glorify charlie wilson, without showing the other side of the medal. also the actual events in the movie itself gets rather simplified, even though the story still gets told (needlessly) complex at times. yes, the movie would just had been way better if it was not trying to be so serious at times and overall more light with its style and atmosphere. the movie should had been for instance more like \"wag the dog\", that achieved to find a right combination of satire and sensitive political issues. because of this incoherent style and way of storytelling, the acting performances are also mixed. when tom hanks is playing his character more playfully and in a more comical kind of way he\\'s just excellent. but this just makes it sort of hard to take his character serious in the more serious and sensitive/shocking moments of the movie. philip seymour hoffman is always excellent though, as he is in any movie that he plays in. he also received an oscar nomination for his role in this movie. most of the other actors just seem to walk around in this movie, just to be in the movie. this goes mostly for julia roberts, whose character i found just too mysterious to seem to have a clear enough purpose for the movie. she made a redundant impression on me and is therefor also really forgettable in this movie. it\\'s not that the movie is a bad watch, it actually is quite good and also enjoyable but if the movie would had dared to be a bit more edgier the movie would had been a better and foremost also more effective one at what it tried to obviously achieve. 7/10',\n"," \"this film reminded me of the sopranos, and not in a good way. david chase's seminal mob opera only ever put its foot wrong twice, the most jarring and inexplicable instance of which took place in its fourth season, when junior soprano went on trial for his life. rather than pursue this riveting (and pivotal) plot line, the writers instead chose to completely ignore it, focusing instead on bobby baccalieri's constant whimpering over his recently deceased wife's frozen pasta dish. when something of genuine interest happens in notorious - for example that first, mysterious assassination attempt on tupac shakur that ignited the whole east coast/west coast feud in the first place, and ended up leading to the deaths of both tupac and christopher wallace - the film treats it as just another bit of plot to plod through. why exactly was tupac so convinced that he was sold out by his own people? did he alone nurture his subsequent affiliation with suge knight? and was lil' kim's transformation from prim office drone into sex-obsessed, vampish diva really as banal as it appears here? none of these questions are even fleetingly addressed by the film's screenwriters, who are far more interested in depicting wallace's turbulent love life to zero compelling dramatic avail. these sequences (including a brain-frazzlingly clichéd groupie indescretion in a hotel room) are so toothless and bruisingly manipulative that the only real comparison to be made is with a network tv movie. the storytelling, in both structure and content, is simplistic and trite. but more fundamentally, as a biopic; as something designed to celebrate its subject and educate the uninitiated on the intricacies of their life and work; the film is almost entirely worthless. the reliance on meat-and-potatoes genre plotting, coupled with the lifeless musical performances (an area in which a film like this should soar, surely) result in a film that appears to have been designed only to satisfy the whims and demands of those involved, leaving wallace's questionable status as a giant in his field as the preserve of the easily persuaded and previously converted only. and the final twenty minutes, in which wallace's posthumous cultural identity is broadly painted as being akin to that of a latter day saint, quite frankly made me feel like throwing up. on that score, much as with any other, notorious is crass, calculating and compromised.\",\n"," '\"asylum\" is not actually offensive or incompetent, so i could not give it a single star.

of the horror trash being churned out these days. the sfx range from pretty scary and subtle to just plain laughable (see the last scene, for example.) what really makes this film a bore is the lousy plot and script. it truly does play like it was filmed from a script assembled by throwing the scripts from classic horror movies (and some that are not so classic) up in the air and then picking up random pages after they fall. not every horror film cliché appears in this film, but there are no scenes in this film that are not horror clichés. the dialogue is just totally unrealistic. no suspense... no character development... no logic. so who\\'s fault is this big mess? i have got to pick on the director. he had to have seen what he was working with. it\\'s possible to film a decent

of the cia) of fbi agent. but, to make him an investigator for the bureau of weights and measures was indeed odd--especially since, at times, he acted pretty much the same way he did in the movie g-men! all in all, a time passer and that\\'s about it. finally, the videotape i saw this on from memory lane video was perhaps one of the poorest i have ever encountered. the sound was terrible and scratchy and the print looked very white and had lots of torn film and gaps.',\n"," \"apart from the low budget, there never seems to be more than 50 germans in one scene at any one time, plus the

china as an english teacher and worked in four different universities while there. i was able to talk to a lot of people and heard many horror stories about what took place in china after the revolution in the 50\\'s. the mass persecution of christians still goes on, and many are continuing to lose their lives and their freedom, simply because they are christians. most people my age did not have any photos of themselves or their families taken while they were growing up. during the cultural revolution photos (and most anything else like musical instruments, art, foreign clothing, books, or even nicer furniture) were not allowed and were destroyed or buried, as you could be severely punished for having them, since they were considered \"foreign\" i even heard of a lady putting her family photos in soup ( when her house was being searched by red guards) to get rid of them lest she be caught. there were mao statutes everywhere, and i was told that if you did take a photo with one of them in the background and cut of his head in the picture, that you could be punished or even killed. teachers were taken out of the classroom in front of their students and paraded through town wearing dunce caps. it was a terrible, terrible, time especially if you were an educated person or desired to think for yourself.',\n"," 'all right, enough with the mst3k-ing, people. i of course saw this movie through the show, and i thought their treatment of it was hilarious. it\\'s one of my favorite episodes. surprisingly enough though, unlike many other movies ridiculed by mike and the bots, this one is far from bad. maybe it\\'s just the sheer number of times that i have seen it that has made it grow on me like some kind of low-budget lichen. of course the acting is sub-par and at times could wilt flowers on the side of the road. i would not expect stellar performances from a collection of actors coming out of rural vermont. the whole time travel concept involving a small engine aircraft is laughable i\\'ll admit. the portrayal of the future is hardly better than a shot of a present day main-street strip. there are a number of minor holes in the plot, one of which involves how nick managed to get a gun after falling into a lake out of the plane. another would be the way that the future was unaltered even though automatic weapons and the wreckage of a plane/time machine were left in revolutionary war-era america. honestly though, i believe that these shortcomings were inevitable given the budgetary constraints of the film. the film was cut and edited well, which are aspects i believe to be important in a film of any budget. take a look at the shoddy editing in some films with budgets over 100 million dollars and it\\'s almost shameful by comparison. corny by mainstream hollywood standards, i believe that this film should be viewed for what it is: an impressive achievement by an unknown low-budget filmmaker. i think we should be asking ourselves, given a camera and a few thousand dollars to make a movie about time travel, \"could we have done better?\"',\n"," 'coral reef adventure: 3 out of 10: do you like pretty pictures? do you hate global

if it is remixed and sung by starving children to a peter gabriel back up band? then you might enjoy global reef adventure. everyone else above 12 should check there eyeballs before watching, as rolling them this much could cause permanent damage. this is the story of a husband and wife team who investigate the death of a villages reef in fiji. it turns out the villain was... hold on before i give away the big surprise let me explain a few things. my girlfriend and i had just finished watching john hurt in michael radfords nineteen eighty-four and i put this documentary on because i thought a nice short colorful coral reef film might be nice after such a grey depressing movie. (plus a piece of coral was a feature object in the former drab film so i was going for a subtle synergy). little did i know i was putting on a piece of propaganda so heavy handed that big brother himself would have blushed. look no matter how you feel about global warming the villain in this piece was clearly those nice fijians who were logging and overfishing and killed their own damn reef. the movie clearly shows this and then completely ignores its own findings to declare global warming the boogey man (though in this particular case it was obviously innocent. as local reefs not near the giant silt runnoff and not located in the fishing grounds were thriving.) but the fijians cant be guilty of course cause the look so cute in their sunday best and they have quite a haunting rendition of marrakesh express. such propaganda, no matter how well intentioned, needs to be called to the carpet. in particular when it is aimed towards children. the film has other faults as well. it is over produced by half with wipes and sound effects that look like they belong in a disney ducktales movie. top billed liam neeson narrates for all of a minute and top billed jean-michel cousteau appears for about as long. it probably isnt that bad a film with the mute on. for one thing you would miss the appeal at the end to support politicians who hate global warming (boo hiss). apparently 2 plus 2 does sometimes equal 5.',\n"," \"i thought king solomon's mines was beautifully done. my only reservation was alison doody. her acting was superb but her makeup and hair was not of the period, and always seemed to make her look out of place next to the other actors. i thought patrick swayze was an excellent choice for alan quatermain. it was nice seeing a seasoned, rugged looking actor in this role after sitting through movie after movie with the fair haired, fair skinned actors like val kilmer, brad pitt, etc. he was an excellent choice and i enjoyed every minute of this movie. this version cannot be compared with the 1950's version with stewart grainger. it was a big screen movie and not a made for tv movie. i thought both quatermains were believable but the two medias have to be kept separated. i am looking forward to seeing this once more, and i hope patrick swayze will again look to these type of roles.\",\n"," 'the first half of this movie is a crime mystery. the second half is a love story. i thought that i would know what happened next and for the most part i was right. thre were a few surprises and i admit i did not see the ending coming. although once i saw it kinda made sense who the killer was. i just thought that the movie was repetitive in its dialog in some parts. al pacino is his usual self in one of his come back roles were he has picked up the deep voice and the dark eyes. besides one scene in a shoe store i think his performance is rather average. no where in the league of later works such as scent of a women and glenn gary glenn ross. in the confines of the script the actors did what they could so i give it a generous seven.',\n"," \"i figured that any horror film with orson welles in it would be weird. necromancy sure was but it was a little too weird for it's own good. the film does indeed have a creepy feel as it deals with a coven of satanists/witches in a small town and a young woman's attempt to escape them. the director though seems to be deliberately trying to confuse the audience by using flashbacks and dream sequences. by the finale, there are too many unanswered questions. what's worse, as the story is so confusing, it's pretty hard to root for any of the characters. it seems odd that welles would agree to headline this film especially since he does not have that much to do. maybe someday they will put out a tape of the outtakes and bloopers from this movie. now that would really be fun!\",\n"," 'nothing sacred is a look at modern celebrity at it\\'s worse and most bathetic. and god bless it for taking it all apart. wally cook (fredric march) is an able newspaper reporter, who when plastered (which appears to be frequently) creates hoaxes at the expense of his newspaper and his boss oliver stone (yeah, really - only he\\'s played by walter connolly here). at the start of this film, wally has an african-american named ernest jones (troy brown jr.) pretend to be \"the sultan of marzepan\" a wealthy far eastern potentate who is planning to donate millions to build some kind of multi-cultural center in manhattan*. at the last moment his wife shows up with their children (the wife is hattie macdaniel), and she wrecks the hoax just as connolly is taking credit for the donation for his newspaper. *oddly enough there has recently been a two part news item in the new york times about the plans (in abu dhabi) for a cultural center and university on a large scale. but this seems to be a legitimate scheme. from the start ben hecht\\'s script follows the idea of how we, the sophisticates who live in cities (especially new york) are far more gullible than we would imagine. wally is first banished to the obituary column of the paper (ernest is given a janitorial job - this film is from the 1930s, by the way, so some stereotyping is going to be here). after a month wally begs for a chance to resume his old job. oliver, somewhat reluctantly, ends up giving wally a scoop to interview a young woman in a new england town named hazel flagg (carole lombard). hazel worked in one of those factories where they used radium based paint on watches, so she has been diagnosed by the local doctor (enoch downer - charles winninger) as dying of radium poisoning. wally goes to the town of warsaw, and finds the natives nosy, secretive, and hostile (one little kid even bites wally on the leg). he finds hazel and makes the offer that oliver has for her - if she will come to new york city, the newspaper will give her first rate hotel accommodations, fine dining, take to all the sites, and have the city lay out the official red carpet to her - until the day she dies. hazel gleefully accepts - she hates being stuck in her town. of course she fails to mention that dr. downer (who is a heavy drinker) botched up her test, and the lab has now revealed that she is healthy as a horse and will not die. she takes downer with her and wally to make sure he keeps quiet. the film then follows her rise to international celebrity trumpeted by oliver\\'s newspaper, the mayor\\'s office, and other interested parties. she is invited to all sorts of events (when she attends a wrestling match, the two wrestlers - supposedly killing each other - stop to greet her with smiles). a collapse at a nightclub (due to drinking too much) is mistaken for an early sign of her mortal illness (sentimental oliver begs dr. downer not to spare him the worst - the next edition is going out in half an hour!). in the meantime hazel and wally have fallen in love - but hazel does not know how to break the bad news to wally: that she may live to a fine old age! many of the screwball comedies of the 1930s do not work so well today, due to changes in our perspectives. certainly the jokes at the start concerning ernest jones are not so funny now - although hecht did work in a scene where ernest gets some back (having been called a fake by oliver and others at the newspaper, ernest stumbles into the truth about hazel - and when he sees the others is swallowing it does not give a word of warning). but for the most part nothing sacred works pretty well to this day, and showcases lombard in her best screwball performance, ably supported by march in a comic turn for a change.',\n"," 'horror films are a curious thing, sometimes they manage to stumble across a formula that works very well, sometimes they try valiantly to tell a worthy story despite time and budget problems, sometimes they are so bad they are actually kinda fun... and sometimes they are \"the cavern\". a good horror/suspense film should contain vagaries that keep you guessing, they should allow you to be interested in the characters and their motivations so that you actually have some sort of reaction when they die. however, the cavern chooses instead to introduce elements that work at first, only to be negated by it\\'s own lackluster storytelling. all the characters are completely forgettable and any actual back story that might make any of them even remotely interesting is blurted out within a 30 second monologue, making it impossible to do anything more than laugh as characters are picked off almost at random and on more than one occasion in the least possibly frightening way. (to spoil a scene a bit, one victim is taken during a complete blackout which might have been a little frightening if the sound effect used to indicate his killing was not reminiscent of stirring a pot of too thick macaroni and cheese) add to this formula the camera that work makes me think the director saw one too many nine inch nails videos and an ending which in an attempt to be shocking serves almost no purpose but to annoy and confuse the viewer and you have an almost completely unwatchable horror film that fails on every level. i\\'ll be honest with you, if you want a claustrophobic caving horror movie go watch \"the descent\", and i feel weird saying that because i did not particularly enjoy that movie either.',\n"," 'there was a time when my best friend and i, as teenagers, decided to see every single film that a local second-run multiplex carried. we pulled it off for over 2 years, and saw lots of great movies. this was not one of them. we avoided seeing fievel goes west for most of its run; we found out it was going to be pulled out, though, and saw the last showing on the last day. we learned several things; one- parents of children are very suspicious of older males without children, when they are in a children\\'s movie. two- bluth and spielburg hate childless people. i found the movie to be cloyingly sweet, with a childish plot and script, annoying dialogue, idiotic jokes, and very little in the way of humor. granted, were i three, the movie would have been a gas, but unlike many other \"childrens\\'\" movies, there is *nothing* directed at the adults in the audience. no asides, no double-layered jokes... nothing. the voice-acting is great, of course, but i cringe when i think of what the movie makers put their talented cast through. every voice actor and actress in this deserves something better... the animation is great and disneyesque, but very \"bouncy\". i do not know how else to describe it. everyone\\'s skeletal structure is 100% cartilage or something... after years of watching anime, despite the quality of the animation, it\\'s actually embarrassing to watch. at least it\\'s not as bad as the 30\\'s van beuren stuff. i can appreciate the technical wherewithal, but not the \"entertainment value\" of this style of animation... bottom line? bring a kid along, and enjoy the child\\'s enjoyment... otherwise you are going to need insulin afterwards.',\n"," 'in case the point has not been hammered home hard enough, this movie sucks. a lot. i am the kind of guy who, by default, tends to see the good things in movies. this film was so hideously bad that i felt ashamed for even watching it. urgh!',\n"," \"i often feel like scrooge, slamming movies that others are raving about - or, i write the review to balance unwarranted raves. i found this movie almost unwatchable, and, unusual for me, was fast-forwarding not only through dull, clichéd dialog but even dull, clichéd musical numbers. whatever originality exists in this film -- unusual domestic setting for a musical, lots of fantasy, some animation -- is more than offset by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thought-provoking plot development. individually, june haver and dan dailey appear to be nice people, but can not carry a movie as a team. neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal. they are both bland. i like billy gray, but his character is pretty one-note. the best part of the film, to me, are june haver's beautiful costumes and great body.\",\n"," '\"the day time ended\" is an incredible picture. in some ways, it\\'s better than \"close encounters of the third kind.\" (i prefer cheesy independent flicks to big budget spectaculars.) the special effects are cheesy, but that\\'s a big part of the fun. jim davis gives an excellent performance in this film. it\\'s probably one of the best roles he ever had in a feature. the musical score is very good. the story does not make sense. but that only makes it all the more intriguing. like many of the best works of art, \"the day time ended\" is not afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. \"the day time ended\" may be a low budget indie film, but it is not too much of a stretch to compare it with the \"existential\" european films of the fifties and sixties.

the money for the ticket or the vhs / dvd. a typical \"chick-feel-good-flick\", one could say. the plot itself is as shallow as it can be, a ridiculous and uncritical version of the american dream. the young good-looking girl from a small town becoming a big success in new york. the few desperate attempts of giving the movie any depth fail, such as the \"tragic\" accident of the father, the \"difficulties\" of violet\\'s relationship with her boyfriend, and so on. mcnally (director) tries to arouse the audience\\'s pity and sadness put does not have any chance to succeed in this attempt due to the bad script and the shallow acting. especially piper perabo completely fails in convincing one of \"jersey\\'s\" fear of singing in front of an audience. the only good (and quite funny thing) about \"coyote ugly\" is john goodman, who represents the small ray of hope of this movie. i was very astonished, that jerry bruckheimer produced this movie. first \"gone in 60 seconds\" and now this... what happened to great movies like \"the rock\" and \"con air\"? that was true bruckheimer stuff. if you are looking for a superficial movie with good looking women just to have a relaxed

difficult to bring a 450 pages book down to a three hours film. i read the book before, and i found the bbc production dealing with this difficulty in the best way possible. the qualities of the book have not been lost: the dense and lively depiction of a fingersmith patchwork family in london in the 1860s, the cold and obscene cruelty in which maud is brought up, the characterization of different social groups by different ways of speaking, the unexpected and surprising twists of the story, the way the film makes the spectators look different at the same scenes when they are told first from sue's point of view then from maud's one. the main actors do very good, and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed, with a first culmination in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and did to each other, because they still love each other. for each of her books the author, sarah waters, has thoroughly investigated what life was like in british 19th century. while in tipping the velvet it was the world of the vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements, in affinity the dreadful reality of women penitentiaries and the fashionable evocation of spirits, in fingersmith she depicts the public ceremony of hanging people in london and the inhuman treatment of persons supposed or declared disturbed in asylums based on the reading of sources and scientific research. this is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high grade of historic truth. i highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful victorian atmosphere, vivid emotions, and suspense.\",\n"," 'according to the movie slang, a \"slide\" is a guy so dumb he even

especially if you have seen almost any other half-way decent sci-fi film before. cypher manages to drag all the way through its relatively short 95 minutes right to the incompetent ending. none of the characters spark off each other, and for a film made in 2002 the technology is truly cheesy. it is difficult to connect this tired and uninspired movie with the director of cube. it's not a bad movie,

about poker. it represents a rare and earnest attempt to bring to the silver screen a true story of ultimate gambling compulsion. the complete obsession that annihilates any proximity of spirituality and nullifies any chance of redemption. this is the least likely movie a vegas casino executive would recommend. and it is the sole poker dvd you are likely to find on the shelves of gamblers annonymous. there are scenes in this movie that poker buffs are sure to refer to as some of the best gambling scenes ever. stu reading his opponent's hand and, particularly, a texas hold'em bluffing scene. prophetically, early on in the movie we see a young stu bullied out of his pocket change by a bunch of neighborhood hoodlums. poker is for loners seeking revenge. it is a game of patience which bullies lack. 'you can not bully me!' may very well be an underlying sentiment of the punishing force that a champion poker player unleashes upon his adversaries. conservatives will look upon this film as a cautionary tale of a soul lost in sin. they may evoke mark twain: 'the best throw at dice is to throw them away.' the young and liberal masses will inevitably have a more simplistic and sympathetic outlook. they may not have heard of twain's quote, but will sure remember a remark made by stu's stunned pal who learns from up-and-coming stuey that he'd won a car from a local character in an overnight game.

repeatedly shoots him he kills phil by biting his neck. grant survives but the killer disappears into the night... the 'national security agency' contacts grant about the incident, the agencies director says that what he, & phil, were dealing with was a renegade vampire. he carries on to inform grant that there are about 4000 vampires worldwide & they revealed themselves to 'us' to try & live in harmony together, he also says that vampires are genetic mutations & feed on a synthetic substitute for blood. grant is assigned a new partner, a vampire named aaron gray (adrian paul) & they are told to work together to discover the identity of the serial killing vampire who wants to sabotage the peace between the two races... this american hungarian co-production was directed by michael oblowitz & is average at best. the script by christos n. gage & ruth fletcher is the real problem here. too many things just did not work for me, for a start could a high ranking scientist create a virus that has the potential to wipe out the entire human race without a single person questioning him or finding out? i mean the guy is even using the 'nation security agency' laboratories for christ's sake! considering the vampire race has been around for 1000's of years it seemed strange that there was only 4000 throughout the entire world & that they had never been noticed before. the central relationship between grant the human & gray the vampire was clichéd & really cheesy, i mean at first they do not do not get on & seem mismatched but by the end they are best of friends & have saved each other's lives, we have seen it all before & done a lot better. the whole story is predictable & i can not believe it took gray over half the film to figure out the painfully obvious. the whole concept just did not work as far as i am concerned & the film spent a good 30 minutes explaining it's own set of vampire 'rules' as grant would ask a question like how to kill a vampire & gray would tell him thus making sure we, the viewer that is, know as well. the breed also makes a few feeble attempts to say things about racism, trust & acceptance, you know all the clichéd things one would expect. director oblowitz thinks he's making a cross between the matrix (1999), lethal weapon (1987) & vampires (1998), well no-one told him that you need a budget to pull that off. he films the fight scenes with people 'flying' through the air plus shooting & reloading their guns in a 'cool' way but they come off as looking ridiculous. he films everything with bleached out colours & a greenish tint. as for the films supposed style, you need to do a bit more than tilt the camera, shine a few neon lights & have some mist swirling in every shot. the gore is none existent, one neck biting, a couple of slit throats, a few gunshot wounds & someone explodes cgi style at the end & it looks terrible. with a really low budget of about $400,000 it shows. the breed has reasonable production values but it looks cheap throughout & you can tell it was shot in europe, in this case hungary. even though it is meant to be set in the future the cars, clothes & the like suggest otherwise. i found the acting awful, whats with the gay moustache paul? woodbine gives a terrible performance & just was not right for the role at all. ling bai is quite sexy looking whenever she appears. i was disappointed by the breed, it's one of those films that make a fantastic trailer when they show all the cool bits in the space of two & a half minutes set against some techno music. unfortunately there's another eighty seven & a half minutes to sit through if you decide to watch it. personally i did not think much of it.\",\n"," \"ok, so obviously ppl thought this was a good

it\\'s supposed to be, it does not really work. it just is not that funny. setting that rather significant (since this is called a comedy!) failure aside, since i have no personal knowledge of the subject matter, i\\'ll avoid comment about the authenticity of the story - which deals with the goings on behind the scenes in a toronto massage parlour, except to say that - if this is true - the life is pretty dull. for over an hour, this movie really does not give us much of anything except some background knowledge of the main characters. conrad is the newly hired manager of the massage parlour whose basic job apparently is to make sure the girls are not giving \"full service\" - a euphemism for actual sex. as for the girls themselves, betty\\'s goal is to buy a parlour of her own so that she can run her own business, cindy is an illegal immigrant to canada working to support her family back home and leah is - well, leah is a somewhat strange, undefined character with a nipple fetish - true - who seems to be in the business because - well, because she\\'s in it! i have no idea what her character was about. those three may well fairly reasonable composite characters who accurately represent the motivations of the women who get involved in this business. the movie meanders about and does not offer much until the \"twist\" reveals conrad to be the bad guy. we should have gotten to that point sooner. the only thing truly interesting here was that part of the story - conrad\\'s secret plan and the revenge plotted against him by the girls. that plan for revenge was pretty good, and you are grateful when it comes out because basically up to that point you are wondering why you wasted your time with this. had the story been more focused on the revenge, this might have actually been a fairly funny movie. the performances from the 4 leads were all ok, although i did not think anyone came across as outstanding. all four characters were a bit shallow. cindy was a sympathetic character, and so was conrad for a while, although he turns out to be the bad guy of the movie. given the subject matter, there\\'s surprisingly little nudity (and what there is is restricted to one scene.) in fact, there even a certain air of innocence around a lot of this. as for the overall quality of the movie, it\\'s a low-budget effort, which shows, although you expect a certain griminess, i suppose, of a movie set in the context of a body rub parlour, so that\\'s forgivable. it certainly says something, though, that this was released 8 years ago now and is still the only credit on writer-director soo lyu\\'s resume and - given the normal lack of depth in the canadian film industry - that it was not even deemed worthy of being nominated for any genie awards - the canadian version of the oscars. 4/10 - and i am being a bit generous with that.',\n"," 'antonioni\\'s movies have aged not well. what always surprised me about them is that, besides an unquestionable

sing up him in \"la notte\", or monica vitti laughing at the peasants flirting in the train in \"la aventura\", or ferzetti dropping the glass of ink at the end of the same film. i have reviewed

leaves the meeting, steals an aeroplane and flies over the desert in order to liberate himself and find \"something different\". - the executives in grey suites speak all the time about speculation. - the girl looks at the \"object women\" in the swimming pool and leaves because she wants not to be like them. - the couple of fat middle-class in the caravan speak, in front of the beauty of the nature, of building a hotel and earning a lot of money. - last but not the least, a lot of couples making love in the desert. what a hippie platitude! sorry, today, half a century after the

fitting into their adopted home has had many good runs on the big screen, as well as a number of excellent tv and radio series (goodness gracious me, etc). this one falls flat. inspite of a good start it rapidly went down hill. ultimately this was a horribly typical bbc effort, complete with strong regional accents, whacky over-acting characters, a \"those were the days\" soundtrack, and lots of \"issues\" in an attempt to be worthy. i found myself cringing at many points during this film. the writing is predictable. every possible cliche was dragged out and aired. in fact, i have trouble thinking of any cross-cultural/cross-generational devices that could have been used that were not. the characters were thin and cliched: the eccentric non-conformist minister; the well meaning but ultimately racist old woman; the over weight, overbearing aunt; the pushy indian parents; the working class neighbour; the \\'wise\\' profound grandmother; the motorbike riding thug. the script was weak, with every chance to shock the audience with overt racist dialogue from the two dimentional racist white characters taken. and why it had to be set in the 70\\'s (apart from needing an excuse for a 70\\'s soundtrack) is a mystery. possibly it make unbelievable characters slightly more believable to people born after 1979. i do not know. even these things aside, good acting could have carried this into respectable obscurity. instead, the usual \"bbc comedy\" suspects were wheeled out to ham it up. \"bend it like beckham\" had far better comic acting (and serious acting, in fact) than this, with a virtually unknown cast. in summary, a lazy cliched script, over acted, in a dull predictable story. give it a miss.',\n"," 'yes, it feels, and for the most part plays like an \"after school special\", for a slightly more adult audience, alright maybe a teen audience. but add in bill murray (already showing some dramatic as well as his usual comedic talent), a nice supporting cast, and an unexpected sweetness about growing up, and remembering those great, or not so great days at summer camp, and you get a heartwarming, funny, sleeper hit. it does get a little too smarmy for its own good, but that is also one of its charms. when you hear the title \"meatballs\", and see the poster, you expect a teenage sex romp, but what you get is a sentamental, yet sometimes sexy look back at those formative years at summer camp. the sentamentality, and the remberances of simpler times reminds me of \"a christmas story\", which i also love. the rememberances of summer camp were never so well stated. the only movie i have seen that comes close, is \"indian summer\", which i like almost as much as \"meatballs\", and also stars matt craven. let\\'s hope he completes the trilogy. maybe he could come back for \"return of the meatballs\", and bring some dignity back to the franchise (meatballs 2 through 4 bare no resemblence to the original classic). \"meatballs\" is easily on my top 10 guilty pleasures of all time (not really guilty either). it\\'s a wonderful little film, that always makes me smile.',\n"," 'the cast (except for paul bailey) was excellent, especially steven

am giving this a ten out of ten for the acting and the adaptation for film. not the plot. i was disappointed with the ending of the plot of the book, and naturally, the film follows that plot. the

this screen writing thing. he's no good at it and his sense of story and dialog are an insult to anyone over six years old, make that four years old; i know some six year olds who could put together a better story than this. i am actually a fan of dennis quaid, can not imagine what got him into this project. maybe he was drugged and forced to do it. and of course none of this would have been possible without the steady hand and crystal vision of jonas akerlund, holding the wheel as he sailed this turkey right into the rocks. i guess directing the madonna and metallica videos will not

intent on stopping the marriage between the show\\'s stars, kitty carlisle and carl brisson, as well as starring in the infamous \"sweet marijuana\" number (which was also on a 70s bette midler album). so while the chorus girls shuffle around backstage, bumbling detective victor mclaglen ogles the girls while he tries to solve the backstage murder of an unknown woman. we quickly learn that the maid (dorothy stickney) loves brisson from afar, that the wardrobe lady (jessie ralph) is brisson\\'s mother, and that the stage manager (jack oakie) butts into everything. lots of plots twists among the musical numbers. the show\\'s best-known song is \"cocktails for two.\" kitty carlisle also sings the haunting \"where do they come from?\" and there\\'s a weird rhapsody that erupts into a harlem specialty number featuring duke ellington! quite the cast. some terrific acting here, especially gertrude michael and dorothy stickney. kitty carlisle is quite good as well. brisson is a total zero though. charles middleton plays homer, toby wing plays nancy, donald meek plays the doctor, and also see if you can spot ann sheridan and lucille ball among the show girls.',\n"," 'i love the

would be better in ten. there\\'s like an hour in the middle where he is doing climbing practice on rooftops, and habits in a church tower like quasimodo (only he is much less sympathetic). there\\'s a strange love story involved which does not have anything to do with anything. she happens to look like his mother, yes so what? we know he misses his mother, that\\'s what the first ten minutes were about. they should just have put the beginning and ending together and it would have been a o.k. short film. now it\\'s a portrait of a character who does not change. he is a guy that stuff happens to. the only active choice he has in the whole middle of the movie is to apply for a job. there\\'s this whole oedepus thing going on which is supposed to make us analyze his character. he paints his face, dresses in women\\'s clothing and wears a dead badger on his head. a badger! you have got to see the ending! he returns to his home with the badger on his head (and it is shot like a tacky horror film) to kill his dad\\'s new wife (which he had sex with in the beginning). and somehow they thought this would not be entertaining enough so they put some indie punk music in the background. i have got to admit though, i am kind of allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex on your nose. it feels like this mackenzie director/guy/whatever is trying to show us that he also has been studying psychology in school. you are so smart! thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back into our memories! you really dug! what a wallraff! okay so now i realized this film is based on some random book, but anyway.. photowise it is boring. a lot of talking heads. plus the editor has changed the colors from scene to scene, you know cold and warm etc.. why? maybe \"hallam foe\" is both a feature and a test film for color blind people. or maybe they just thought that the drama would not be enough to tell us that he feels lonely, so they increased blue so that we really get it. i am not even gonna comment on the cliché indie-oh-how-how-how-cute drawings they have made in the presentation. and all the \"cute\" sex stuff going on. this whole film is an independent cliché. but i do recommend it. i laughed more than a few times. though it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crap like this gets through the machine.',\n"," 'some people say steve irwin\\'s larrikin antics and gregarious personality are only an act. watch this film: it\\'s obvious he can not act. steve irwin, dangerman star of the small screen in his *crocodile hunter diaries*, *croc files* and eponymous *crocodile hunter* series (you see a naming trend here, or is it just me?), rockets his larger-than-strife persona to the big screen with *crocodile hunter: collision course* (yup there\\'s a definite trend of words beginning with \\'c\\') - basically an episode of *crocodile hunter* mashed together with a b-movie. on a mission to relocate a big croc to save it from being shot by an eccentric farmer (magda szubanski), steve and wife terri are unaware that the croc is being tracked by american spies (lachy hulme and kenneth ransom), out to recover a spy satellite beacon it has swallowed. will it hurt my credibility to say \"they are on a collision course with wackiness\"? (what credibility? - ed note.) the plot is irrelevant, as it is steve\\'s animal magnetism that propels the film. if you find his persona trying, the film is a failure, but if you are a fan of either him (as a businessman, conservationist or just plain ass-klown) or his television shows, expect more of the same on a wide-screen budget. john stainton, faithful liege, best mate and helmer of the crocodile hunter *oeuvre* (can it be called that with a straight face?), writes and directs with the same provincial swagger that made steve a household wildlife jester. the most jarring aspect of this movie is that steve (one of the few people for whom you can actually hear the exclamation points going by as he speaks) and terri (steve\\'s spouse of 10 years, fiercest ally and closest friend) treat it like it is one of their documentaries, breaking the \"fourth wall\" and speaking directly to the camera, whilst all the other characters behave as if they are in a bad movie (well ). it would not be so incongruous if steve and terri were kept separated from the rest of the characters but when the bad americans constantly threaten steve\\'s life, we confused viewers must ask ourselves why the indifferent camera crew does not at least call the cops if not try to poke the bad guys in the eye with the boom mics, or run screaming into the bush anything but continue filming casually with great lighting, crisp audio and seven action angles. while terri is unfairly painted as steve\\'s mildly incompetent sidekick (her acting consists of boldly inept line reads and gadding about in pear-shaped-buttock-hugging jeans - for the last, i am not complaining), steve goes about his business-as-usual of show-and-tell with creatures intent on killing him, doing all his stunts himself because, well, to him they are not really stunts, just a day at the office. of course, watching this madman\\'s koo-koo adventures after his tragic death in september 2006 casts a strange detachment over the proceedings. but to those of us who never met him, this kind of malarkey (as well as various incarnations of the *crocodile hunter* series in constant re-runs) keeps him as alive as ever in our crocodile burrows. the wrenching reality of his absence will only be apparent to those nearest him. and i truly wish them the best in following in his outsize footprints so enjoy this diversion for what it is a half-baked movie featuring a full-on legend. he died doing what he loved interacting with wildlife - and he could never have asked for more of his first feature film in portraying him doing just that. (movie maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)',\n"," 'i can not think of a more prevalent example of misguided trailers then ang lee\\'s new piece lust, caution. i was anticipating a tale of romance and seduction between an older man and his mistress within japanese occupied china. wow, was that not even close. true those aspects are there, but the real story is so much more involved, stimulating, and unexpected. after following his last chinese language film crouching tiger, hidden dragon with two english language works, it is nice to see lee go back to his native tongue. i enjoyed both hulk and brokeback mountain for what they were, but neither touched his martial arts epic in terms of scope or success. when hearing about lust, caution, i was very much excited to see what he would do with it. looking more like a wong kar wai movie, (not sure i have the credibility to make that statement seeing as i have only seen the gorgeous in the mood for love), i was hoping to get a sense of the character pieces he had done early in his career that i have not yet been able to view. if there is one thing that stays consistent through the works i have seen, it is his wonderful use of cinematography. with cameraman rodrigo prieto, (a man who has filmed works by favorites of mine iñárritu and cuarón), behind the lens, one could not expect less. after working with lee on brokeback mountain, he once again shoots some stunning work. the framing is always perfect, many scenes use mirrors and glass to keep all the action on screen simultaneously, and the sexual encounters are displayed with the right amount of care and brutality necessary to get the point across on what is happening. this is one sticking point that has been gaining a lot of press around the movie. does it deserve the nc-17 rating here in the us? maybe. nothing is more graphic than say hbo\\'s new series \"tell me you love me,\" yet it is more integral to the story. many of the instances are pretty much rape, and that is something one should know going into it, in case it will deter your wanting to view the movie. however, the overall impact of what happens would not be even close to what it is had those moments been excised or edited. the sex between our two leads is the bond that connects them beyond the jobs they are doing. that physicality is what makes the final third of the film as heartbreaking as it is. as i said before, though, lust, caution is not about the love affair been characters played by the great tony leung and startling newcomer wei tang. what we really have set before us is a tale of revolution, espionage, and maturing within the confines of a world at war. tang is just a kid who finds herself the new star actress at her school. the theatre troupe she works with decides that they should do what they can for the resistance, which they are unable to fight in. after its director, played nicely by lee-hom wang, has a chance encounter with an old friend, the troupe gets to the cusp of a dangerous situation. they soon find themselves way over their heads, trying to orchestrate an assassination of a chinese man working with the japanese as a traitor to his country. when the event that shows the culmination of their age and inexperience plays out, it is both unexpected and unavoidable. either way, though, they have embedded themselves into the guerilla war and eventually find that they had no chance to turn back. meeting four years previous to the film\\'s conclusion at the back of their college theatre sealed their futures. while at its core we are given a story very similar to last year\\'s foreign sensation of espionage, the lives of others, it is shown very differently. lee allows the story breathing room to ferment and go its course. each \"spy\" grows up so much during the four year span of the film. between the main two, tang and wang, along with leung\\'s traitorous, political general, the evolution of each is shown in its entirety. all three\\'s motivations are clearly laid out and during the almost three hour runtime, the audience cannot become lost because they are shown absolutely everything. so, rather than build extreme tension between two people, like in the german film, lee allows for a slow construction of backstory and relationship with all involved. all our principals grow together or apart based on what they allow themselves to do for the \"good of their nation.\" no matter how good the story itself, the film would be nothing without its magnificent acting. it is tang and leung that carry the movie. with so many moments of silent expression between them and some tough to stomach scenes in bed, these two amaze. the emotions are always prevalent and the decisions they make never stray from character. yes, their relationship is unconventional, but the bond they forge cannot be taken lightly. while the middle portion might seem a bit long and monotonous to a point, the finale is a feat of genius. from tang and wang\\'s final look into each other\\'s eyes and leung\\'s reaction to the clock\\'s strike of ten, all you can think is how lee let this story be told as it should. so, i guess while i chided the industry for their almost suicidal handling of foreign films, i do need to give them some credit for still letting us americans, who do not mind reading subtitles, view them in their unedited glory. (well at least some times, if this was a no name director and not lee, i would not have been surprised if the producers changed the ending and shaved an hour off.)',\n"," \"not a lot here in the genre of city boys wandering into hillbilly country. all the cliché's are here, but this movie takes itself too seriously as a scary movie which it is not. as a b movie its not campy enough and as a thriller it fails miserably. for hysterical laughs i would recommend redneck zombies made on 100th of the budget and better cheesy gore effects. if you want a serious well made movie which this one is grafted from,deliverance is the gold standard and southern comfort comes in a close second. a newer movie, wrong turn has done this premise again and is also well made. if this movie would have exploited itself as redneck zombies did it might have been better.\",\n"," '\"the thing about my folks\" came in as a surprise. we had no idea about what to expect. the film directed by raymond defelitta, and based on a screen play by one of its stars, paul reiser, proved to be a pleasant time at the movies. although the film is predictable and we know what will be the outcome, this is a voyage of discovery where ben gets to know his father, perhaps for the first time in his life, ben sees his father for what he really is, and not the mythical figure he has in his mind. the film seems to be a vehicle for its star, peter falk, and he runs away with the movie, as it was expected. mr. falk, one of the most endearing actors working in movies in this era and in past years, is an actor of such stature, he must be reckoned with. as sam kleinman, the distant father to ben, he is a man that clearly is misunderstood, not only by ben, but it appears by the whole family and his wife of forty-seven years. when muriel, the matriarch of the kleinman clan, runs away, everyone goes into a panic because this woman, who has been the strong figure of the family, is vital to keep everyone together. not knowing where she has gone, sam shows up at ben\\'s house confused as he feels abandoned, suddenly, by the woman he married and has been faithful for all those years. ben, the youngest son, takes his father on a trip to look for a house he wants to buy so he can get his own family out of manhattan into the country. the trip provides the excuse for ben to bond with his father in ways he never knew about because the old man had always projected an aloof figure to his younger son. along the way, father and son realize how much they love one another and how misunderstood the old man has been by his children. the love of sam for muriel spans the many years they have known one another; they seem inseparable. peter falk is magnificent in the film. he makes an excellent sam kleinman, the man who suddenly realizes his life is about to change for the worst. mr. falk shines as the older man and there\\'s never a false movement in his interpretation of the man whose whole world is crumbling under him. not being a paul reiser fan, we must confess that as ben kleinman, he is right. ben and his father discover how much in common they both have and their love for muriel, the mother that has sacrificed her life in order to keep the family together. olympia dukakis is only seen at the end of the film. she makes a good contribution as the fleeing mother. elizabeth perkins plays rachel with great style.. the film has a beautiful look thanks to the cinematography of dan gillham, and the excellent musical score by steven argila. ultimately, the film shows a great team effort between its director, mr. defelitta and paul reiser who wrote it for the screen. although this film is clearly targeted for an older audience, it should please anyone.',\n"," 'an excellent example of what happens when one central body controls everyone. i liked this movie because glenn corbett also appeared in star trek as zeffrem cochrane in 1967. i also liked it because i am a fan of the apollo space program.',\n"," \"i rented this movie the other day b/c i love romance stories, but this has got to be the worst one i have ever seen in my life. i find it hard to believe that sam would fall in love with kelley after they have said hardly no more than 2 words to each other when she has a great long-time boyfriend who's devoted to her completely. i thought kelley was a major jerk throughout the movie, and he never changed at all. the only good thing about the movie was josh hartnett. i thought he did a wonderful acting job, and i am going to start watching more movies of his.\",\n"," \"all this show is, is the same plot. kuszko (spelling?) is in danger of failing school, he needs to pass to become emperor. he needs to learn something, which he thinks is stupid, he then uses it/ learns more about it and realizes it's not so stupid. eezma, posing as the principal, tries to transform kuszko into some animal to stop him. every episode. jokes from the movie are copied (eezma's incredibly complicated plans, kuszko breaking the 4th wall constantly, squirrels.) they should try hiring some writers. 2/10\",\n"," 'few films will have you come away feeling as sick as i did from suburban mayhem, a putrid and quite vile film about despicable people doing despicable things to one another for the sake of daft entertainment. the film is bad, in that depressing and sickening manner that certain \\'bad\\' films are. this is no guilty pleasure and this certainly is not a study of anything remotely interesting despite the clear intentions it has. what else can you say about a film that brutally murders off the one, decent character whom tries to help others and then resorts to having its lead characters conform to horrific acts of animal cruelty for good measure? the film centers on a female youth named katrina (barclay) and like the hurricane of her namesake, this little monster whirls bucket loads of chaos as she whirls around the general area causing havoc. katrina has achieved what little ambition she has very early on in the film: her face on newspapers and her figure on television it\\'s a celebrity status through horrific acts that someone like charles manson might know all about but the thing that\\'s more agitating is its obvious reek of natural born killers and how suburban mayhem uses the distorted television perspective complete with \\'the guilty\\' speaking into a camera in a mock interview set up is not that a clicé yet? if not, why not i hate the convention and i hate how it makes people that do it feel clever because it \\'breaks the fourth wall\\' and that\\'s so \\'out there\\' when it comes to mainstream cinema. you are not fooling anyone. so the film revolves around katrina and we see her story told to us in flashback format. now, the term anti-hero is one that springs to mind here but i am not going to apply it to katrina because she (as does the film overall) does not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as the term. an anti-hero is someone who is not quite on the level of \\'good\\' but knows what they want and we feel a guilty urge to want them to win, even if it clashes with our own moral codes. here, katrina has a child, a child that she neglects and ignores in a couple of scenes that are just disturbing in her ruthlessness. her father, john (morgan), threatens to have the child taken away unless she sorts out her drug plagued; mischief plagued and crime plagued life. but she cannot have that and enters femme fatale mode to seduce a local nut-case named kenny (hayes) into killing her father for her. i do not think anyone in their right minds is going to want katrina to get away with this. the film\\'s draw is a question that doubles up as its own hypothesis: \"can you really get away with murder?\" thus tempting us to watch to see if someone actually might. well, unless you are jack the ripper in 19th century, or whenever it was, britain no, you can not. the question the writers and co. should have asked one another in a filmic sense is: \"should you really be able to get away with murder?\" this is what they fail to spot by the time katrina is just about home free and documenting to us her story from the confines of the future. if the film is so interested in the quirky delivery of the study of achieving celebrity fame through infamy then natural born killers sets the bar and van sant\\'s \\'to die for\\' is sub-natural born killers; and scott\\'s \\'domino\\' is sub-to die for which means this film is sub-domino, which is really scraping the bottom of the barrel given how much i hated domino. so the \\'anti-hero\\' on this occasion is not someone who will force us into questioning our own moral codes as much as she will force us to pray that she dies a slow death not too far into the film\\'s beginning. the drug taking; threatening innocents at home; baby rejecting disaster that is katrina struts about and moves into seducing kenny for her own dirty work; we are not amused and we are not enthralled and we cannot believe what we are seeing. these days, the idea of becoming an overnight success for young people is, arguably, at its peak what with the extensive reality tv shows and so forth. i only pray this film be seen by as few as these young people as possible because in the end, the film is a glorification of a young girl who has attained celebrity status through things like pregnancy and getting caught up in a murder plot and what-not. what alarms me is that, here in britain, the film was classed as a \\'15\\' certificate meaning most any teenager can access it. i felt dirty when i watched suburban mayhem. the film is misjudged in its overall delivery and presentation of its ideas; a fun, fast and frenetic series of scenes that revolve around trench-coat wearing hermits being told to kill people on the promise of an easy lay from someone we are supposed to be gunning for. if you want a more mature look at working class life in australia, as made by the australians, i recommend 2005\\'s \\'peaches\\' but suburban mayhem is a messy and childish exercise best viewed by as few people as possible.',\n"," 'we brought this film as a joke for a friend, and could of been our worst joke to play. the film is barely watchable, and the acting is dire. the worst child actor ever used and hasslehoff giving a substandard performance. the plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on. it tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable. just terrible',\n"," 'this is a horrible film. its nothing like the karate kid except that it has a kid in it who knows karate. the plot is paper thin, the acting is cardboard (corey feldman included) and character development consists of good guys in white, bad guys in red. the whole film takes itself far too seriously and this is especially evident anytime the overly dramatic soundtrack ques in (good example being the very serious sounding synth music being played during a food fight in a school cafeteria as students smile on). the way the film plays out it feels like they are making it up on the spot. even the action is boring and safe feeling. do not waste your time.',\n"," 'dragon ma (jackie chan)is back, having rid the seas of the dreaded pirate lo. back on land, he is assigned to the police force, where he is to clean up corruption and crime in a local suburb. along the way, he is caught up in the fate of several chinese patriots attempting to secure sympathy and support for their revolutionary cause. the chinese manchu government is after these revolutionaries, and anyone that stands in their way is in trouble, even if they are in the police force. i had big expectations for this movie after i saw project a. but sadly i was a little disappointed. there is just too little action compared to the first film. there is just one good fight scene until the big ending. that fight scene is in the \"gangsters place\" and its good, a lot of people flying all over the place and hard kicks and punches are throw. jackie chan and his stunt team do not disappoint here at all. the ending is very entertaining, jackie chan shows us why he is the best stuntman in the world. really exciting stuff! the only bad thing with the ending, is that the fights are too short and forgettable. conclusion: many funny moments, good acting and crazy stunts. but not enough fighting for a top rating.',\n"," 'the bold thief max burdett (pierce brosnan) retires with his girlfriend lola cirillo (salma hayek) in a paradisiacal island after stealing an expensive diamond. stanley lloyd (woody harrelson), the fbi agent assigned to protect the stolen stone, chases max expecting him to try to robber a valuable diamond in a passenger ship and commit a mistake. \"after the sunset\" is a forgettable but attractive movie: the screenplay is full of plot points, the locations are wonderful;

(just read some professional reviews on the internet, and they\\'ll only mention two ones--the \\'39 and \\'95). perhaps that\\'s because quite a few have not read the novel, or just because it\\'s a classic, dismiss it as \"boring\" and \"irrelevant\" to today\\'s society. but for those of us who have read the novel and loved it, this is by far the best movie of \"the little princess\" made. it does not rely on special effect interludes, like the \\'95 one, or cute little song and dance sessions like movie of \\'39. here we just get the story as it is with all the characters presented in exactly the way the novel depicts them. amelia shankley did a wonderful job as sara crewe. she looked dark, thin and solemn, just as described in the novel, and acted quiet and wise as well. in fact, all the actors and actresses did a good job. even if lottie did not look quite the way as described, she acted it out so well that it did not matter at all. and that goes for everybody else who\\'s in this. i watched this with my mother and she agreed that it was very well done, and that all the children were quite appealing. as well, the sets and costumes were not too bold, like in the \\'95 version (can you tell i did not like that one?). sara\\'s surroundings are supposed to look drab and grey. if you have never seen a version of \"the little princess\" or read the book--obviously read the novel first, then see this one. but if the thought of frances hodgson burnett\\'s lovely story does not appeal to you, then by all means, see the others. in general, i love bbc productions of novels, because of their faithfulness to the original stories, and because of their length.

'from the comments i saw here, i thought i was about to see one of those rare, forgotten comedic gems, the cast definitely offered hope. however, this was disappointing, there were a couple of good one-liners but this was more a drama than a comedy and a drama that seemed to drag and drag. apart from fox and douglas, everyone else was one-dimensional and seemed to be saying the same stuff over and over again. there was real scope here for a wittier script, instead it all got rather tedious, 30 minutes could easily have been lopped off the running time. at least it was good to see actors

one way or another from the stores. now to tortu^^ test the resolve of these new staff members, we would issue them with a copy of going overboard. we had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of goodmans dvd player that had this film as a free gift, got round to sending their dvd player back, they never failed to send shecky back also. our

the 106 minutes of it. at first, the movie seemingly revolves around a young woman who kills mercilessly for justice. however, as the story continues, her actions became methodical and preempted. only at the very end of the story do we actually get to know the angst, grief and pain that forced her into such a state of mind. this movie, although korean, also reflects on the other asian societies

sequence. and the agents clearly could not just ignore it all, they would have to look into it at some point, and the episode ends so early that we do not get to see what they find out. i get the sense that they might have run out of time while making this episode and had to cut things out, since a lot of plot threads are abandoned. and aside from this episode, the x-files normally seems to cater to the curious type of audience that wants to actually find out what\\'s going on. it is an investigation show after all. i wish this was a \"to be continued\" episode, because as much as i hate

he looked older so the story was less believable. in real life, the men murphy served with gave him a hard time because he looked like a kid. the older murphy in the movie did not look inexperienced, innocent, scared, or young enough. murphy was too mature to play himself a decade later. the point of the movie was how a kid became a military leader in the army. however, the story is still good.

rolling your eyes with disbelief). it\\'s the old psychopath on a train story but that is of no big importance as the thriller portion of the film almost seems to be merely a counterweight to the antics of the great comedian robert gustafsson. his hapless, nearly incurably optimistic soldier invokes both compassion and schadenfreude in a fashion that almost rivals chevy chase. the thing about the film that appealed to me the most, however, is that wedged between the improbable and the hilarious are the accurately portrayed everyday joys and nuisances of train travel. they add a most welcome sense of realism and recognition. this thriller comedy has admittedly borrowed most of its \"suspense\" from hitchcock and should, in my opinion, only be watched for its comedy value (which is high indeed). besides gustafsson, lars amble\\'s solid performance as a delightfully cynical misogynist is worth the price of admission alone. heartily recommend.',\n"," \"i went into this movie with

broker to serial killer. the film has no-name actors, and i can see why, after watching the movie, i can not see why any actor with a career would want to even be involved in this movie. anyone who

unsatisfying and disappointing to watch. the first 20 minutes or so actually promised a lot and i was intrigued. the central protagonist had a peculiar lack of lines and the college girls venomous retort after his first unwanted advance made you wonder who was really the bad guy. however this all started to change in the contrived and unconvincing way in which she was coerced into prostitution. she lost her backbone, she spent more time sobbing and several inexplicable plot holes creep into the story. an unconvincing time distortion (for want of better words) works it's way into the story that i felt took away from the plot instead of adding depth to it. the writer may have been trying to be metaphorical, but in the context of the rest of the film, it was just out of place. and finally, the central characters silence i believe hamstrings the movie, unlike in a kevin smith movie where when silent bob speaks, actually has something profound to say. by the end of the movie, i could not care for either the girl or the main character and the ending neither seemed appropriate nor inappropriate for them. i simply did not care for them... let alone despise them.\",\n"," \"it

limited thrills or even decent writing. the story centers on a group of friends--two of them being brothers--who return to their uncle's old cabin on some forested island, unaware that it is infested with a pack of vicious dogs that have either contracted a furious case of rabies or have escaped a genetic experiment (the writers seem to have a hard time deciding on which they'd rather go with, despite the stupidity in character's reasoning for the former). and that is essentially what the eighty some minutes of screen time boils down to--escaping the dogs. and of course, all that follows is

laugh because the acting is rather wooden, and the production values are very 1970s. however, when we get to the interaction between jane and rochester, it comes alive and i forgot the datedness of the production. the dialogue is straight out of the book, and in some places this makes it unrealistic and cumbersome, but the narration in jane's voice is wonderful, because it lets us know what she in thinking. other productions have not done this, and sometimes it's useful to know why she acts as she does. the developing love between jane and rochester and the enduring nature of that love is

feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out. shot on a micro budget of $6,000 this is a student film with real class. the film is shot in black and white, and features people who you

unfortunately they have not since this was made 6 years ago. nolan's thriller, much like memento, does not play chronologically, it shifts the scenes around much like pulp fiction. the writing is fantastic. it is a great twisting thriller but because the temporal order of the film is shifted around it makes it even more interesting. i thought the last ten minutes in particular when everything starts to become clear were excellent. for a film of such a small budget and with no recognizable names at all, this is so good. it is superior to most that hollywood studios offer and nolan after three films (this, the superior memento and the not quite as good but still excellent insomnia) has cemented himself as the most exciting new talent of recent times. i can not wait for batman. this film is short and sweet and certainly a great watch. it is very professional and the twists are fantastic and completely surprising. i also thought that the score from david julyan was also excellent,

josie gellar is a sweet, extremely sappy and sometimes quite painful tale of a timid woman named josie gellar who though brilliant is quiet and shy and has never been kissed by a man. she is assigned her first major news story for the newspaper she works for-to go undercover as a high school student befriend the popular cool kids and get a scoop as to what really goes on in the world of high school. only problem is josie has never been popular. high school was in fact, a traumatizing experience for her as she was the recipient of quite a lot of teasing and cruel jokes. josie grabs this assignment, as much to finally \"fit in\" as to get a scoop-what she finds is the major premise of the story. never been kissed is one of those movies that\\'s so sappy and schmaltzy at times, particularly in a few scenes at the end that the limits of believability are sorely tested and many a cynic may not like this movie. it is however, very sweetly done. drew barymore is perfect as the bumbling yet lovely josie-she breathes a breath of fresh air into the character and makes her appear perfectly realistic. i also enjoyed leelee sobiesky as the intellectual student who befriends josie on her first day at the school. never been kissed has some really funny moments as josie unravels in her frantic efforts to be cool. example-the reggae bar scene.i also loved the appearance of josie\\'s brother rob who also goes back and signs up as a high school student, the way that he helps to give josie her \"dream\" of finally fitting in is just hilarious. at the same time, as josie\\'s woeful story of her original years in high school are shown in flashback it is extremely painful. you do not need to have had similar experiences in high school to josie to be affected by her story-drew is wonderful at making her character have a personal connection with the audience and we adore josie from the beginning. there is a lot of \"mean girls\" a 2004 release, in this movie but mean girls honestly was a lot grittier. never been kissed becomes very much a romantic pic as josie develops feelings for a certain man and the question becomes will they get together. i liked this movie. it was really beautifully done in some areas. the movie is corny in some places yes, the last scene-realistic-no way-does this movie manipulate your emotions in the most obvious hollywood way? oh yeah yeah yeah baby! but it manipulates beautifully, there are some lessons to be learned here. the movie never preaches but manages to paint an accurate picture of what high school was like for a select few. i have actually met people who have had similar experiences to josie-i have met people very much like all these characters-i think a lot of people simply do not know or can not conceive of the cruelty that can exist in the world of high school, and how hurtful it can be, but it\\'s there. not unrealistic at all. what struck me was drew\\'s speech at the prom, as she demonstrates the \"sheep mentality\" that can exist so prevalently -as hollywood and manufactured as many think that may be, it was well done and very true. i am making never been kissed sound a lot

emotional interaction between likable and interesting characters.. dawn of the dead even ended well, paving the way for an intense sequel with a spoiler sneak peak of what's to come for the characters at the end of the movie. day of the dead is not that sequel. day of the dead is almost laughably terrible. the acting is shallow and boring at best. yes, ving rhames is in this, but somehow the producers managed to make ving look amateurish and uncomfortable. not only is ving not the same character as he was in dawn of the dead but then they had the audacity to kill him off with the first thirty minutes and turn him into a pathetic, eye-eating, legless zombie. the zombies look fake and in no way menacing. the editing is sloppy and choppy and quite frankly, by the end of the movie i was really just hoping to see all of the unintelligent main characters end up zombie feed. the only thing that saved this movie from making me really angry was the fact that i had it recorded it on dvr and i could fast forward through most of it and then have the satisfaction of hitting 'delete' when it was over. do not waste your time. try again steve miner and jeffrey reddick.\",\n"," 'since

and heavily used parts of this for the game resident evil. for example; replace albert wesker from r.e. with barry bostwick, the tyrant with a metal werewolf and keep the main characters pretty much the same. the way barry bostwick dies is the same way albert dies and the same for the werewolf dying just like the tyrant. the story simply goes like this; in 1974, the us military goes into the carpathian forest to find a werewolf to get it's blood and use it's dna to create the ultimate biological weapon(like resident evil again)but one of the men gets too cocky and takes the blood himself and all hell breaks loose (close enough to re to mention it again). barry bostwick manages to take down and put the cocky werewolf guy in deep freeze until 20 years later when technology has advanced enough to resume the project. of course, the werewolf gets loose again and causes havoc again or else there would not be a movie. it was entertaining and had some really good special effects.

there were only two billion people wanting it. \"civilization\" has only ever had one answer for that kind of problem. the thin thread that \"a crude awakening\" seems to hang its optimism on is the

less moralistic tone. murer clearly has a great rapport with children and brings out a credible performance from the nonprofessional actor (but real-life musical virtuoso) teo gheorghiu -- especially considering that so much of the film rests on this young pianist's shoulders. bruno ganz, whom english-speaking audiences rarely get to hear performing in his own zurich dialect, unsentimentally

well-written and well-acted, featuring a veritable `who's who' of then slightly unknown actors such as ed harris, dennis quaid, sam shepard, scott glenn and lance henriksen. while it had an over three hour running time, and i actually had to get up to turn over the dvd because of its length, the pacing was such that i never once considered that any particular scene should have been shortened. one thing i particularly enjoyed about the film was the introduction of chuck yeager (shepard) and his contribution to history by breaking the sound barrier, and then the periodic simultaneous comparison of the accomplishments of the astronauts and the air force and civilian test pilots, as well as exhibiting their eventual mutual respect. if i had to point out any kind of glaring fault, it would have to be that they focused on some astronauts more than others obviously concentrating heavily on the bigger names, and glossing over the `lesser-known' ones. an example would be walter schirra (henriksen) his name is mentioned a couple of times, and he probably had a tenth of the screen time of the others. plainly, with an already three hour running time not everyone could have equal time, so this is certainly a mild criticism. `the right stuff' is not profound or exceptional, but it is certainly a good and interesting film. --shelly\",\n"," 'surprisingly well-acted, well-written movie about hard rockin\\'-but-decent young man getting that much-hoped-for ticket to stardom: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer. not far-fetched, the film tries keeping things in perspective and does not go over-the-top; it certainly makes you think twice about those lingering adolescent fantasies about being in the music business. but the script, despite solid dialogue, follows a tried-and-true, formulaic pattern, and gets bogged down by its own clichés in the final act. i enjoyed it much more than the sugary fluffball \"almost famous\". it has a nice, bitter edge to go with its heavy metal decadence, but a stronger finish might\\'ve made it more memorable. **1/2 from **',\n"," \"when i first heard about moon child, i thought it was a joke. after a few months, i figured i guess it's for real. the few reviews i read that were not made by squealing fangirls were not very promising. when i was given the opportunity to watch it, i was fully prepared to groan, wince, and otherwise need to close my eyes to avoid the silliness. i was more than a little surprised, and in a good way. yes, moon child has its moments of cheese, camp, and general dorkiness -- i think that's kind of impossible to avoid when it involves gackt camui, a man not known for his sanity -- but all in all, it was wholly enjoyable. no, it is not a work of cinema genius but it is very, very heartfelt, amusing, with fun choreography, a touching score, and a fun cast. i know little of japanese cinema so i can not really judge the acting but considering the fact that the cast was speaking a language or extreme dialect foreign to them at one time or another and that a couple of them have almost no acting experience, i was rather impressed. if you can enjoy a good action movie, a good drama, a good comedy, see this film. at least rent it since it's coming to region 1. on a side note, there is zero homosexual/homoerotic content in this film. i did not even see

rely on kids wb and 4kids entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies. as far as the series goes, they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the japanese versions to television. so what is their problem when it comes to the movies? honestly now, i have seen all three pokémon movies in japanese and i will definitely be seeing the fourth one. they are excellent movies. they are all enjoyable and fun to watch. and, after seeing pokémon 2000 in theaters, i can not help but wonder how these american producers read the japanese scripts. the way it appears, it seems that they read and see something that says `insert empty moral here' in big bold faced letters. it definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on msb (extreme sarcasm there) and created this crap. *possible spoilers from here on* well, i guess i should first talk about pikachu's rescue adventure. my first gripe with this came with no narration. i guess they got enough bad comments on the pokédex narration that plagued pikachu's vacation, and, instead of going with a caring, gentle woman's voice as appeared in pikachu no natsu yasumi and pikachu tankentai, they just cut the narration all together. this would not have been a problem, except for one thing. did anyone really understand why the exeggcute did not let togepi go until the end? possibly the fans, but i am sure not the parents. then, there's the theme song. i could not help but roll my eyes at this one. the japanese theme song was `tankentai wo tsukurou' and was sung by japanese children. it was fun and enjoyable. this one: nauseating. now, one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing kireihana. nice music, fun to watch. that's changed with the bellossom. the music sucked for one, but on top of that, they had all the pokémon talk during the music, which turned out to be jumpy, annoying, and just unnecessary. oh, and then there's the poliwhirl who thinks he's a poliwrath. you'd think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are. basically, not much could save this little ill fated dub, which is very unfortunate considering its potential. but, i have not touched on the worst of it yet. you'd think that the warning signs would have been apparent to me when i received my issue of nintendo power. for some unfathomable reason, i had been placing some faith in 4kids and the wb. my thoughts were `well, they screwed up on the first movie, but the second is different as far as the theme goes, so they should do well.' that in mind, i just did not pay attention to the warning signs i encountered in the theaters when the trailers said, `you will believe that one person can make all the difference.' with the way they said that at every turn, i was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like msb did at the end of the english version. then comes nintendo power, in which i see all my fears realized in the words `the main feature 'the power of one.' at that point, i became a bit more uneasy. `the power of one?!' not a good sign. however, i still kept some of my false faith. big mistake. sitting in the theater, i was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which i loved in japanese being turned into complete and utter junk. i hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle. i can see a point in that since they did not pander this thing, repeating it over and over like in msb. however, it did more damage than anything else in this movie. first of all, the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read `the world turns to ash.' ah hah. so, ash is the chosen one? whatever. in the japanese version, the inhabitants of arshia needed a pokémon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony. this time, he's the chosen one. a greater way that this did damage was to lugia. lugia was one of the coolest characters in a pokémon movie... when the movie was about lugia. in this one, lugia is forced to take a back seat to ash. in the scene where they are flying back to the main island, lugia and ash are discussing the conditions of lugia's existence, not that ash is going to make all the difference. overall in this category, ash was not really the `one person' that would make the difference, since he was helped by many along the way. a lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking. furura's flute song was not nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the japanese one. jirarudan's speech to them saying his collection `started with a mew card?' ugh. even worse, misty's outrage originally concerned the way moltres and zapdos were being held. `why did not you put them in pokéballs when you caught them? this is like caging them to be displayed.' much different from whining about him thinking pokémon are things to be collected like stamps. if there were any real redeeming values in this, they came from team rocket. some pretty funny lines. not really to make me laugh out loud, but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach. well, that was officially the last american pokémon movie i am going to see. i have imported the third one and find it very enjoyable. i would rather not see another japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two. i'll be importing the fourth one as well. forget you, kids wb and 4kids. you have forsaken me for the last time.\",\n"," \"this first (and hopefully not last) wallace & gromit feature lives up to expectations. there are plenty of

mission behind enemy lines that is neither convincing nor exciting. the gimmick that the heroes rely on to deliver the explosives is the best idea in this lackluster adventure opus. this 77-minute melodrama spends its opening 14 minutes providing exposition to set up its plot. during that opening quarter hour, we are treated to an \"untouchables\" style narrator and loads of second-unit shots mixed in with artwork and stock footage. we see a german e-boator what passes for oneoff the french command intercept french radio signals. a fight between two agents ensues over possession of the toxin and the vial crashes into the floor and releases a nasty plume of smoke. the allied agent suffers terribly while the german escapes. eventually, doctors in england treat the allied agent but he our brash, fun-loving heroes parachute into france. actually, selleck\\'s character boots whitmore out of the plane and follows him down. a colorful band of traveling gypsies picks them up and serves as their cover during the trip to the winery. our heroes have no money to pay for their escort so the gypsies appropriate selleck\\'s west point ringyeah, right, what was he thinking when he brought it on this missionand whitmore\\'s watch. little do they know that the germans are racing ahead of them for the same destination. perennial bad guy albert paulson commands the axis intruders as a german colonel. selleck masquerades as a german officer in order to enter the grounds of the winery. whitmore taps into the communications line and calls ahead to german headquarters in the winery and inquires about an officer. the radio operator reports that no such officer is available. whitmore complains that he should be notified to report back to him as soon as possible. this clever ruse helps selleck effect entry since the germans are expecting him. he fixes up things so that the plumbing backs up. the german colonel demands that the problem be dealt with in short order. whitmore pretends to be a plumber taking a roadside break when german motorcycle troops discover his presence and escort him to the winery. as it turns out, this is exactly what our heroes want. meantime, the germans discover the gypsies in the woods, but they miss the strong man. he opens the water lines and sends metal tubes streaking through the lines. inside the tubes are explosive devices. after he sends whitmore all the explosive tubes, he drives his wagon off, only to be intercepted by german troops that take him prisoner. in the winery, whitmore enters the vault where the vials of toxin chemicals are stored. before he fiddles with the vials, he slips explosives to selleck who has relieved the guards in front of the vault. selleck and he set their charges and on the way out of the winery, they spot the gypsy father and daughter as well as the germans escorting the strong man in the wagon. the last quarter hour involves their predictable heroics at rescuing the gypsies. whitmore and selleck succeed in their mission and the winery is blown sky-high. the \"untouchables\" narrator furnishes us with a history lesson about the italians declaring war on france and the germans marching on paris. whitmore and selleck play reasonably well off each other, but they are thwarted by embarrassing dialogue, especially when they are voicing themselves over in long shots. veteran tv lenser enzo a. martinelli makes everything look good in this otherwise forgettable fare. among the many anachronisms present here is tom selleck\\'s haircut that was right for the 1970s but all wrong for 1940. i do not think that i have ever seen a german officer with a mustache the size of the one that selleck wears. \"the gypsy warriors\" plays like a world war ii version of the \"the wild, wild west\" with whitmore doing all the dirty work and selleck striking tough guy poses.',\n"," \"i first saw this movie when i was about 10 years old. unfortunately i could not watch it to the end because it was aired late at night. now i bought it on dvd because i can remember that i liked it. this is really not an ordinary horror movie. it has some horror elements but i rather categorize it as fantasy. i liked it but i hoped for a bit more horror and scary scenes. especially the scene when anna's dad comes into the paperhouse trying to kill her is a bit short. now to the plot. this movie is about a young girl named anna who gets ill. while she is ill and has to lie in her bed because of her high fewer she turns on to finishing her drawing about a house - the paperhouse. when she fells a sleep, which often strangely happens just immediately, she finds herself near the house on a big green field. she realizes that the house is exactly like the one she has drawn and that every new detail also appears in her dreams. one day she draws a boy into the house to have somebody to talk to. as she forgets to draw his legs (because he is sitting behind a window) the boy cannot walk. later she is being told by the doctor, that a boy also has this strange disease and she realizes that with the boy she has drawn, she also got that boy into her disturbing dreams. she also notices that it gets harder and harder for her to wake up from her dreams. as she misses her father who is ofter abroad she draws her father into the house. she makes a mistake and her father is looking very angry on the painting. she tries to rubber him out but realizes that she cannot change anything already drawn. and next time she falls asleep the horror begins. her father is mad and blind (because she draw s** on his head to mark him as 'invalid') and tries to get into the paperhouse and kill anna and his friend. her dreams became a horrendous nightmare. they manage to escape and to kill her father and anna can finally wake up. than anna finds her self in the hospital where her parents are sitting beside her bed. the doctors thought that she fell into a coma or so. they tell anna that the other boy died and that they want to travel to the ocean to get over those tragical happenings. anna draws a watchtower and notices that the same watchtower can be found near the hotel they traveled to. she runs to the watchtower and meets the boy (i am just not mentioning his name because i cannot remember it and do not want to go back to the previous html page) and can say good bye to him and forget those terrible dreams forever. there were a few thing i did not understand in the movie. first of all it was the ending which i absolutely dislike. i think it is too long while the main part of the movie becomes a bit too short. how does the boy fly a helicopter and speak to anna as he is supposed to be dead? why did you have to put such a stupid radio on the wall? i hated that scene it was so dumb to me. it almost ruined the main horror scene. things i liked were the scene with the photograph of anna's dad which was the first real scary and horror scene. i liked the boy. the actor was awesome. he was even better than anna. i also liked how anna tries to get her father out of the painting while she is asleep and how she is looking for it in the garbage. overall a good movie. i give it a 8 out of 10.\",\n"," 'i am sorry to say, but hungarian cinema (especially comedies) nowadays is really bad. always the same old \"stars\" play in the \"blockbusters\" telling really bad jokes, but still,

is too cheesy\" well, yes but is not it enjoyable and moving? all right, the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like this does not actually exist. but this is a movie, does not everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while? the next complaint, dicaprio and winslet are terrible actors. well, ok, in this movie, i agree that they do not perform to their full potentials. however i think it\\'s unfair to say that they are terrible actors. i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in. but the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit, but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected. and finally, if one is going to complain that they do not like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then i am sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things. it\\'s like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. simply for being a movie, not because you dislike the genre, this is a good movie. well deserving of its oscars, in particular, best cinematography, which i find to be the best i have ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogy. i know some of the writing fails, such as the constant screaming of each other\\'s names throughout the movie. the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it\\'s an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real, and the sinking feel so epic. i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie, but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea, such as it being a love story, rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed. i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic, including memoirs form the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults. the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper, not steel, and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it. i give this movie 10/10, not

the story buying into it, the production makes it pretty plain that the reason folks are in danger is because of a plague that has infected the island. the attempt to link thea (ellen drew) to malevolent forces did not really work for me, she was just too wholesome and good looking to imply a serious threat. that role should probably have gone to madame kyra, perfect for someone warning about vorvolakas to actually be possessed by one. what works best i guess is the way general pherides (karloff) slowly unravels from a man of strong principal and belief in science to a mad man intent on eliminating a superstition come to life. it's that psychological aspect to the drama that holds more water than the implied horror component, even if mrs. st. aubyn escapes from her coffin. enough explanation revealed her bouts with cataleptic trances and fear of being buried alive to make that an expected part of the story, and one would presume that that was enough to put her over the edge with the old poseidon sword. nevertheless the film is enjoyable on a number of levels; for one, lovers of old films will delight in the great ambiance of an isolated, wind swept island and the dark, moody atmosphere of the albrecht home. the characters never wear out their welcome, and as others on this board have suggested, those that might have make an early exit. be prepared though for a karloff you have not seen before, all the while i just could not get used to seeing him in a military uniform with curly hair.\",\n"," 'most stoogephiles consider this to be the best stooges short bar

not a religious belief? the film never explains any character's motivations, except that everyone either wants to save their country and their president, even on their death bed, or they want to blow up america. it was also flatly directed, attempting some form of style (no wonder it's phil alden robinson's first film in ten years), which only managed to irritate, and still that american

takes place, a small seemingly insignificant event leads to the ultimate demise of all. even though the heist footage is transfixing, it occurs rather early and is ultimately not at the core of the film. this film separates itself from the typical heist movie by giving us insights into the personalities of the characters and their motivations - its plays as much as a drama as it does a thriller. relationships play a big role and a kidnapping is tacked on, giving us two movies for the price of one. john servais plays the idea man tony le stéphanois (always referred to as \"le stéphanois\") with such world-weariness that he could have just stepped out of a camus novel. tony has just recently gotten out of jail and resists re-entering the life of crime until he has a highly unpleasant interaction with his ex-lover (who has taken up with another man) where, as punishment, he physically whips her with a belt. thankfully that scene occurs off camera, but you are not likely to forget it. after that sobering event, since there seems little hope of reviving that relationship, tony meets with two of his old partners in crime, jo and mario, and decides to join them in one last big heist. they enlist the services of cesar, an italian safe cracker - played by director dassin himself - and we are off to the heist. the heist goes off without a hitch. but cesar\\'s womanizing bent is a personality trait that turns out to be fatal for all concerned. however, we can understand his attraction to the nightclub singer he has fallen for, since there is a brilliant set piece where she performs a sexy and cinematically inspired nightclub act - it has to be one of the most memorable scenes from any noir film. it is established early on that tony has a close relationship with jo and his family; in fact jo\\'s son refers to him as uncle. i think it is partly to help jo\\'s family that tony agrees to the heist. the ending scenes, where tony saves the life of jo\\'s kidnapped son, partially redeems his more brutal and amoral actions. but only partially.',\n"," \"i have never understood why so many people seem turned off by this movie. aside from some unnecessary uses of the 's'

ride with basket case, but it did not deliver. everything about this film is bargain--basement, from the acting to the effects. the stop-motion effects are terrible. i realize this is not harryhausen, but low-budget filmmaker brett piper uses stop-motion quite well. the film tells the tale of conjoined twins - one little more than a head growing out of his fully developed brother's right side. his father hires a trio of quack doctors to remove the head, named belial, from the body of the anatomically correct duane. the doctors throw away belial after removing him from duane's side, but duane

immortal michael jordan and his six championships (and finals mvp\\'s) with the chicago bulls. rarely in this generation do people think of the struggling side of chicago, the ghettos, the drug infested streets and life in the urban housing projects during the 1970\\'s. one of television\\'s most formidable shows ever and a groundbreaking sitcom was \"good times\", which i remember vaguely as a small child on cbs, and i enjoy regularly now on tv land. \"good times\" was another norman lear classic, the producer that gave us \"the jeffersons\", the best african american sitcom of all time and \"all in the family\" the greatest show of all time. \"good times\" brought out the hardships of the ghetto and the urban housing projects, and did so with charm, well written and thoughtful plots, and some wonderful acting especially by the matriarch and patriarch of this struggling ghetto family played by esther rolle and john amos. the children in the supporting cast were also pretty good especially the ever popular janet jackson in her early years and ralph carter as florida and james evans youngest son whose character at a young age realizes that life is unfair, and he has to learn to stand on his own two feet. the eldest of the children j.j. played by jimmy walker is somewhat out of place on this show and is there mainly for comic relief. his emotional age is about 11 or 12 even though he looks like a guy in his early twenties. j.j. gets annoying, and it is a credit to the often nasty james evans (amos) that he never tells j.j. to get his own life, get a job and get out of the house. j.j. is an aspiring painter but unlike his younger brother is never serious about getting a college degree, or more important to the family getting a job to help support a household that is just above welfare status. two classic episodes of good times was the one where the janet jackson character is running a fever of 104, and florida evans is desperately seeking good medical help for her can not afford anything but a clinic doctor who is very professional yet does not want to give a family from the projects any more attention than she legally has to. the other episode is the one where james evans can not afford the rent a paltry low $104 a month. the evans are about to get the largest of family setbacks, being thrown out of the projects with no where to go. florida evans goes downtown to the board of social services to try to get either a loan or a grant to help her family. but the government does not consider her family poor because they have over $4,200 in assets for a family of five which is unfairly but unfortunately legally over the poverty line. james and the kids want to hustle for the money, but florida is a person of great moral character and does not want to do anything dishonest no matter how dire their predicament is. in the end the family does find a solution to keep their heads above water. \"good times\" a classic show from the 1970\\'s is about keeping you are head above water in a cruel world. james and florida evans both work hard in menial jobs to try to bring their children up right and avoid the social stigma of welfare. i was too young to understand the message of the sitcom as a toddler in the 70s in its first airing on cbs, but i really enjoy the reruns on tv land in 2006. \"good times\" is one of the

\"first of all, i would like to know why so many people are comparing wyatt earp to tombstone. yes... both films were made within a year apart, but their objectives are completely different. the titles pretty much say it. tombstone is about the events that transpired in tombstone... wyatt earp is about the man wyatt earp. therefore, they do not have the same goal in mind and are telling two very different stories. i enjoyed both films for different reasons and allow them to stand on their own merits. tombstone was more entertaining and action-packed, however, the story was not as historically accurate and the characters were a little over the top. whereas wyatt earp had more of a personal, in-depth examination of the life, but not the legend, of wyatt earp. now, lets get to the intention of this film. wyatt earp is suppose to be a story about the lawman, with the convictions and tribulations that shape him as a young boy up to old age. unlike, tombstone, which focuses on an array of characters with the plot leading up to a single event, quite historically incorrect, i might add. yes... wyatt earp is cold, unforgiving, bitter, reserved, etc. however, he was not always that way, as his early life traveling with his family to california and marriage to urella sutherland, a woman he deeply loved, demonstrates. the turning point in the story is when wyatt's beloved wife dies along with their unborn child. wyatt lashes out and loses all reason to live. he becomes extremely self-destructive and sets about roaming the west with no real purpose at all except to die. his father slaps some sense into him and tells him to move on with his life. eventually, he becomes a lawman and that is when we meet the mysterious and quiet wyatt earp that nobody likes. so... okay... wyatt becomes reserved, quiet, and cruel, but it is not as if we do not know why. he was a man trying to survive in a harsh, brutal land and being a lawman did not make it any easier because he was always a target. he was plagued by external demons as well as internal demons, such as the bottle and a strong yearning, undying love for his dead wife. he was very human and this movie manifests that. tombstone is fine for those of you that do not care for wyatt earp beyond the infamous fight at the ok carroll or the lawman legend. however, if you can stand a more accurate, in depth character exploration of wyatt earp, without any pretensions, than this is a movie worth seeing.\",\n"," \"well wright may have made a gritty depiction of life around 1800 - as he so repeatedly and

pampered woman - they have servants (remember the book scene with the servant dressing the hair, etc)? but wright portrays her with rough reddened skin all down her chest, rough hands and working in the kitchen. and the pigs wandering through! if he wants bucolic, he should try tess. mr bennett - the script makes too cuddly and modern and ignored the weakness in him. the scene where he stops mary playing is supposed to make you cringe - not pass in seconds. if it does not - do not include it. macfadyen is very weak in the part and seems to be doing some kind of pride by numbers acting. the first proposal he looks like a nervous schoolboy rather than a man overcoming his pride to make a proposal beneath his station. most of his lines, he could as well be reading a shopping list. lydia is awful. completely over the top with excessive shrieking and skipping. indeed, knightley plays elizabeth more like the giggling inane character lydia actually is in the book, at times. and elizabeth. half the time knightley is, clearly, mimicking ehle's voice and intonation - close your eyes to see what a copy it is. and in her role you see wright's major error - there is no prejudice. from the first encounter with darcy she clearly fancies him. when he comments to bingley on the attractiveness of the women in the hall she initially looks hurt - not shocked and affronted. the latter should set up the prejudice side of things. and when she and 'caroline' are prancing round the room she comes across like a tease, obviously all over him. and by virtually cutting out wickham you do not get elizabeth invested enough there to set up the prejudicial aspects falling out of that relationship. and apparently it is caroline not miss bingley. and mr bingley happily wanders into jane's bedroom. and and and - wright can boast about how great he is with period all he wants. but a few panorama shots of rural life (which show the preference for hardy) do not excuse him the glaring blunders all over the place. the cinematographer - who clearly wants awards - should have been reined in. he veered between bronte and hardy throughout the film - and was not the last proposal shots/lighting from tess? the need to see darcy walk along through the 'scape with unkempt shirt was just dumb. but most importantly - when going between those 2 very different landscapes they forget the most important one - austen. (she'd have laughed out loud at the elizabeth = sad, therefore = rain, running through to picturesque folly, wet darcy rubbish). i admit i found it impossible the watch the film without using the book as context. i was prepared to give it some leeway as it had to provide the story in a short space of time. but to forget fully one half of the core of the book in prejudice and darcy to continually look more constipated than prideful, made it almost unwatchable. i could only see it as a mess with generally poor performances (when knightley was not aping ehle she was gurning or skipping or both and only calmed down a couple of times to indicate she does have some promise - but faffing about on swings to convey emotion is not a substitute for a poor script and poor direction) - although for some it was simply a case of bad script. tom holland alone would escape censure. while he toned down the comic aspects of collins, he did turn in a very interesting approach. dench does superbly the schtick she can do in her sleep whether it be here or in oscar wilde - but this was supposed to be lady catherine de bourgh not lady bracknell. she was just a little too sane. the shortened length could have been handled by a competent screenwriter, surely? not characters filling in story gaps and helping along the audience all over the place. elizabeth could not have come up with the 10k figure. and while they wanted to cut time with her learning of darcy's involvement in wickhams marriage the lines did not fit with lydia. it was the worst case of incongruous exposition in the piece. it really is appalling stuff. anyone who reviews it saying it works well in the context of the book is someone i frankly do not believe has read or understood the characterisations in the thing. wright seems to think his characters are in the 1990s not the 1709s from their behaviour. i am not convinced he has read the book - he certainly does not understand it. he does not understand austen's acerbic wit or lightness of touch - he certainly made a dull plodding film out of it. what is possibly worse was the sad pathetic need of the chick lit lovers to need the 'i love you, i love yous' all over the place so they can sigh and get off on it. the fact that it has no place in a work by austen is apparently irrelevant. anyone who reviews it as a film alone? well, more difficult for me except i would note the poor acting, the weak darcy, and the gurning skipping inane irritation of the whole thing. if you are going to adapt you can change a lot - but if it loses the spirit and key motivations, then do not insult the book by taking it's title.\",\n"," 'beautiful peggy ann garner, not the plain little girl that played francie in \"a tree grows in brooklyn\" is all grown up and plays the part of a female predator out to get her man in her first drama in living color. she plays the part well with lots of emotion and shows that she is a master of her craft.',\n"," \"without saying how it ended, it is sufficient to say that the whole thing degenerates from about five minutes before the end. if the standard had been maintained throughout, the movie would be worth a seven. one wonders in a way why a woman was added to the cast.

here's one: they build up adam as this super powerful/influential guy and beside the healing ability they do not even explain how, and then he gets easily killed to make room for the next big villain.

that it takes place all in one night, just like halloween ii. when steve and jane are making out, they see a meteor fall from space. inside the meteor is the blob. whenever the blob consumes a person, it grows bigger and bigger. they try to convince the people of the town about the blobby monster, but no one believes them until later. can anything stop this blobby creature? i highly recommend the

effortless movie he has made. the plot revolves around two small-town buffoons amar (aamir khan) and prem (salman khan). they want to get rich quick and so move to the big city. they hatch the same plan separately - to woo a rich heiress raveena (raveena tandon) who is the daughter of a rich businessman ramgopal bajaj (paresh rawal). thus the one who marries raveena gets his hands on all her wealth. but when they get to know each other\\'s plan , there is an intense tussle of one-oneupmanship over who marries raveena. hilarious gags and situations ensue as the battle rages on. at the same time ramgopal bajaj\\'s identical twin brother shyamgopal bajaj wants to eliminate his brother and niece and usurp the family fortune. add to this an assortment of funny characters including a raveena\\'s maid karishma (karishma kapoor) , a mistake-prone butler named robert (vijoo khote) , a manager named bhalla (shehzad khan) who mimics yesteryear\\'s villain ajeet and a funny gangster gogo (shakti kapoor) who looks more like a pirate and a rollicking comedy awaits you. do not waste your time looking for logic in the movie. leave the company of your brains and just enjoy. the actors are so much in sync with the script that no room is left for mistakes. dialogues (rajkumar santoshi , dilip shukla) are witty. music (tushar bhatia) and lyrics (majrooh sultanpuri) are memorable. the picturization and choreography (saroj khan) of \"yeh raat aur yeh doori\" , \"ae lo ji sanam\" and \"dil karta hai tere paas aaoon\" is fitting and will remain etched in my mind forever. the film starred two superstars-in-the-making , aamir khan and salman khan (they eventually became superstars). aamir khan is impeccable in his first all-out comedy role. i salute his sense of comic timing. salman pales in comparison with aamir but is still likable. among the supporting characters , paresh rawal stands out in his dual role of ramgopal and shyamgopal. the movie surprisingly failed at the box office. i fail to understand why. i recommend it to all nevertheless.',\n"," 'this movie clearly was made with an agenda, and that was to depict the south as being a place full of dirt poor,

detroit. the southern people, while often retaining their traditional values of faith in god and a deep mistrust of the government, have largely evolved into a cosmopolitan, technology-driven population. why did this film only focus on rural areas? why did it completely fail to visit houston, dallas, new orleans, atlanta, miami, nashville, or dozens of other places? because the filmmakers

bishof) who recently moved to mexico with his alcoholic mother (helena rojo). it's the night of micheal's birthday & the last few guests are leaving his party, or so he thinks. some of his friends have stayed behind including his best friend tony (juan ignacio aranda) & a girl from school whom he has the hots for named alexandra (gabriela hassle). tony, being an idiot, suggests that they hold a séance with a ouija board he just happens to have, after some goading everyone agrees & the séance begins. tony talks about a spirit named virgil & asks him some stupid questions, everyone goes home & that's about that or so everyone thinks... the next day micheal is late for class but everything is fine. however that night as micheal is trying to sleep he has a vision, a vision of one of his friends named debbie (cecilia tijerina) who was at the séance, being brutally stabbed to death by an unknown assailant. oh, & for some unexplained reason micheal's eye's turn red. at first micheal thinks that it was just a hallucination but when he hears about debbie's death & that of another one of his friends at the séance peter (mario ivan martinez) on the news he becomes convinced that his vision was real. while at school micheal receives a warning in the shape of yet another vision, a warning which tells him christy (melinda mccallum) will be the next to die, micheal must try & save christy & his remaining friends who were present at the séance before this unknown source of evil kills all of them... this mexican american co-production was written & directed by ruben galindo as ruben galindo jr. & is one seriously bad film. the script tries to cross supernatural thriller with stalk 'n' slash horror & it predictably turned out to be a complete mess. do not panic is a painfully slow & tedious film to watch with only two murders for well over an hour of it's running time & lots of boring exposition & unnecessary character development for the rest of it. the dialogue is pretty bad, the acting is very bad & the character's are awful. the film tries to conceal the killer's identity & to be fair it might work, unfortunately the version i saw revealed the killer on the back of the video box so i knew who it was all along, i doubt it would be that much of a surprise though. no explanation is given to who virgil is, what he want's, why he's killing these specific teenagers or how he is able to possess people's bodies. virgil is just 'there' & we have to accept it. the character's are all stupid, the situations do not panic depicts are all stupid & as a whole the film lacks any sort of fore-thought or intelligence behind what's going on. the ending is awful as well, both how virgil is defeated & that sickening & tacky 'this rose will never wilt as long as there is love between us' scene. despite what you may have read there is actually very little on screen gore, two people are stabbed which do not panic depicts by having blood splash over the floor & on the victims clothes, there is a fairly decent slit throat even if i would not just sit impassively in a car as someone stuck their hand in through the window & sliced my throat open with a knife & a scene in which a knife (it's the same knife in all the murder's actually) is stuck into someones chin & it protrudes from their mouth. all the kill scenes are dull with virtually no build up & director galindo fails to inject any tension, scares or atmosphere into them just like the rest of the film in fact. there is not even any nudity either, in fact when micheal & alexandra have sex it is squeaky clean stuff, galindo merely shows them kissing each other on the lips while in bed. as mentioned already in other comments the sight of micheal running around in his babyish pyjama's is both bizarre & very silly looking. do not panic is technically average, the cinematography is static & flat as are the production values in general & the horrible music seems very out of place. there are a couple of scenes where a face pokes out of the tv which is quite an impressive effect. overall there is very little i can recommend do not panic by as it's a pretty terrible film all round

tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to rule the world. as the main demon, classy actor charles dance looks terribly embarrassed to be in the film, but hey, i am sure he was well paid for sacrificing his talents. of all murphy\\'s films, this is easily the worst. i have read some reviews which suggest that it is nice to see murphy in an atypical role, in a non formulaic

there is no chemistry between either of the couples, whatever exists between mei and her men seems to be more lust than love, and for the most part the dialogue is just silly. this may be just a problem with translation, but the frequent usage of the word \"flirt\" in particular reminded me of 8th grade, not head-over-heels, together forever, worth-dying-for love; i also felt we were beat over the head with the wind metaphor. the audience is given very little about the characters to really care about, and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole. i was wishing for a remote control to fast forward, i was slumped in my seat ready to snore, but mostly i just cringed a lot. **spoiler** now, the icing on the cake. or rather, adding insult to injury. the ending

oh, and then mei (dagger embedded in heart) suddenly pops up out of the weeds. then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach it\\'s destination, even slowing conveniently midscreen to hit a tiny blood droplet. wow, cool. well, then mei dies finally i guess because she threw the dagger that was lodged in her chest and bled to death. jin sings, sobs, holds her body

available. it uses a lightweight \"honeycomb\" of aluminum and stainless steel. the entire outer surface (except the windows of course) is covered with a heat shield made of a phenolic resin, thicker on the bottom that faces forward during re-entry. these materials are actually *better* at stopping the kind of radiation we have in space (charged particles) than lead, which is better suited to stopping ionizing photons like x-rays and gamma rays. space radiation is a definite problem for *long term* space flight because of the risk of big solar flares. but it simply was not a serious threat to the apollo astronauts. the command module gave them pretty good protection during their brief (1/2 hour or so) passage through the van allen belts. they all carried dosimeters so we know exactly

smash hit chow made back into two thousand. you never doubt the abilities of any random person to be a master of kungfu or, completely not a master of kung fu. also, the cartoonish beating and contortions that every character seem to be able to endure are so brilliantly installed in the film that despite their utter impossibility, no one ever questions their validity. characters and fly

shots moving through crowds with hand-held camera, quick-paced editing and extreme close-ups here and there, the photography is the thing in this interesting, artistically done film. the plot of this film starts out as a bit of fluff about a beauty contest. the film begins on a warm sunday at the local swimming pool, where we meet the lovely lucienne aka lulu (played by louise brooks) - a bit of a show-off in front of the gawking men by poolside, she soon decides to enter herself to represent france in the miss europe beauty contest, much to the chagrin of her very jealous, stick-in-the-mud fiancé (a pretty annoying fellow, really). strutting down the runway the ten contestants display themselves in swimsuits, while the winner is chosen as the contestant who receives the longest applause (i was wondering, could not the girls just walk slower to prolong their length of time - and thus applause - on the catwalk?!). lulu is soon being chased by a prince and a maharaja, but her hot-headed beau does not like the attentions paid to her by other men or her adoring public, for that matter (i guess he just wants her in his house, cooking his meals, and staying out of sight, eh?!). louise brooks is beautiful and charming, her presence helps enhance this film, but it's really the way it is photographed that held my interest the most. a bit distracting is the odd dubbed sound, which is a bit off. the print on this version looked very clear and full of nice contrast though. watching this i just tried to overlook the sound problems and watch the film visually, and i found the movie to

psycho beach party (provolonie) your basic friendly but whorishly natured player. and finally last but not least there's the model tobey whose dressed up as a drag queen for halloween hoping someone will notice something about him besides his looks played by heartthrob matt phillips. but wait there's the villain shirtless, mostly in the dark with ripped six pack abs, a devils mask and love for decapitations and eye gouging played by the brutally handsome john p. petrelli. along they go on their escapade to the halloween carnivale in west hollywood. hoping for fun and hot guys they end up being stalked and systematically slaughtered one by one by a pointless but amusing killer. and this film is just entertainment, it's fun. there's lots of eye candy, creatively brutal and gory death sequences and manages to generate a good amount of old fashioned suspense and laughs. it plays a lot like a friday the 13th sequel with an all male cast. and all though this is a film about gay men it's not a gay film. this is a horror film cut and dry and any real horror fan will not have a problem admitting to it. it's obvious that it was done on a low budget, but despite the poor film quality the film is smart and energetic fully delivering on it's promises as a brutal horror film that features gay characters. hopefully the film will make some sort of impact, from the audience reaction i

\"condolences\" to parents who drag concession-hungry children to see their movies by using two-tiered, age-discriminating humor (i guess so parents can nod knowingly to each other over the heads of their kids, while receiving these studio \"winks\", as if to say \" they did not get that one, but we sure did -it\\'s because we are older.\")- i do feel the need to point out that nemo is not the

environments, creator gary baseman offers us a visually stimulating experience one that provides a refreshing (if not nostalgic) breather to a genre on the verge of becoming sterilized by computers.

besides that, i think that the pixar crew made this for themselves, even before their kids... and it shows, in the amount of heart in has. this movie is moving, touching, funny, intriguing, and generally engrossing. the character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing, there\\'s a major amount of character growth, and not just of the main character--so rare in animation and often in movies in general. it does not hit you over the head with its points once it\\'s made them--every scene, every frame has a reason in the storyline for being there, and there are no gratuitous shots. not always stating explicitly in words exactly what is going on means subtlety, to me, folks; it means not \"dumbing down\" your movie and assuming the audience is stupid, which it mostly is not. all i can think is, if you can see a bug\\'s life and not feel anything at all, then you must have never made a big mistake, hurt your friends, had a crush, fallen in love, been frustrated that no one would listen to you, lied to someone you care about, felt like a social misfit, gotten excited over a new idea, come up with a great idea, had what you thought was a great idea backfire, been awkward one moment and confident the next, felt the pressure of responsibility, stood up for yourself and your loved ones, stood alone against the crowd, felt like a failure, felt like a big success, felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others... well, you get the point. final words: a+ rating from me; please, if you are going to see it try to see it in the theatre (pan and scan video is not going to work for this movie); if you loved toy story you\\'ll most likely love this (pixar knows how to make movies with heart); if you do love it see it multiple times or you still will not know what you are missing (the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable); and whenever you are feeling really low, just pretend it\\'s a seed, okay?',\n"," 'in a mysterious forest in thailand, many suicidal youths disappear and rescue teams can not find the way out even with compass. the ambitious reporter may (rain li) is making sensationalist journalism exploring the deaths in the forest. her boyfriend and botanist shun shu-hoi (ekin cheng) is developing a means of communication with plants. meanwhile, detective c. c. ha (qi shu) is investigating the rape and death of a woman and the main suspect is patrick wong (tsun-wai chou). detective ha contacts shu- hoi requesting his support trying to communicate with the trees around the area where the woman was murdered. they resolve the case and shu-hoi becomes famous; when may vanishes in the forest, shu-hoi and detective ha seek her out. \"sum yuen\" is a deceptive and boring movie of danny pang. the terrible and laughable story is so ridiculous and absurd that does not deserve any comment. my advice: do not spend your time and money watching this awful flick. my vote is two. title (brazil): \"natureza do mal\" (\"nature of the evil\")',\n"," \"this is lemmon and dennis at their paul simon best. the roles they both deserve oscars for. lemmon's character's pathos arising out of naive optimism is chaplinesque, at times. and dennis is at her best as his edith bunker type wife.\",\n"," 'if busby berkley and orson wells had made a movie together, this mighta been it. coppola has tried so hard throughout his career to \"reject hollywood\" - and hollywood has, in turn, often rejected him - yet he makes a truly gorgeous paean to hollywood production values here. though it gets so over the top at times (can you say \"rosebud\"...?), frederick forrest and teri garr keep it pretty real. and the soundtrack is my all-time favorite. tom waits and crystal gayle - it\\'s a pure gem. \"one from the heart\" makes one wonder what kind of musical orson welles might have come up with - to be fair, coppola\\'s talent has not soured over the decades as he\\'s had either critical or box office failures. the same can not be said of ol\\' orson, who became a caricature of himself in the 60s and never recovered even a whiff of his genius. definitely give this a viewing if you have enjoyed any other coppola film. this gives real texture to his body of work.',\n"," \"this movie is once again, one of those movies that someone thinks or tries to make others think that they understood it. anyone who tries to make any sense of this is a moron!

(it should not be, with william goldman doing the adaptation.) it\\'s gresham\\'s most pedantic. condemned are both racist violence and the death penalty, the former more so than the latter. that\\'s the bothersome part of the plot. okay, gene hackman does his best with the role of the lifetime kk bomber who takes the rap for the real killer of the two jewish children. but he\\'s miscast. hackman is not an unreflective, defiant, redneck racist and murderer. james woods is that character. hackman is absolutely first-rate (without being a bravura actor) when he gets the right role, whether it\\'s villainous or heroic, but he\\'s never been good with accents and, man, does this role call for one. at that, he gives the strongest performance in the film, with support from a couple of seasoned players like harve presnell. gresham\\'s relatively innocent young idealist, chris o\\'donnell, does not convince. he looks the part alright but his voice and gestures suggest a weakness that the character should not have. and he\\'s the main man. some of the supporting players, like bo jackson as sergeant packer, can not seem to act at all. the climax involves one of those detailed execution scenes i have come to loathe. i do not understand why they are there. in a short cinematic exercise in the early 1940s, orson welles used the first-person camera to guide the viewer into a gas chamber. then, in the mid-50s, there was a detailed execution of susan hayward in \"i want to live.\" then there was a hiatus for another twenty years or so before these tasteless scenes came back with a vengeance. here we get to see gene hackman gassed to death, the foamy spittle dripping from his mouth as he expires. but what does this tell us? that execution is horrifying and painful? what else is new? so what do these scenes tell us that we do not already know? i understand some tv channels are negotiating with texas to film executions for broadcast. (how long before the opportunity to pull the switch is auctioned on ebay?) what kind of audience do the writers and directors think they are addressing? the musical score is by carter burwell and it\\'s fairly conventional, full of deep and ominous chords. he\\'s a talented composer who has done quirkier work in better films like \"fargo\" and \"the spanish prisoner.\" judging from the movies that are based on his novels, john gresham is in the not-uncommon position of being at odds with the values of the society he grew up in. a lot of other marginalized writers have also been prompted to explain the sins of their culture\\'s past to the rest of us, beginning maybe with nathaniel hawthorne and running through the southern giants of american literature and playwriting -- tennessee williams, faulkner, and the rest. gresham fits the mold and his work is interesting, but this is a failed effort. the legal aspects are confusing, the characters a bit muddled, and the story itself either too simple or too complex, depending on how you look at it.',\n"," 'the writers get no points for creating a cohesive or logical plot. it\\'s all over the place. a guy creates a worldwide

is a horror anthology film and it was a lot of fun! that\\'s because although the film clearly was horror, some of the stories had a light spirit--and there were even occasionally a few laughs. this is not at all a bad thing as sometimes horror films are a bit stuffy and overly serious. because of this and because all four of the stories were pretty good, it\\'s one of the better movies of this style i have seen. the unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself. four different stories involve people who either rent the home or investigate what happened to the tenants. the first segment starred denholm elliott as a horror writer who has writer\\'s block. so, for a change of scenery, they rent this house. almost immediately elliott\\'s block vanishes and he works steadily on a tale about a serial killer. amazingly, soon after his block vanishes he begins to actually see his fictional character! again and again, the psychotic killer appears and then disappears--making it seem as if he is losing his mind. this might just be the best of the stories, as the nice twist ending makes the story come alive. the second, while not bad at all, is probably the weakest. peter cushing plays a bachelor who is pining for a girl friend who died some time ago (though the picture of her looked amazingly contemporary). when he enters a chamber of horrors wax museum in town, he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost lady and he is both fascinated and scared by this. later, a friend (joss ackland) visits and he, too, sees the figure and is entranced by it. this all leads to an ending that, frankly, was a bit of a letdown. christopher lee then stars as an incredibly harsh and stern father to a pathetic little girl. during most of this segment, lee seemed like an idiot, but in the end you can understand his demeanor. though slow, this one ended very well. the fourth segment was the silliest and was meant to parody the genre. jon pertwee (the third \"doctor\" from the dr. who television series) is a very temperamental actor known for his portrayals of dracula. however, nothing is right about the film according to him and in a fit of pique, he stomps off the set to find better props for this vampire film. it\\'s actually pretty interesting that he played this role, as it seemed like a natural for christopher lee who played dracula or other vampires a bazillion times (give or take a few). i enjoyed pertwee\\'s line when he basically said that lee\\'s and other recent incarnations of dracula were all crap compared to bela lugosi\\'s! perhaps this is why lee did not take this part! despite some very silly moments, it was very entertaining and fun--possibly as good or better than the first segment. considering that the film started and ended so well, had excellent acting and writing, it\\'s hard not to like this film.',\n"," 'art school confidential is a simply terrible movie built from a script that needed dozens

rude towards his callers, often putting them in their place before they realise what's going on. though this is what has made him a popular radio show host, it has also earned him numerous enemies. the acting in this film was hugely impressive with not one dud actor in it. eric bogosian is brilliant as barry champlain, the troubled talk radio host with alec baldwin turning in a strong performance as barry's boss, dan. it also features the voice of, and cameo appearance by, michael wincott (my reason for wanting to see this). the story was really well written as, despite his arrogance, you feel for barry as more about his troubled life is revealed and you see how vulnerable he really is. i'd recommend this film to anyone as it is captivating and, more importantly real on

complimented by similarly weak script, which often consists of nonsensical jabbering, and is really of little consequence for the most part. acting can only be described as sub-par, which is par for the course in this instance. truly lax direction does not help things either. special effect mainly is for numerous close-ups of various gory bodies missing limbs, and so forth. of course, there is the obligatory creature which periodically emerges at feeding time, which looks something like a big monster octopus thing, where its animation only consists of its pointed teeth ascending and descending in rhythmic articulation. overall, the end result is none too convincing, sure, but admittedly is almost entertaining in a cheesy kind of fashion. it seems what the film makers were going for was a sort of low-rent hybrid of jaws and piranha, but the final product is just a bloody shambles, much like the corpses incessantly shown throughout this picture. i find it difficult to think of

with downright impossibly ridiculous situations and an extremely unlikely cast of characters - including \"bitch,\" the main character\\'s abusive ex-girlfriend - that had me laughing out loud more than a few times. there were a lot of things outside of the main storyline that stood out as downright hilarious concepts, such as the fake john travolta film, \"oh shenannigans!\" from which they show clips. though these elements made me chuckle, they really do not stand out from the entire genre of late-teen-college-age movie as something original. what really stands out from the film is the high amount of action that happens within the scenes, but having no real interaction with the plot. for example two movie theater clerks poke holes into paper cups and get kinky with the popcorn tubs while two main characters talk about going out to the improv later that night. this is the kind of movie that is best watched with a couple of drinks and some good friends that you have gotten up to

to shoot the bad guys in the street with a perfect shot from the bridal suite? how did peter fonda recover completely in a 24 hour period after being gut shot? how did russell crow's mouth heal completely after being beaten unmercifully by peter fonda? why was russell crow's hands handcuffed in front and not in the back? i could go on and on, but i have already wasted enough time and money on this complete mess of a movie.\",\n"," \"this film, which is based on a true story, comes from first time director and long time actor, denzel washington. denzel washington has given us some of the best performances of the last decade, as a black soldier in the civil war in glory, and a lawyer in the acclaimed philadelphia. and of course, he made special notoriety last year when he won the academy award for best actor in training day, in which denzel washington became the first african american to receive the award for best actor. i guess denzel wanted a change of pace, so he chose to direct antwone fisher, in which he also stars. fisher is played by derek luke, who is new to the silver screen, but has made some guest appearances on such television shows as king of queens, and he will be appearing in the upcoming film release of biker boyz. this is a truly well done film from denzel washington, considering it was his first time directing. undoubtedly, denzel felt some kind of commitment and believed in the real life story of antwone fisher. antwone fisher is about a young african american man in the navy who constantly gets into fights, and after one particular brawl he is sent to see a navy psychiatrist named jerome davenport, played by denzel washington. davenport helps antwone to deal with his troubled past and learn to move on with his life, by finding his birth mother who had to give him up at birth because she was in prison. what makes this film good is the fact that it's not overly melodramatic. i was expecting something a little more like good will hunting, with a lot of swearing, fighting and vulgarity. not that i did not like good will hunting, or the swearing, fighting and vulgarity of the film were out of place. quite the contrary! however, antwone fisher is a true story, and i do not think that washington wanted to sensationalize the story for dramatic affect in the film. do not get me wrong, there are moments when we see antwone fighting, carrying on and having moments when it seems like the world is closing in on him. after all, in his first session with his psychiatrist, the character played by washington, devenport asks fisher where he was born, and fisher's response is, `from under a rock,' an obvious jab at the pressures waning on antwone fisher's soul. but i had to appreciate the fact that this film was not sensationalized for dramatic affect. i think it shows real character on the part of denzel washington to deliver a more realistic story and to avoid the typical clichés that are common in hollywood films, even those based on true stories. one other point that i would like to bring up about antwone fisher is the acting. over all, performances were good in the film, but not great. at times, i think it was a bit obvious that the main characters were actors, but overall, to complain about performances in this film would be ludicrous. one actress that i would like to point out in this film is viola davis. she plays antwone's mother, but she says barely two sentences in the movie at all, but not so much because she appears at the end of the film, but more because she in shock that her long lost son, antwone has found her. what i would like to point out about her as an actress in the lack of use of her. she in basically a character actress, and i have not seen her play any really elaborate roles. she made appearances in traffic, out of sight, kate & leopold, and two recent films: far from heaven and solaris. in steven soderberg's remake of solaris, she played a scientist on a doomed space craft orbiting a planet. in that film, she is confronted by george clooney's character and she drawn to tears by what clooney tells her in a particular scene. when i first saw solaris, i remember seeing her tear up in the scene and thinking, wow, this woman can act. it was as if you could feel the character's grief. in that brief shot of her face, she gave so much expression and i honestly felt very sorry for her character's sadness and trouble in the film. i think she has definite potential as an actress and should be used more often perhaps in leading roles, rather than just as a character driven actress. nonetheless, antwone fisher is a very good movie. denzel washington, as always, pulls off a great performance and he gives us a great directorial debut. also, derek luke is a very talented actor. i think that antwone fisher will bring his immense critical fame for his portrayal of the troubled man, but i think that his public popularity will increase with the release of biker boyz, which also stars lawrence fishburn. antwone fisher is based on the book `finding fish: a memoir,' by antwone quenton fisher. **\",\n"," 'addams family reunion is the weakest entry of the three films, but it is better than the awful tv series(new addams family). the other two films were truly excellent, and seeing that most of the crew were replaced, it was obvious it was going to be a failure. the worst scene was the scene with the postman, that was just cringeworthy beyond belief. tim curry is a brilliant actor, and he is the only actor i can forgive for being here. raul julia had died, so it was perfectly natural for him to be replaced. tim curry did quite well as gomez, but raul julia was easily the better gomez in terms of spirit and charisma. curry looked a bit uncomfortable at times especially in that awful purple pinstriped suit they made him wear, but he had the best lines that at least he made some effort with. daryl hannah tried hard,giving an equally spirited performance, but she is too beautiful for the character. i also thought she was too young for morticia. these two are really talented actors(i have genuine respect for them) and sometimes you find an actor that has a role that does not suit them , evident here. patrick thomas was just embarrassing. christopher lloyd was born to play fester and thomas badly overacted. none of his actions were reminiscent of the original fester. the children were not very good either. nicole fugere was bearable, but she rarely uttered a word, and her stare felt rather unpleasant. jerry messing was awful, so annoying. he was too big and too loud. to say the cast were entirely to blame is very unfair, believe me the script was so poor, i am surprised the actors were not shaking with embarrassment. one of the few bright spots was the brief chemistry between tim curry and ed begley jnr, bringing back fond memories of tales of the crypt, when curry played three members of a family, with begley playing a salesman. the most embarrassing moments were the jeffrey and melinda scenes in the mansion, who served no real purpose to the poorly thought-out plot. that said, the director is entirely to blame for the failure of this movie; he had no idea how to direct them. the script was repulsive, really childish, and should have a razzie for worst screenplay. and the special effects were poorly executed. there was good chemistry between curry and hannah, who tried their best, with the poor material. the dance routine was quite interesting, although i have seen tim curry dance better in films like annie and rhps. i would have loved to have heard curry sing, for he has a great singing voice, because raul julia sang a mamooshka in the first movie. in conclusion, an embarrassment, but not the worst movie ever. 4/10 for the efforts of curry, hannah and begley. bethany cox.',\n"," 'i should have listened. i was warned, and still, i paid money for this, after

both have advanced degrees, and we see 50+ independent films a year. so filmic subtlety is not lost on us. we drove for an hour through horrendous traffic to see this highly-rated film, yet this is the only movie in 25 years of adult moviegoing that we have ever walked out of. it reminded me of the worst excesses of 60's french new wave. long stretches of people staring. long stretches of silence and monosyllables. more long stretches of loud noise and incomprehensible voices. short cut-in scenes that advanced the story (what there was of it) and characters not a bit. we get it; we get it--these people are alienated. big deal. can i care about two people who are supposed to be intelligent, yet they can not think of a thing to do to amuse themselves in one of the world's major cities? can i believe in a young woman who's supposed to be a recent philosophy graduate of yale, who can not think of anything to do with her time but stare out the window of her expensive hotel? can i believe this same young woman came to tokyo with her working husband, yet seems totally at a loss when he actually leaves to work? can i believe that someone who is interested in philosophy so much that she majors in it in college can only be happy bar hopping, dancing, smoking weed, and singing karaoke? can i believe that a faded hollywood star who is being paid 2 million dollars for a commercial would come to tokyo absolutely alone, without even an aide of any kind? and most of all, can i call a film that does nothing more than follow these two hapless and uninteresting people around for several days without a trace of drama or art profound? i think not. do not waste your money. this is one of those rare instances when i can only conclude that there is some vast critical conspiracy to hoodwink the american public. surprise! the emperor has no clothes.\",\n"," \"what's most surprising about this film is the date, 1955. it is a nice criminal detective comedy since all ends well that had started very grimly and so bad. if we take this film like all films by hitchcock should be taken, that is to say as a metaphor of real life, of history, of fate, then we might be less surprised by the date. after all the worst is gone, is behind. the war is finished, the second world war and the korean war, and even mccarthy is dead and buried, politically i mean. we can breathe. the future is clear. the complications are all behind. we are finally getting out of this dark hole in which we had been buried for a long time. the famous post war thirty glorious years and its baby boom generation are starting to bring in the fruit of our suffering, sweating and efforts if not travail. what we have produced is being bought by some millionaire. our work is recognized and valorized. we are going to be famous, great, rich, beautiful, who knows what else. so we can bury the past. we can un-bury it, and then bury it again, and eventually un-bury it a second time, but why not re-bury that poor past in order to finally get it out once more and discover it was not so bad and it was nothing but some kind of sad heart disease, a disease of the heart, a weak heart crushed by passions, love passion, dreams that me made into nightmares, and maybe some anger. but the film is surprising because hitchcock manages to have absolutely no staircase, no flights of steps, with or without mezzanines, and yet do not believe me that easy because it is not flat country indeed. and so up they go and down they go, the roads and the tramps, and all the other people in that village, uphill and downhill, upstage and downstage, upriver and downriver, up the strokes and down the strokes to paint and paint and paint reality till no one recognizes it or sees it. and if it were not enough to constantly go up and down lanes and paths and trails and tracks, you go up and down into and out of the ground, you dig out and fill up and dig in and refill up and dig out again and fill up a third time and dig up this time and fill down for the last time. all that vertical movement around a man who is dead and lying horizontal in the middle of the auburn and russet leaves of the fall. hitchcock is still with us. and he is all the more with us because he explores the psyche of the human species. when they meet with death, their first reaction is to feel guilty for a crime they assume at once they have committed. paranoid species. then they feel relieved because someone else assumes the crime they have committed till they feel guilty again and reveal their own doing in the crime. neurotic, psychotic and schizophrenic, all in one same species. but then they try to forget and wipe it out to go on with the present and their lives. but that is to no avail because life is stronger than illusions and death is even stronger than life. so the crime comes back because it has to be brought out and registered for the life of the living to be able to go on. and it is then that it is all revealed that human beings are as dumb as my thumb and instead of having thought and thought again and pondered, they jumped to conclusions without even thinking one second. and it is the crazy doctor who trips on cadavers all the time and beg their pardons for having disturbed them who finds out all that death was natural and the hullabaloo was nothing but a mid summer night's dream in the middle of the fall. in other words hitchcock is questioning us on the real value of life when death is no longer a crime. there seems to be little left in life if that is the case. crime and murder are the real spices of life which is so banal and tasteless otherwise. dr jacques coulardeau, university paris dauphine, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint

gleeful \"i wish i could have seen the look on his face\" when she tricked the pursuing detective into thinking he had run over a woman. finally, the transformation of brian dennehy\\'s character into just another corrupt cop left me with a distinct sour taste at the end of the movie. after everything is said and done, for brown and dennehy it\\'s all about the money. even schwarzenegger was never this cynical in his movies. the last thing that bothered me is that i always presumed movie special effects were to keep the actors safe. since here they are used to kill, it seems like a betrayal of

the greatest opera singers of all time, it fails badly. all that is desirable in this movie is the opera, and one can best find a recording of pavarotti doing what he does best. the plot revolves around a romance with a doctor who heals his throat which has suddenly become troublesome. only because it came out so long ago is it largely forgotten. like most opera stars, pavarotti is a decent actor and has stage presence aside from his singing talent, and nothing that he does in this movie negates that opinion. his culpability lies in not rejecting the horrid script. perhaps because great operas can have silly stories he tolerated this one. who knows, except those involved? do we need to know? the plot is weak and trite. this movie is like trudging through cold mud to pick off a few juicy tidbits (the opera music) hanging above the mud. we have other ways in which to appreciate the great pavarotti, and this one is not one of them. just get one of his many superb opera or vocal-concert recordings and recognize the master tenor where he is most suited. it would be one of imdb's 100 worst films if more people remembered it and gave it some votes; it would fit neatly in a list including several efforts of singers, actors, models, and athletes to exploit their popularity through film. very often it all goes badly wrong due to incompetent acting or a horrible script.

telekinetic car to the point of alienating his fiancee. 2. a man who lives in a filthy apartment is understandably freaked out when a living organism evolved from his six-month old tuna casserole. 3. a woman thinks she has found the perfect man through a computer dating service.. that is until he starts to act weird.. and there you have it. some of them are pretty amusing due to their outlandish premises (my favourite being number 2) but you get the feeling they were meant to be a) frightening and b) morality plays, unfortunately they fail miserably on both counts. to sum up then, this flick is an obscure curiosity.. for very good reasons.',\n"," '... this film noire set piece suffers from murky sound (at least, as shown on the inadequate equipment of both the seattle and maine film

all have the right to your opinion about my opinion, but hey, i am entitled to my opinion too. avatar is grade a crap. that's right, it's crap. i say this for one simple reason: without the special effects this movie would never, ever captivate and take a hold of audiences like it has in the past week. ask yourself this one question: if it did not have the effects, the navi plugging their hair into the trees like it's a damn broadband jack, mech suits(just like the ones in matrix revolutions) and barely futuristic ospreys, would you care about this movie at all? it's a truism when they say this movie is nothing more than dances with wolves in space. some people may argue back that star wars borrowed from hidden fortress, but at least it had enough compelling plot points to make it look different, such as i do not know... the force? the death star? outer space? a location that has nothing at all to do with earth? this important set of points clearly differentiates star wars and hidden fortress. but the difference between avatar and dances with wolves is... cgi. this cgi may be pretty but it cannot ever substitute for story and plot development. speaking of, the characters save but a few are either very bland or stereotypes. the worst part is the story and the movie gives us no reason to care about the characters. you know what? i'll go one step further and say that the only difference between avatar and a star wars prequel is this: avatar has an environmental story that we can relate to. that's it. true, the action scenes in avatar are well done, but hell, the action scenes in the star wars prequels were also arguably well-done. still, there's that nagging lack of story development. avatar is a huge let-down and does not belong on the best-of list of anybody with common sense.\",\n"," \"okay, like many other such films, spawned out of a snl skit. but tim meadows does a fairly fantastic job of making a 3 minute one-dimensional character into a

distinction goes to \"the zodiac\". for sure, the worst movie ever created!',\n"," 'i cannot get past the message of this movie. it\\'s laid out much too clearly to ignore, and it is obscene because it has lost its sense of what it\\'s about. i have not read the novel, but pollack\\'s film opens with a scene at a cia-front organization in new york, which is broken into by two professional assassins, headed by max von sydow, who proceed to brutally slaughter the half dozen quirky staff members we have come to know and understand. the staff include an elderly female receptionist, a fussy elderly professorial guy who\\'s toupee falls off when he is machine-gunned (is that a joke?), and, last, the beautiful tina chen who looks up from the copier, realizes she is about to be murdered, and says, pitifully brave, \"i will not scream.\" von sydow replies sympathetically, \"i know.\" these murders are completely unexpected, savage, unmotivated by anything that we are aware of, and graphic. it is a brutal scene. there is absolutely no way in which von sydow and his henchman can be redeemed. and yet that is exactly what pollack tries to do towards the end. after having killed these innocent good guys, von sydow switches sides (because the other side is willing to pay him) and assassinates the evil mastermind behind a complicated intramural cia plot. the script then turns him into a perfectly reasonable, sensitive human being. \"it is better to live in europe. things are not so rushed.\" or whatever. i swear i am not making this up. pollack wants us to believe that it is better to be an honest mass murderer than a crooked bureaucrat. that\\'s the message. you should write it down in case you forget. just exactly what kind of psychiatric shambles do you have to be in order to turn ordinary values, not to mention common sense, upside-down like that? i understand that there are thoughtful adults who dislike the government of the united states, even hate it, and who see conspiracies just about everywhere, providing a knee-jerk explanation for otherwise unexplainable events. i know that people who think this way exist because i number some of them among my closer friends. nevertheless, at some point this dislike, this hatred, if it increases in intensity, must pass beyond politics or ethics and into the realm of the psychiatric. i do not for a moment believe that a man who murders people for money is better than a sinister government official. i do not care how suave and cultured the murderer is or whether he knows how to reach the louvre on the metro. whoever is purveying that message needs either medication or meditation. i\\'d like to be able to argue that the production is as thoroughly rotten as its message, but i can not. it\\'s quite well done. (in some ways that\\'s worse, because it makes the film less dismissable.) even new york city looks photogenic on the screen. and it\\'s been a long time since i have thought of new york as photogenic. robert redford does an admirable job of projecting his character\\'s initial shock and confusion, but then turns into a telecommunicational semi-genius. and, man, he looks just fine! his wardrobe is just right. even his rimless glasses are becoming. and his peacoat. it\\'s not everyone who can make a navy pea jacket look glamorous. he seems extremely handsome too, the swine. i want to look like that. i want to wear a denim shirt and a tie with such panache. faye dunaway is alright in her role but it\\'s not too believable a role. would anybody eagerly sleep with a guy who has just kidnapped her and is holding her at gunpoint? even if he did look like redford? would anyone be emotionally wounded if, when this ambivalent relationship is about to end, redford asked her not to tell anybody about what happened? cliff robertson is surprisingly good. he does one or two extremely good double-takes. the mailman is superb. the fight between him and redford in a crowded apartment is exquisitely choreographed and, for once, we really do not know for sure how it will turn out, because redford (a book reader after all) seems mismatched against the brute cunning of this hired assassin. this is one of john housemann\\'s final roles. a shame. he\\'s a magnet on screen. and what an end to his life: a friend finds him lost, wandering the streets of new york, in a neighborhood he\\'d been familiar with for most of his life. yes, the movie is very well executed, but i can not ignore that vicious, paranoid message. i have the same problem with leni riefenstahl\\'s \"triumph of the will.\" or her olympic documentary in which the announcer is watching a foot race in which jesse owens is pulling into the lead and says ominously, \"this negro is dangerous.\"',\n"," \"it is one of the best of stephen chow. i give it a nine out of ten. i was surprised to see that shaolin soccer was rated on top of all singsing's movies. unbelievable.\",\n"," 'yesterday, i went to the monthly antique flea market that comes to town. i really have no interest in such things, but i went for the fellowship of friends who do have such an interest. looking over the hundreds of vendor, passing many of them quickly, i spotted someone selling vhs tapes and dvds. most of the films he had on dvd were rather recent; the oldest one i noticed was the 1940 cary grant-irene dunne co-starrer my favorite wife. but the vhs tapes, by their nature, were mostly older films. i could not resist buying something since they were being sold at 3 tapes for $10.00. what a bargain, as eddie murphy used to say. i came across one film that i had heard about for years but had never seen: john cassavettes\\'s opening night (1977). well, i certainly wanted that being a fan of gena rowlands, and i had heard that this film contained one of her finest performances. he also had faces (1968). i had seen this about 20 years ago, a time when i probably had not had enough life experience to appreciate it thoroughly. and i wanted to take advantage of the bargain, so i grabbed that one too. my other choice was claire\\'s knee (1970). when i got home, i decided to put aside the work i had planned to do so that i could watch opening night. i was totally enthralled by this film. it focuses on myrtle gordon (gena rowlands), a famous actress of stage and screen, who, during out-of-town previews, is having personal and professional problems coming to terms with both her character and the play\\'s theme of facing aging. after one rehearsal, an avid fan and autograph hound accosts her with cries (and tears) of \"i love you! i love you!\" a few minutes later, this fan is hit by a car and killed. this begins myrtle\\'s descent into herself where she must face her own fears of aging, the future of her career as a mature actress, and the inadequacies she finds in the play itself (written by a much older female dramatist, played by joan blondell). throughout the film, she sees the dead girl, an obvious symbol of her past; drinks almost constantly; and receives insincere support from her director (ben gazzara), the producer (paul stewart), her costar (john cassavettes himself), and the dramatist. actually, they are more concerned about how her behavior will affect them and their careers: flubbing lines on stage, improvising new lines, generally cracking up on stage, and arriving for the broadway opening totally drunk. this story functions not only to address the issues of aging but also to promote cassavettes\\'s displeasure with mainstream movie-making. as i watched the film, i was at times surprised, confused, amused, disparaging, but ultimately involved, entertained, and satisfied. cassavettes really had a great sense of humor, cared very much that his audience understood what he was implying, and wanted them to be emotionally involved in the story. he makes allusions to all about eve with the use of the avid theater fan, even dressing the young girl in a slicker and hat similar to the one worn by anne baxter at the beginning of that film. this allusion functions most obviously to support his aging theme, the contrast of the older and younger woman. he also obviously uses the contrast as a symbol for myrtle\\'s confronting her own lost youth. at first, i felt the symbolism was too obvious, but then i realized that that was cassavettes\\'s intention. he does not want his audience misunderstanding what he\\'s getting at; if they did, it would interfere with their emotional involvement. this spectre of youth haunts myrtle, attacks her, and wants to destroy her. myrtle eventually \"kills\" her, but before she can really come to terms with herself and the play, she must reach bottom (another figurative death?). so cassavettes has her get so drunk that she can not walk and must crawl to her dressing room the night the play opens on broadway. she resurrects herself (helping yourself out of such situations is also important to the film\\'s theme) and makes the play a success by giving a great performance and changing the direction of play for the better by improvising so that it contains some ray of hope for the aging character she\\'s playing. these scenes are funny and interesting. cassavettes and rowlands actually did the play in front of live audiences, who did and did not know they were going to be part of a movie. the play they are doing also acts as contrast: it\\'s mainstream and self-serious about the issues it addresses, that is, until myrtle changes its denouement. in doing so, she also improves the work of her co-stars. the natural evolution of interaction (achieved through improvisation)between and among human beings, subjective realism, and universal truth - these were cassavettes\\'s concerns in making films. gena rowlands is amazing throughout. of course, she has that great face, and cassavettes (notoriously in love with her throughout their marriage) treats us to numerous closeups of it so that we too can feel her emotions and that we know what\\'s going on inside of her. she makes you care so much about this character that you want to see her work her way out of this crisis of the soul. and this is what holds your attention for the 2 hours and 30 minutes running time. the film is deliberately paced at times and requires constant attention, but anyone with interest in good film-making and great acting will be rewarded. someone else said that this is a movie for people who love movies. all others be forewarned. seek out opening night if you have never seen it. everyone in it is excellent, and it\\'s one of cassavettes\\'s best films.',\n"," \"as a fan of c.j.'s earlier movie, latter days, i really wanted to like this film. the nicest thing i can say, however, is that it's not an awful film. there are some good performances, and a few funny scenes. in particular, tori spelling has a couple of great scenes where she's talking to her fiancé's ex-boyfriend. overall, though, it's pretty week. the script falls back on weird coincidences and clichéd movie moments way too often. (the main character went to stanford on a golf scholarship, and his high school buddy does not even know that he plays the game?) most of the time, this movie had no idea where it was going or what it was trying to say. there are a lot of scenes that are mildly cute, but ultimately turn out to be a waste of time. and you could easily cut half the characters from the film without losing anything.

imagine nora charles breaking up a young couple and driving a young man to steal. outrageous! however, as many people know, when loy first came to hollywood, she did quite a few of these exotic

embarrassment whenever a new british film is released, because it's almost always bad. but alas, this is not the case with michael winterbottom's fascinating wonderland. here winterbottom has gone back to the roots of the ken loach, mike leigh genre of kitchen-sink drama, crossing it with the narrative feel of robert altman, and the free-from style of lars von trier, creating in the process a new and deeply affecting tale of three south london sister over the course of one weekend (three days). the great thing about this is, briefly, for the course of the film anyway, british cinema has it's own identity. the big brit films of the last few years have all been tired american knock-offs, from guy ritchie's pathetic lock-stock and snatch, to the empty romanticised views depicted in films like four wedding and notting hill. wonderland gives an authentic view of london, without the glamour but with much more pathos, and fully developed characters. the ensemble cast of rising character actors are perfectly put together, they may not be familiar to some audiences even in the uk, but the work of the three female leads, mckee, parker and henderson are given fine support from the men, ian hart, john simm and david fahm. the cinema-verite style gives the film a strong realism, making some the more depressing scenes almost un-watchable, but winterbottom and writer laurence coriat should be commended for trying something different within the confines of the ever-predictable british film industry (). it sadness me that this film is so underrated, whilst average films like billy elliot gather a barrage of oscar and bafta nominations, i do not remember wonderland getting a mention. this is by far the best british film i have seen in a long time, not a perfect film by any

lousy script; there was so much futile effort put into writing a pointlessly convoluted story which is simply too bothersome to follow (considering it\\'s only a comedy) that the writer(s) forgot to make the damn thing funny, which, as far as i can recall, is what the whole point of a comedy is supposed to be. i have never seen this moron before. some people even say \"if you are a moron fan you\\'ll love this\" bla bla bla. a moron fan? does this non-descript person really have fans? a comedy as badly written as this requires a mega-talent to eke out a laugh or two out of it, someone like steve coogan and not your average moron. if you are going to make a comedy about actors then at least make them out to be the utter morons that they usually are. the characters of caine and moron are insufficiently dumb. the single most annoying thing about this unfunny collection of scenes is the little girl. only a truly horrible writer would think that to spice up a lousy script it\\'s wise to include a super-intelligent wise-ass kid. smart-a** kids are not even funny to bill cosby fans any more. in \"little miss sunshine\" we had a totally normal kid and she was very funny. this stupid

darkest hour, but which for me, in my early twenties, was always one fun-filled adventure after another. i truly miss those times. as one reviewer remarked, \"this film very aptly captures the stark,

bill hickman. the look of horror on richard lynch\\'s face, along with the defensive gestures, are so out-of-character for an actor much better known as a source of terror rather than an object of it,

there was one character that i thought was alright, but he/she (not revealing it here) was killed off way before the end. the other characters was poorly executed and even the supposed hero/heroine

beauty of its wilderness photography. the story takes place in the 17th century in what was to be canada; it concerns a jesuit priest (father laforgue) from an upper class family in france who comes to quebec city and is tasked with traveling through the wilderness some 1,500 miles west to work at the huron mission there. laforgue is accompanied on his journey by a party of algonquin indians as well as by daniel, a young french interpreter who is primarily just up for the adventure. as the journey proceeds and the seasons move from fall into a harsh winter the mood of the film becomes ever more bleak. the continuing culture clashes between the algonqins and laforgue are sometimes humorous but are ultimately sad in their revealing insights into how difficult it is for one culture to understand another. one scene has laforgue transcribing a brief story told by the algonquin chief and then having daniel take the transcription some distance and read it back to another tribesman. laforgue is trying to show the indians that he has much to teach them, but their interpretation of the incident is that he must be some sort of demon. when the party meets up with some members of another tribe and they see laforgue dressed in his black robe and ask if he is intelligent, the algonquin chief quickly answers, \"no.\" on the other hand laforgue views the indians in their current unenlightened state as savages. not all is love and harmony between the various indian tribes. when the lafourgue party encounters a band of iroquois there are some scenes of violence and torture where the squeamish may want to avert their eyes. daniel, speaking the algonquin language and having taken up with the chief\\'s daughter, begins to have some understanding of the indians and their ways. one interesting exchange between daniel and lagorgue is: daniel: they believe that in the forest at night the dead can see. laforgue: it\\'s childish daniel. daniel: is it harder to believe than in men of paradise where we all sit on clouds and look at god? laforgue\\'s most singular personal characteristic is his unwavering faith. his reaction to sexual temptation is confession of sin and self flogging. he sincerely believes that christianity can bring salvation to the indians, but the indians have their own gods and view laforgue with incomprehension. the film\\'s success in making us understand both of these positions gives the ultimate conclusion a dimension of tragedy.',\n"," \"from opening to closing midnight run is the definative road movie, and is an absolute must view.

bryan singer, this top-drawer cinematic adaptation of the popular marvel comic series sets a whole new standard for filming superhero sagas. unlike the gratuitously overblown, happily-ever-after, d.c. comics inspired \"superman\" and \"batman\" franchises, \"x-men\" differs because marvel comics forged superheroes with tragic flaws. not only does singer orchestrate an entertaining but intelligent yarn around titans of good and evil battling for supremacy with the fate of mankind at stake, but he also tackles important cultural issues integral to the plot that enhance its subtext about intolerance. ultimately, \"x-men\" qualifies as the best superhero comic book movie ever produced, thanks to a stellar cast led by shakespearean heavyweights patrick \"star trek: the next generation\" stewart and sir ian \"richard ii\" mckellen, \"matrix\" style special effects which compliment rather than eclipse the plot, and a literate script that parries childish pratfalls. obviously, hardcore aficionados of either the animated tv series (1992-98) or the comic book itself may complain about the various liberties that singer and scenarist david hayter take with the subject matter. over the opening credits, patrick stewart narrates that \"in the not too distant future\" genetic mutations will trigger the \"next stage of evolution.\" as the next evolutionary stage of life, mutantsa.k.a. homo superiorwill suffer persecution because they are not only different but also potentially dangerous. the prejudice that mankind manifests toward these mutants serves as an allegory for our current climate of political, racial, and sexual bigotry as well as the uncertainty that older teenagers and younger twentysomethings encounter as they search for their niche in society. some critics have compared the showdown between professor x (stewart) and magneto (mckellen) with the rivalry between martin luther king and malcolm x during the turbulent 1960s, while others have recognized mutants as symbols of any oppressed group forced to identify themselves, whether they be classified as homosexuals, communists, jewish, or firearms owners. like the famous \"star wars\" prologue, stewart\\'s voice-over neatly encapsulates the origins of the \"x-men\" and the inherent conflicts confronting them. while \"superman\" and \"batman\" unfolded in linear fashion, starting from the beginning, singer picks up \"x-men\" somewhere in the middle. the setting is poland in 1944, and the nazis are parading helpless jews into the gas chambers for extermination. when young erik lensherr (brett morris, bearing an uncanny resemblance to the older ian mckellen) finds himself separated from his parents as the nazis are about to gas them, he experiences such heretofore unknown terror that he emanates an invisible force field with his fingertips. he destroys the high, iron, barb-wired gates while several soldiers struggle to restrain him. finally, smashing lensherr in the face with his rifle butt, one nazi sentry knocks him unconscious. nevertheless, his supernatural powers stun the guards. this grim scene in auschwitz hearkens back to \"schindler\\'s list (1193), while the show of paranormal power recalls brian de palma\\'s \"carrie.\" as introductions go, the concentration camp scene grips with its poignancy. clearly, this horrific, downbeat scene is not the usual way to kick off a superficial movie about a comic book franchise. flash-forwarding through time, singer brings us to contemporary washington, d.c. dr. jean gray (\"goldeneye\\'s statuesque famke janssen), a telepathic mutant with telekinetic powers, address congress on the controversial subject of mutant registration. senator robert kelly (bruce davidson of \"willard\") believes mutants with their extraordinary physical and mental prowess endanger humanity. the fanatical kelly demands all mutants be required to identify themselves. moreover, he campaigns for registering them since they cannot be trusted to supervise their powers responsibly. some mutants, he argues, can eavesdrop on your mind and read your thoughts. while kelly drums up support for his proposed legislation, dr. charles xavier (patrick stewart) watches quietly from the balcony. although confined to a wheelchair, xavier is a super-telepath that can do what kelly fears the most. not only can xavier read your innermost thoughts, but he also can exert control of another person\\'s body and speak through them with the ease of a ventriloquist. unlike the cynical erik lensherr, a.k.a. magneto, who insists war between humans and mutants is inevitable, xavier contends that mutants and humans can co-exist in harmony. as far as xavier is concerned, people like kelly are well-meaning but misinformed. xavier has established a school for gifted youth in westchester, new york, where he teaches young mutants to curb their potentially destructive urges. some of his long-time students, cyclops (james marsden of \"27 dresses\") who sports special sunglasses to shield his lethal laser beam eyes; storm (halle berry of \"die another day\") who controls weather and deploys lightning bots; and dr. jean grey serve as instructors when they are not running errands for xavier. concisely, in a model of economy, singer establishes the characters and creates the overall conflict between them while broaching questions about the enormity of segregation! moreover, he inserts several amusing tidbits of humor that flesh out the characters without detracting from the storyline. the conflict in david hayter\\'s screenplay that prompts magneto and xavier to clash again concerns tow mutants thrown together by fate. a teenage girl in meridian, mississippi, marie (anna paquin of \"the piano\") discovers her touch can kill. also known as \\'rogue,\\' she can drain the life out of people. horrified by her inexplicable power, she hits the road and eventually meets logan (hugh jackman), a rough-hewn cage fighter nicknamed \\'wolverine,\\' an anti-social amnesia-stricken loner searching for his past. director bryan singer toils throughout \"x-men\" to dispel any notions that it is just another disposable comic book epic. he triumphs in every department from superb casting to thoughtful plotting. stewart and mckellen embellish \"x-men\" and provide it with the kind of dignity that alec guinness brought to \"star wars.\" when magneto and xavier speak, their conversations sound like the oral equivalent of a chess match. \"x-men\" hits the mark because singer and hayter fuse superior dramatic elements in the best aristotelian fashion; its heroes experience a tough time winning.',\n"," 'if you like edge of your seat action and non stop fright, then you have to see the 1990 remake

silly stuff. but then, the idea is silly. it is almost unbelievable that a human baby could be sired to adulthood by chimpanzees. i am tempted to say completely unbelievable, but that the concept has never been tried. and there is certainly a bit too much anthropomorphism for comfort. though under the circumstances i can see how that would be very difficult to avoid. we also now have a much greater insight into the issues of acculturation, and know that a human raised from infancy without human behavioural prompts would ultimately never learn them in adulthood. still, if you can get your head around that lot, there's a great deal to admire that is both imaginative and daring. lambert does the beast thing with tremendous aplomb. i am tempted to say that it is the most convincing and sympathetic role i have seen him play. there are plenty of other excellent performances too. not least of which are sir ralph richardson and ian holm. what is particularly disturbing - and rightly so - is the simian perception of humans. we get to see ourselves almost from the point of view of the poor, dumb, helpless brutes over whom we so routinely lord it. and it demonstrates well how the phony 'civilisation' and 'morality' with which we cloak and justify our conduct, is no more than an expression of own selfishness and arrogance. it may seem a little overstated at times, especially in the hideous museum dissection rooms, but what we see is not just a truth about the victorians; its a truth about the way we are today. it's one that needs to be stated, and cannot be stated often enough. holm's character's obsession with the 'ray-zor' as a symptom of civilisation - as if to possess facial hair were a primitive condition to be scorned - is an excellent case in point. primitive bearded readers take note. the story is depressing. ultimately it's a tragedy. because even though he returns to the jungle and the freedom from moral tyranny that is truly human 'civilisation'; we know he's doomed. before the third millennium is 50 years old, wild simians will be hunted into extinction as bush meat, and their environment developed for agriculture and mineral exploitation to gratify insatiable human excess. in the end, it's a tale about ourselves. the path to extinction that other simians tread, must eventually be followed by humans. highly recommended for its ethical take, despite the hokey moments.\",\n"," 'i vividly remember the first time i watched this movie. the lead up to the finding of the old films was without any obvious clues, so it was not \\'til the richard

enormity of the project and could only surmise that the actors in the \"salome\" movie were also conned into thinking they were filming a real movie and did not know the truth until the \\'doco\\'

little of the film before seeing it and i was blown away by the premise and production quality. at first i had trouble discerning whether it was based on a true story or not, but i found as the film progressed that this became less and less relevant to my viewing experience. i was utterly enthralled in the first half of the film, the revelation that there might be something supernatural at play was realised beautifully, with some truly terrifying moments. this ghostly suggestion never overpowers the film; the story retains its dominant themes of grief and the process of grieving. the mise-en-scene was delightful, it was highly stylized and had real dreamy take on the horror conventions. for example the shots of the 'haunted' house might have been melodramatic and cliché, however this recurring image was often offset with the wheeling stars overhead, creating an ethereal quality that set it apart. i'd recommend this film to fans of psychological horror, its spooky, moody and satisfying with some great twists! spoiler alert! the twists in the second half of the film, though motivated and logical, were too redolent of twin peaks for me, so much that it detracted from my experience of lake mungo. not only is the dead girl alice palmer (laura palmer being the deceased subject of twin peaks) but she was a young woman with a double life which was only revealed after her death. she is quoted as being a girl who 'kept it secret that she had secrets', secrets which involved a lurid affair, visions of death, and the seedy underbelly of a quiet rural town. the clues are pieced together from new footage of the girl which keeps surfacing, the deceased girl even buried evidence that is later unearthed. for all those who have seen david lynch's fantastic series, all this will seem too familiar to ignore. the documentary style does give this similar story a new edge, as it lacks the indulgent melodrama of twin peaks. also the supernatural element sets it apart,and the revelation at the end is something really original. end spoiler i would have liked the nature of the element of 'video' more explored, what it means to be filmed, what kind of reality video can offer, can we trust video, can we trust our own eyes? these are notions which i think are suggested by the ironic documentary style of a fiction film but this is never really focused on. this is what was lacking for me, especially considering my qualms mentioned in the spoiler. but this film is miles ahead of modern horror and drama, 8/10.\",\n"," \"i rent horror flicks all the time, the campier the

miyazaki, for the seemingly unique mixture of kids-as-big-heroes, power-hungry sorcerers looking for the energy of the earth as the main source, machinery as the greatest evil, and many bizarrely defined, flamboyantly designed creatures (or yokai of the title). but there can also be comparisons made to star wars, especially to the gungan battle in tpm, and to the whole power-play between good and evil with similar forces. or to anime like samurai 7. or, of course, to henson\\'s films. and through all of these comparisons, and even through the flaws or over-reaching moments, it\\'s miike all the way with the sensibilities of effects and characters. here, ryunosuke kamiki plays tadashi, the prototypical kid who starts out sort of gullible and sensitive to things in the world, but will become the hero in a world going into darkness. the darkness is from an evil sorcerer, who gets his energy from all of the rage and wretched vibes in the human world, and who is also starting to put to death the spirits and other creatures, the yokhai, into a fire that sends them into gigantic robots that have only one mission- to destroy and kill anything in their paths. tadashi gets as pumped up to fight sato the sorcerer as the yokai once sato\\'s main minion and cohort, agi (kill bill\\'s chiaki kuriyama, another great villainies) steals tadashi\\'s little furry companion, a sunekosuri. soon, things come to a head, in a climax that brings to mind many other fantasy films and stories, but can only be contained, up to a point, by miike and his crew. i would probably recommend the great yokai war for kids, but in the forward note that it\\'s not some watered down fantasy in american circles. this has creatures galore, including a one-eyed umbrella stand, and a walking, talking wall, not to mention a turtle, a fire serpent, and a woman who became cursed by sato. so the variety is on high on that end, and one might almost feel like the creatures and effects- which grows to unfathomable heights when the \"festival\" hits with the yokai reaching hundreds of miles in scope. but there\\'s also a sense of fantasy being strong in both the light and the dark, and sunekosuri becomes perhaps the greatest emotional tool at miike\\'s disposal (and not just because it\\'s cuteness squared); where else to get an audience riled up than over a little furry ball of fury, who ends up in a tragic battle with tadashi in robot form? yet through all of this, the sense of anarchy that can be found in the brightest spots of miike\\'s career is here as well, which distinguishes it from its animated, muppet and sci-fi counterparts. there\\'s the bizarre humor as usual, including a song dedicated to akuzi beans at a crucial moment in the climax, and more than a few flights of fancy with the creatures and fight scenes (i loved, for example, the guy with the big blue head who has to make it smaller, or the anxious turtle-yokai). the biggest danger with miike\\'s access to bigger special effects and computer wizardry, which he flirts with, is overkill on this end. he\\'s got everything down, i am sure, with storyboards, and he creates some memorable impressions with some compositions (one of them is when all is said and done, and tadashi and the \\'other\\' human character are in the middle of the tokyo rubble in an overhead shot), but the cgi is sometimes a little unconvincing with the robots, and the interplay skirts on being too flamboyant, and some visuals, like the overlay of the yokai spreading the word about the big festival on the map, just seem weak and pat. i almost wondered if miike might dip into (bad) spy kids territory, quite frankly. but this liability aside, the great yokai war provides more than a share of excitement, goofy thrills, and innocent melodrama that came with many of the best childhood fantasies. it owes a lot to cinema, as well as traditional japanese folklore, but the screws are always turning even in its most ludicrous and veeringly confusing beats. it\\'s not the filmmaker at his very best, but working in experimentation in a commercial medium ends up working to his advantage. it\\'s got a neat little message, and lots of cool adventure. 7.5/10',\n"," 'for the life of me, i still can not figure out why traitor is getting such poor promotion, but if i were the studio i\\'d be trying my damnedest to

bourne ultimatem\", because this is clearly not true. while there is plenty of mystery and conspiracy to go around, this is a completely different situation that really makes the viewer think at the end of the movie. the great thing about traitor is the fact that politics are not heavy-handed or one-sided a la syriana or any of the other cookie cutter political thrillers out there. the film really allows the viewer to draw their one conclusions based their own individual moral compass. i would say that anyone who is not looking for just another michael bay-esquire popcorn flick should totally love traitor. -j.',\n"," \"i saw an advanced screening of this movie and it definitely is not as good as the first one with the rock (dwayne johnson). the first one was a really good movie.

django\" is pretty much what you would expect from a western by takashi miike... it\\'s violent, it\\'s funny, and it\\'s just plain weird at times. it looks kind of like the old west, except the buildings are distinctly japanese. it feels kind of like the old west, except some characters are in cowboy garb while others are in what appears to be feudal japanese american indian gang war duds. and the dialog? \"do not you know your shakespeare?\" there are two feuding families, the white & the red, and caught in between is our hero, whoever he is, and an old woman, her daughter, and a little boy. the daughter, having married outside of her clan, and the boy, of mixed background. the story itself is a bit hard to follow, but the action makes up for it. there\\'s a lot of gun play, a lot of crossbow play, and a lot of fancy shooting from both weapons, along with things like hitting one\\'s target through a hole just blown in one victim. and grandma, well, she\\'s apparently a highly trained martial arts & gunslinger kind of gal, and she learned from the best, ringo (quentin tarrentino) who also taught her how to make sukiyaki that was not so sweet. if you have seen all the old spaghetti westerns, this is a new twist on them that\\'s well worth seeing. there\\'s an astounding amount of wild and weird action, and there\\'s also some ridiculous comedic bits, like a bunch of men using the sheriff of the town as a shield, and looking exactly like a conga line. great action, interesting humor, and a decidedly different take on the western theme. plus, the japanese have a sense of poetry too, and there\\'s even a bit of room in here for that, before the action kicks in again. if you like miike & you like westerns that are quite a bit out of the ordinary, check this

the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kael's the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz - orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis' screenplay here. as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site, kael overstated her case. there are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of charles foster kane: the newsreel (representing ralston - the henry luce clone), thatcher's memoirs, bernstein, jed leland, susan alexander kane, and raymond the butler. each has his or her different slant on kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. and of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of kane's story. this method also leads to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident. this is not the situation in the power and the glory. yes, like kane it is about a legendary business leader - here it is tom garner (spencer tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. but there are only two narrators - they are garner's right hand man henry (ralph morgan) and his wife (sarah padden). this restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of kane in garner. henry, when he narrates, is talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. his wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in henry. typical example: although he worked his way up, tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later years. unions are troublemakers, and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. henry describes tom's confrontation with the union in a major walk-out, and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life. but henry's wife reminds him how tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the union's headquarters - killing many people). so we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black. i am not really knocking the power and the glory for not duplicating kane's success (few films do - including all of orson welles' other films), but i am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one's interest to the end. and thanks to the performances of tracy and colleen moore as his wife sally, the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home. when they marry, tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. but in america great business success comes at a cost. tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire (he expands it and improves it constantly). but it takes him away from home too much, and he loses touch with sally. and he also notices eve (helen vinson), the younger woman who becomes his mistress. when sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her. similarly tom too gets a full shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of henry). eve marries tom, and presents him with a son - but it turns out to be eve's son by tom's son tom jr. (philip trent). the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes tom to shoot himself. the film is not a total success - the action jumps at times unconvincingly. yet it does make the business seem real (note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line, and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). sturgis came from a wealthy background, so he could bring in this type of detail. so on the whole it is a first rate film. no citizen kane perhaps, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america.\",\n"," 'unlike other early adult movies such as deep throat and behind the green door, this fine combination of explicit sex and shoot \\'em up thrills gets little respect even from genre fans. this is largely due to the brutal nature of the film\\'s numerous rape sequences, commendably not of the \\'they may protest at first\\' variety. the story\\'s well detailed in the other comment you\\'ll find here, so i will not go into that. most of the performers here made very few films (save for levi richards who made tons) and even beautiful blonde barbara bourbon, who turns in some effective acting as well as the proud, resilient farmer\\'s wife fighting to protect her daughters from \\'a fate worse than death\\', only made a handful of x-rated appearances, most memorably of course in radley metzger\\'s timeless private afternoons of pamela mann. director \"david fleetwood\" is actually sixties schlock producer joe robertson (the crawling hand, the slime people, the agent for h.a.r.m.), so the flick\\'s inconspicuous professionalism in just about every aspect of production as well as narrative drive should come as no surprise. he went on to carve a niche for himself as \\'female\\' (for the face value crowd) porn director \"adele robbins\" with movies like sweet alice and innocent seduction. you may think that this early rape \\'n\\' revenge movie stands diametrically opposed to his later couples friendly numbers. anyone taking the effort to sit down and watch the film in its entirety will come to realize however that the female characters (bourbon\\'s in particular) are well drawn, not whining victims at all, perfectly capable of righting the wrongs inflicted upon them. so give this classic its due and allow it to take its rightful place in the pantheon alongside its more renowned genre brethren.',\n"," 'please, if you are thinking about renting this movie, do not. if you are thinking of watching a couple of

that my grandmother lizzette m. woodfin was hired as a stand-in for mary pickford during filming of several scenes including the \"cliff scene\". both women were small (5\\') in stature and both my

instance. furthermore, from what i can see the experiences documented in the film are by and large 'true' - if you read a. beevor's book 'stalingrad' you will know what i mean. the film is also successful in the sense that it does not allow character or plot to dominate it - it is simply a tale of survival, that attempts to depict the battle mainly from the ordinary (german) soldier's point

castle of blood is, in my estimation, one of the finest, although other reviewers have given it mixed ratings. in an odd sort of way it reminds of the more recent the others, which was in the theaters a couple of years ago. director antonio margheriti remade his own picture in 1970 titling it this time web of the spider (aka nella stretta morsa del ragno). why he did this i do not understand, although the remake starred anthony franciosa and klaus kinski and was very good in its own right. perhaps he saw a good story and wished to tailor it more to american audiences. i do not really know. it is interesting that he did the original in black and white and the remake in color. castle of blood is excellent italian gothic. la danza macabra is said to be an unpublished work of edgar allen poe, who \"appears\" in this film. poe and lord blackwood, owner of a haunted castle, bet american writer alan foster (george riviere) that he cannot spend all souls night in said castle and survive. foster eagerly accepts the bet but soon regrets it, for he is witness to a series of murders committed by ghosts. it seems that the ghosts come back to life once every few years but are doomed to re-enact the crimes they committed in life. lord blackwood conveniently forgot to tell foster that his blood is needed for them to resurrect themselves on the next all souls night! it does not take foster and the beautiful elisabeth blackwood (portrayed by the incomparable barbara steele) long to fall in love, even though their romance is doomed, because elisabeth is one of the ghosts. i will not give the ending away, but will just say that castle of blood is every bit a romantic tragedy as it is a horror story. comments. this film is greatly atmospheric, even by the excellent standards of the italians. my personal opinion is they do true horror better than anybody, and the somewhat dim black and white filming only enhances this. in fairness, web of the spider was fine in its own right, even with color and greater brightness. i loved the lingering shots, something most modern day directors do not have the patience for. indeed, when alan first enters the doomed castle, we are treated to several minutes of him doing nothing but roaming around from room to room, the dread ands unease building in his face and mannerisms. by the time the first ghost appears, the audience is thoroughly primed and ready. there is wonderful dialogue between alan and the ghosts, something else not often done in standard ghost stories. there are also memorable scenes, very visual for this type of film. elisabeth\\'s \"murder\" and the dance scene (reminds somewhat of the similar dance of the ghouls in 1962\\'s carnival of souls) were particularly good. sadly, few general interest viewers will ever

borchardt who is... how can i put it ? rather self deluded ? yes but that\\'s not necessarily a bad thing since if we had no dreams we\\'d all still be living in caves and the fact that mark is obsessed with horror movies is not to be taken as a criticism since both sam raimi ( yes that one ) and peter jackson ( yes that one ) both started out doing low budget horror comedies so again it\\'s

\" come into my office because you are f**in\\' fired \" ) ? well that\\'s who mark resembles along with most of jerry springer\\'s guests so it\\'s very easy to see why some people thought this was

grief and are uncomfortable expressing themselves. this movie drew a lump to my throat the size of a golf ball and made me hug my son extra hard at bedtime. michelle williams gives another outstanding

would have never been allowed after 1934-5, this film fully immersed itself in a very sordid yet entertaining plot from start to finish. the conventional morality of the late 30s and 40s was definitely not evident in this film, as the film is essentially about a conniving woman who sleeps her way to the top--and with no apologies along the way. this \"broad\" both enjoyed sex and used it on every man who could help her get rich--something you just never would have seen in films made just two or three years later. the film begins with barbara stanwyck working in her father\\'s speakeasy. in addition to being her boss, he is also her pimp and encourages her to sleep with a local government official so that he\\'ll allow the illegal bar to operate with impunity. while not especially clear here, it appears as if daddy has been \"renting\" his daughter\\'s body out for a long time. however, after nearly being raped and attacking this man by breaking a bottle of beer over his skull, barbara has had enough and heads to the big city. it does not hurt that the still blew up and killed her father, but her feeling that she was whoring herself out and had nothing to show for it appeared to be the impetus to move. despite the depression, barbara uses sex to get a job at a huge mega-bank. she starts out at a pretty menial job as a file clerk, but in the space of what seems like just a few weeks, she sleeps her way from one job to another to yet another--until she is sleeping with the head of the bank and his future son-in-law! this all ends in tragedy, but babs does not seem too shook up over the deaths of these two men. in fact, some time later, she is able to insinuate herself into the life of the new ceo and once again she\\'s on top (perhaps in more way than one). now so far, this is a wonderful movie because it was so gritty and unrepentant. barbara played a 100% sociopath--a woman with no morality and no conscience--just a desire to squeeze as much out of life as she could no matter who she hurt in the process. however, the brave writers and producer \"chickened out\" and thought it important to tack on a redemptive ending. considering that this woman was so evil and conniving, her change of heart at the end was a major disappointment and strongly detracted from the film. in many ways, this reminded me of the ending of jezebel--as once again, a wicked person somehow \"sees the light\" and changes at the not-too-convincing conclusion. my advice is to try watching red-headed woman and downstairs. red-headed woman is much like baby face but features no magical transformation at the end--the leading lady really is a skunk down deep! in downstairs, a film very much like red-headed woman, the roles are reversed and a man (john gilbert) plays a similar conniving character. both are classics and a bit better than this film. this film is an amazing curio of a brief period of often ultra-sleazy hollywood films and in this light it\\'s well worth seeing for cinephiles. also, fans of the duke take note--john wayne plays a very small part in the film and it\\'s very unusual to see a very young wayne playing such a conventional role.',\n"," \"in 1983, director brian de palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an american gangster, and that he did-- with the help of a terrific screenplay by oliver stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast. the result was `scarface,' starring al pacino in one of his most memorable roles. the story begins in may of 1980, when castro opened the harbor at mariel, cuba, to allow cuban nationals to join their families in the united states. 125,000 left cuba at that time, for the greener pastures of freedom in america, and most were honest, hard-working people, thankful for the opportunity they had been granted. but not all. among the `marielitos' who streamed into florida, approximately 25,000 had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of cuba's jails-- criminals considered beyond redemption, who castro had merely wanted to be rid of. and they, too, saw america as a land of opportunity, even as al capone had considered chicago some fifty years earlier. and among the most ambitious was a man named tony montana (pacino), known to his associates as `caracortada.' scarface. now that he was free of the yoke of communism under which he had grown up, montana wanted what he felt was coming to him, and he wanted it now; and from the moment he stepped off the boat in florida, he was determined to have it all. wealth and power-- that was montana's dream, and he would get it by doing what he did best, beginning with a favor for a man living in miami by the name of frank lopez (robert loggia). lopez, it seems, had a brother in cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of castro's goons, a man who, having outlived his usefulness to castro, had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in `little havana,' along with montana and all of the cubans just off the boats, where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives. and in short order, montana sees to it that lopez's brother has been avenged, and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of america. lopez, a wealthy businessman with the right connections, in return for the favor gets montana and his friend, manny (steven bauer), released from the holding camp, and puts them to work. in his day, capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain, but lopez has the modern day equivalent, and it's even more lucrative: cocaine. lopez takes montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into the life, but once he has a taste of it, montana is not satisfied with whatever crumbs lopez sees fit to throw his way, and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be: at the `top.' with a cold-blooded, iron will, montana decides he'll do whatever it takes to get there, no matter what the cost. but before it's over, he will realize the price for his dream, and he'll pay it; but for a brief moment, perhaps he will know what it's like to be the man. and he will also know whether or not it was worth it. in step with de palma's vision, pacino plays montana larger-than-life, and he does it beautifully. from the accent he affects (which he researched thoroughly to make sure he got it right-- and he did), to the body language and the attitude, he's got it all, and it makes montana convincing and very real. what he brings to the role is nuance and style, in a way that few actors (de niro would be one) can. this is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way, nor is there anything about montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level; but pacino's screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character, even though it's hard to become emotionally involved with him. it's quite simply a dynamic, memorable performance. michelle pfeiffer gives a solid performance, as well, in the role that put her on the path to stardom. as elvira, the woman who becomes an integral part of montana's dream, pfeiffer is subtle and understated, giving that sense of something going on underneath, while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior countenance. she, like pacino, definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly glides across the screen with a stoic, enigmatic and sultry demeanor. the supporting cast includes mary elizabeth mastrantonio (gina), miriam colon (mama montana), f. murray abraham (omar), paul shenar (sosa) and harris yulin (bernstein). an excellent precursor to the more recent and highly acclaimed `traffic,' and `blow,' and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of peckinpah's `the wild bunch,' de palma's `scarface,' originally panned by critics, has since been cited by many as being the definitive american gangster saga. much of the violence is implied rather than graphic, but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing. but if you stay with it, there is a lesson to be learned in the end. and like many lessons in life, the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time. but the reward is always worth it, and that's the way it is with this film. i rate this one 8/10.\",\n"," \"just saw this exquisite 1982 movie return of the soldier, based on rebecca west's novel. its about a shell-shocked fortyish captain who does not even tell his wife he has returned to british soil, but remains in a hospital in london. he's lost his memory and is a boy again, with a lingering yen for the lower class sweetheart he pursued 25 years earlier. its a delicate story. he is lingering in his boyhood, while the reader discovers his wife is an unbearable, aspiring socialite who wants him to resume his place in society. living with them is his cousin jenny, who loved chris baldry the soldier, when they were growing up as playmates, but has settled into spinsterhood. the lower class woman, played by glenda jackson, is margaret gray. it is she who is notified that chris is back in england. chris' wife kitty is shocked when mrs. gray comes to tell her that chris is in a hospital in london. kitty (julie christie) is vacuous and snobbish. why, she asks herself, was this other woman sent a telegraph about chris rather than her? chris has forgotten totally about kitty. he wants to renew his relationship with margaret. the now married margaret is reluctant to meet him, but then does and continues to meet with him. there is a psychiatrist (ian holm) who warns kitty and jenny that chris' temporary happiness with margaret will disappear if he 'cures' him. jenny realizes how empty kitty is for chris and forms a secret loving alliance through margaret. they both are in love with him. jenny wants to help. late in the film kitty reveals that chris and she had a boy who died five years ago. telling chris this, weighs the shrink, will certainly restore him to 'normal.' but is this a good idea? chris, barely aware that he and kitty were ever married, is unaware of his child and the child's death. the psychiatrist, just learning of the child, believes such knowledge will restore chris. jenny and margaret have chris all to themselves because kitty believes he is faking and refuses to accept chris's illness in reverting to his youth in his forties. the film leaves her mostly out of consideration concerning whats to be done with chris. but jenny and margaret, in the child's perfectly maintained bedroom- with kitty too in the novel, but not in the screenplay- discuss what they believe should be done about chris from their separate perspectives. margaret is the critical one here, because, though married, she has half fallen in love with chris again. jenny's social stature, jenny believes, will be threatened if chris does not right himself. she does not reveal this to margaret, however. margaret decides, looking ahead, that chris cannot maintain his fantasy over time, but must return to something like a real life. while kitty and jenny look on from the window of the house, margaret approaches chris outside and tells him of his lost son. the buoyant war victim's head sinks, his shoulders slump, he looks away. he walks dejectedly toward the house. fin i read some criticism of this first novel of rebecca west. the novel was written something after the first war. the movie is never quite clear who jenny is, his cousin or his sister. it would be more rousing if she were his sister, of course. the criticism does not make it clear either. i am sure west in her novel, makes sure jenny is her cousin, not her sister. west is no henry miller nor an anais nin, whose book incest (about her relationship with her father as an adult to get even with him for molesting her as a child) i considered reading, but then decided against. rebecca the author has a need to restore chris too. she too has outposts in her head for the society her novel excoriates first but finally embraces once more.\",\n"," 'hey you wanna know what i hate? lines of dialogue like this: \"you been away from the dark realm a while, chels, how\\'d it feel playin\\' again?\" \"just like any other ultra-violent twenty-four hour wildly popular and yet utterly purposeless embraced-by-the-masses internet role-playing game.\" it\\'s one of those lines of dialogue that they always put into movies like hellraiser 8 that are impossible to avoid sounding like they were written and re-written and rehearsed and re- rehearsed and then finally they just give up trying to make it sound natural after 30 or 40 takes and, exasperated, just drop the best bad take into the movie. that, being said, let me tell you what i have figured out. after years if deliberation about what it takes to make a good horror movie and what is missing in a bad one, after countless theories (the presence of teenagers or college-age kids being near the top of that list, by the way), i have finally discovered for certain the exact point at which a movie stops being scary and good and instantly becomes stupid and bad. there is a perfect illustration of the solution near the end of this film, when chelsea gets locked in the room and adam starts calling to her from under the floor. she has becomes absorbed in some photo album despite having found herself locked into the creepiest attic imaginable, and she hears someone whispering her name from behind her. she spins around just in time to see a hand disappear beneath a crack in the floorboards, and she cautiously moves over to investigate. as she peers into the hole, she continues to hear her name being called and she can see the tiniest glimpse of a face in the darkness, and at this point i am absolutely cringing in my chair. no matter how sure i am that something is going to spring out in a situation like that it still gets to me. and then she did something stupid. literally the instant chelsea put her hand through that crack in the floorboards, i immediately relaxed, almost to the point of breathing a sigh of relief because i did not have to worry anymore because i completely stopped caring. and it\\'s not just because she does not realize she\\'s in a horror movie (despite the fact that the entire cast of this movie are hardcore hellraiser fans, so the fourth wall has already been breached), it\\'s because the moment her hand crosses the threshold of that crack in the boards she instantly ceases to be a victim. and you know what my analogy is? suicide! when someone in a horror movie does something that stupid, it is generally because the filmmakers need to have the character killed off but can not think of a really clever way to have it happen, so they just have the character do something monumentally stupid, but the problem is that this places the blame for their death on themselves, and in a horror movie, it\\'s not only not scary when someone is attacked after doing something as idiotic as putting her hand through the crack in the floorboards because she thinks she sees her dead friend down there, it\\'s satisfying, and not in the good way either. stupidity should be painful, but in the movies, it should be lethal. that being said, it\\'s amazing how little effort was made into making it clear what exactly was going on in the movie. it starts out with the funeral of a college age kid having been killed because of his over-involvement in something called hellworld, which itself is never very clearly explained. his friends later mourn that they all knew what was happening to him but still kept playing hellworld, although if you watch the making-of featurettes on the dvd, director rick bota refers to hellworld as \"a website, or video game.\" it\\'s kind of an ominous sign when even the director does not know what his movie is about. either that or he does not know the difference between a website and a video game. the story follows the death of their friend, something about that game, and then cuts to a few years later when all of his friends get invited to a party celebrating the said video game. needless to say, it\\'s kind of like an overblown halloween party where everyone seems to be fascinated with the macabre (serious macabre, too, like dead babies in jars, sounds like a blast), and girls randomly pull their breasts out (curiously, the first bit of wildly gratuitous nudity is followed by the following exchange \"gratuitous breasts?\" \"necessary breasts! ha ha ha!\" clever.). when all is said and done and you finally realize what has been happening throughout the entire movie, it is such a ludicrous and ridiculous twist that it distantly surpasses the saw movies for absurdity. if you thought jigsaw had some time on his hands to come up with some incredibly complex machines of torture, wait until you see the plot that is hatched by the host (played by lance henriksen, who wastes his talent completely in this movie). also do not miss the making-of featurette on the dvd, in which you can witness pinhead eating a piece of pizza and, my favorite, khary payton, one of the actors in the film, makes the following mysterious analogy \"horror movies are like roller coasters, you know, they are not gonna win oscars or that kind of thing, but they are just a lot of fun.\" i do not know, khary, have you ridden xtreme at magic mountain in southern california? i see an oscar in that ride\\'s

say the film is dated per se. it's just that melvin is not cynical at all and he does not seem to have a hateful bone in his body. he's neither a wimp nor a man of intellect but someone whose basic humanity emanates. what helps the film, too, is the pairing of actors paul lemat as melvin, and mary steenburgen as melvin's wife, linda -- they are an endearing couple. i attribute the film's memorable tone and spirit to not only the actors (including jason robards & some of the supporting cast) -- i like to believe that director, jonathan demme, put his stamp on this, too. now in retrospect am learning that the writer (bo goldman) probably deserves some kudos.\",\n"," \"the petrified forest is a philosophically romantic story of life in the most desolate places, hence the title. it's set in the petrified forest area in northern arizona. an intellectual hitchhiker played by trevor howard drifts into a roadside diner run by a proud, traditionalist man, his dreamy daughter bette davis, and her grandfather, an old man with a lot of stories about the old days and a fascination with outlaws. when davis's mother moved back to france when she was a young child, she felt like everything in her heart moved there with her, leaving her an empty shell of herself living with her stern, purist father. davis reads poetry, dreams about visiting bourges and wants to study art. but she's in a dry, dead nowhere working a tedious job and being pursued stubbornly by hunky jocks. when howard arrives, he is so much more schooled and wise, having been all around the world, and by that mere background, he draws naturally in to conversation with strangers beyond small talk and eventually focuses in on the one fit to enter his adventurous, idealistic, strangely humble existence. that eventual focus is the character of bette davis, his lone waitress, out of her element, to whom he expresses interest in seeing her paintings and hearing her recite her favorite poem. to howard, who appears to sees himself as an unsuccessful writer, she is the future and he finds her enthusiasm and optimism both endearing and revitalizing. hurtling headlong into this nonentity of a world is humphrey bogart, nailing the rotten-to- the-core persona of his character, a wanted gangster, who with his gang of ruffians, holds everyone in the diner hostage. however, some of life's dead skin has been blistered and peeled back. trevor howard gets to the heart of exchanging stimulating words with the stoic villain of bogart, and makes an agreement with him. with davis out of the room by chance, howard signs over an insurance policy to her and asks bogie to shoot him. his rationalization is that he is of no use to a rose in need of watering like davis if he is alive. the world simply does not seem as if to work that way. if he is dead, however, she can live her dreams. like howard's individualist protagonist, the film is a profound compromise. it does not settle for a film noir. it does not settle for a love story. even involving one's subject matter with another's in the same plot may remain within one genre, one conventional environment. by not so much combining the two but rather looking both ways in perceiving an impression of the world, robert e. sherwood and those who adapted his play, stages a confrontation between the two outlooks, holding them up side by side and relating their shocking compatibility. that is what is very special about the petrified forest. for a picture made in the 1930s, it is exceptionally written and acted, a timeless work of eagerness and tenderness amidst peers which were poles apart.\",\n"," 'true love, i truly enjoyed and loved this movie. it was fun, funny and inspirational. i just saw it on dvd. how did i miss this

surrealism makes the body uncomfortable, yet you can not lay your eyes off of it. based off of joseph conrad\\'s heart of darkness, apocalypse now slowly descends its protagonist, willard (martin sheen) into madness, most likely the same way kurtz plunged into insanity. the production of this film is notorious for its delays provided by the monsoon season and for brando\\'s unprepared performance (he read his lines from cue cards). there is a documentary titled apocalypse now: a filmmakers apocalypse which shows the hell everyone went through in making this. the opening sequence is one of the most famous and popular in any film. as the blade of the helicopters are heard in slow motion and napalm is dropped in the trees, the song \"the end\" by the doors can be heard. the next shot is of willard in his bed with the fan on, so the noise of the helicopter coincides with the fan. we are informed that he does special missions for the military, mostly assassinations. when his next mission is given to him, he is baffled. \"charging a man with murder here is like giving a speeding ticket in the indy 500.\" the man he has to kill was a respected colonel that has gone insane and isolated himself along with tribes people. kurtz is ordering atrocious acts that are carried out by these people and he must me stopped. willard does not go alone however. he is carried on a boat with several soldiers and they come across several battles. along the way, they meet lieutenant colonel bill kilgore \"hoorah\" about the war. willard ponders that if kilgore is that crazy, what could kurtz be like. there are many scenes that portray willards plunge into insanity: the tiger attack, the slaughter of innocent vietnamese, the nonstop rain, the piled dead bodies scattered about, and the deaths of his crew members. when he reaches the kurtz compound, he is greeted by the village people and a hippie photojournalist (dennis hopper). instead of assassinating kurtz right away, willard begins talking with him and his conscience begins to doubt what he should do. kurtz, on the other hand wants to die. he is tired of the war and wants to go down as a soldier. willard kills him with a machete while in unison, a buffalo is sacrificed with several machetes by the people. once they realize their leader has been slain, instead of killing willard, they hail him as their new king. willard rejects the offer and leaves them. the cinematography here is absolutely breathtaking. the colors are grain free, something that is rare in older movies. i can watch it muted and admire the beauty of the scenery. the acting ensemble is terrific, with everyone playing their parts well. many criticize brando for some reason, but i think he nails his role as a depressed lunatic who is beaten up by the war. the soundtrack and the score are haunting, and provide the mood for the film. i am wondering what instrument they used in that guitar-like sound when the credits roll? there have been many parodies of this film, but my favorite quote comes from marge simpson when she explains to homer why a character with the same name on a police show is behaving like an idiot: \"your character provides comic relief for the show, like um, marlon brando in apocalypse now.\" those who have seen the movie know why this is hilarious.',\n"," \"without comparing this to any other zombie film out there, this was one of the worst movies i have ever watched. the acting was bad, and that could be attributed to this being the actors first film ever. the lighting was very very bad, it appears throughout the movie that they are trying to use natural lighting, if that's the case, why shoot the film in shady areas or late in the day? most of the time you can not see the actors expressions or faces because of the shadows. the special effects are horrible in most places, sometimes the blood is red, sometimes it's black. you see a lot of blood that looks black and congealed running out of one wound while there's fresh red blood running out of another wound (this being on the same body at the same time). the story does not run very smoothly at all with dialog being forced to move the plot along. one or two of these things in an independent movie is not enough to kill it, if the remaining factors are strong enough to carry the weak points of the film. when you have all negative points in one movie, the movie sucks. if you do compare this to other low budget zombie movies out there (braindead or dead and breakfast to name two), it does not even begin to compare and ends up looking like a high school students weekend project that is paid for with his allowance. bottom line: do not rent, do not buy, if it's on cable late at night watch an infomercial

mechanics of the movie - just the characters and events that this film portrayed. the cinematics - beautiful scenery etc (to show that man really has no sense at all - he can be surrounded by some of the most amazingly beautiful surroundings and still turn the place to hell) and sound (the gunshots / ambient stuff etc were very well done) were all spot on.. for the actual plot, the other comments posted are a lot more lucid than mine, so i will not bother trying to explain the premise of this flick. i really do not know what else to say - some of the scenes containing brutality were brilliant (in a really horrible way) - none of the usual hollywood (tm) bad guy finally gets it in the end type stuff - cliche - it really just showed how pointless these kinds of conflicts are. cliche oh man - this film is going to stick with me for quite some time. and i kind of wish it did not. i was after a throw away movie (should have rented sphere) and instead got this thing that i just cannot stop

gayest of all cgi monsters ever made along with the fact it of course was impervious to bullets and bombs (otherwise it would not have been made for the military duh!). by far the best scene was when lizzy mcguire's brother runs into the shack and the dinocroc eats him causing his head to pop clean off with a popping noise i might add. i believe that you would be better off shooting yourself between the eyes then to watch dinocroc. and as for the director i believe that we should get a bunch of people to hang him by a noose and all take turns kicking him in the crotch for wasting an hour

(camille) from the mouth of my mother when i was still an upper primary school girl. to a young chinese girl, this meant nothing at all but i went to the public library and found that there were many copies with this title translated by taiwanese. i never finished reading it because the names are too long and the chinese is too literary, i was bored to death by it. the only thing i remembered was that it was a french novel. dropped, the book, but not the name. a few years later in the early 80\\'s, franco zeffirelli\\'s operatic movie with chinese title as \"cha fa nui\" was on show in one and only one movie house, \"palace\" at causeway bay (demolished!). at that time, this prestigious cinema showed mostly western movies of big names like gone with the wind, casablanca, dr. zhivago and so \"la traviata\" was one of them. hong kong chinese were then not very familiar with western culture, the cinema staff had even misplaced plácido domingo\\'s name as \"domingo plácido\" on the billboard. i, as a teenager, was a little intimidated by the movie house by its reputation and grandeur. yet, out of curiosity, in those fearless, carefree and innocent days, imitating the adults with good taste, i bought a ticket to see this movie. and it was a wow, what an eye-opening experience! the vision, the music, the powerful opera singing, the acting and the poetic cinematography, the wondrous costumes and hairdo, it was an educational adventure to a young life.

celluloid trash that some are making it out to be. keeping in the stoner-addled tradition of things in fact, one may even squeeze off a few scatological belly laughs in the otherwise depressingly low-brow, low budget affair. apparently it boils down to this: writer/director bob saget has a lot of friends in hollywood. they may not all be on top of their game, many even out of the limelight for some time, but a common friend indeed they have with their oft-ridiculed, former television dork dad. what saget gets to exploit out of this is a plethora of b-listers, which makes for an impressive cast on paper.but do not be fooled. on top of the disengaging sound quality which reeks of home studio, almost all of the frequent one line cameos done by celebrities are so apathetically subdued that one cannot help but think most of these people are phoning in a favor to an old hollywood friend, with absolutely no intention on getting any attention in this project; who can blame them? even at 80 minutes, relying on a low grade stash of penguin stock footage in order to manipulate a crude plot into this joke must have sounded drastically unappealing to most participants. thankfully a few of saget's crew actually rise to the occasion, that is to say that they do not let their hubris get in the way of embracing the full-on stupidity of the project. it is in those low-fi moments of tasteless class that a few voice actors and the rancid production actually get to shine in it's context. samuel l. jackson, as the narrator was an excellent choice, although even his central dialog feels like his head is somewhere else (to the scripts credit, they actually throw in a joke to echo this sentiment). the only other voice actors that make an earnest contribution to this goof are lewis black (who thankfully had a large role) and tracey morgan, making all other voice actors seem completely indifferent. for the few genuinely hilarious moments that reached further then this trite

same theme of the show must go on. in addition to keeler and powell the films featured the kaleidiscopic choreography of busby berkeley, show stopping tunes and many of the same supporting players. all are arguably classics of their genre but i must admit a clear preference for footlight due to it's pace energy and lead james cagney. warren william in gold diggers and warner baxter in 42nd street acquit themselves admirably as the shows production heads- particularly baxter as the burned out julian marsh in search of one last box office smash. both lack the infectious energy of cagney however, who perfectly compliments the frenetic pace of putting on a broadway musical. he is an absolute whirlwind as he deals with production numbers, unscrupulous partners and a gold digging girlfriend. of course cagney alone does not make footlight the classic that it is. the script crackles with some sharp double entendres delivered by a superlative supporting cast featuring frank mchugh, hugh herbert, guy kibbee and especially joan blondell who cuts everyone down to size. busby berkeley's dance numbers are surreal, suggestive and risqué and done just in the nick of time before the arrival of the hollywood code in 34. sadly, the thirties and sometime beyond would never see such a richly made musical with the verve and sass of footlight again. gentility and morality made sure

kid that crawled through the air vent to get every where, why could not he just walk? i would never recommend this movie to anyone unless you have to watch and even then i am still sorry for you. the up side to the movie contagion is that it was actually kind of amusing at some points in the movie, and i believe that it was not suppose to be funny. i loved how when one of the doctors was studying

is bad because they play some really bad movies on there.',\n"," 'let\\'s get things straight. i was raised catholic, and in a very religious family, and spent as much time at church and talking to priests as at home. that was useful for two things: to make a convinced atheist out of me, and to give me deep, insightful knowledge about the church and its dogmas. and i say: if a catholic priest witnesses a murder, and clearly sees the face of the killer, he can report it to the police, even if the murderer has confessed to him afterwards. he can not reveal what he\\'s told in confession, but he can talk about anything he sees outside that, and confession is useless to keep his mouth shut. so, here we have a movie entirely sustained on a lie. and another lie is there\\'s no absolution for murder. according to the catholic church, there\\'s absolution for any sin as long as there\\'s sincere repentance. so far, the biggest plot holes in this weak thriller. as people frequently say, this movie would have improved if bob hoskins and alan bates had switched roles. hoskins is naturally suitable to play gangsters (i will never lament enough that he lost al capone in favor of one of de niro\\'s weakest performances in \"the untouchables\") and bates\\' features would have been perfect as the priest with a gray past. but above that, i think the film would have been much better had real-life ulster native liam neeson (back then mostly unknown to big audiences) played mickey rourke\\'s part. not only his face is perfect to play tormented characters, but he\\'d make us believe the character as real, something rourke just can not. back in the 80s, rourke was not a bad actor (afterwards he seemed to lose his talent along with his looks), but he was one of those performers, like brad dourif, who\\'s as good as the director he works with. and as a former ira terrorist, rourke\\'s acting comes across more like a pimp. sad to think that, had this movie been made just some three to six years later (when neeson achieved moderate celebrity status in 1990 with sam raimi\\'s enjoyable \"darkman\", and superstardom in 1993 with \"schindler\\'s list\", while rourke became pretty much of a forgotten has-been), liam and mickey could have switched parts to greater benefit (rourke would have been effective in the supporting role of docherty, but just can not carry this movie along as the lead). yet another missed opportunity, and yet another film with the potential of being a classic, that became instantly forgettable fare. ironically enough, the often criticized score (by underrated composer bill conti) worked for me. i did not find it overly-melodramatic, but suitably gritty and beautiful. it reminded me of howard shore\\'s score for \"the silence of the lambs\". here\\'s to mike hodges\\' talent, who made \"get carter\", yes, but do not forget he\\'s the mastermind behind \"flash gordon\" as well... it seems the film was massacred in the cutting room (it shows, as some parts are really choppy and confusing, and others just do not glue) and a director\\'s cut is waiting to see the light. ok, but i seriously doubt that will make it a great movie, as we\\'ll still have the bad casting and the false premise there. 4/10.',\n"," 'despite this film having one of the more amazing groups of character actors for support, this is truly an awful film. it

'legendary movie producer walt disney brought three of the world\\'s greatest fairy tales to the screen. they remain among the most popular animated films of all time. the first was his groundbreaking classic \"snow white and the seven dwarfs\" released in 1937. the last was the then-under appreciated \"sleeping beauty\" which made it\\'s debut in 1959. in between these two was perhaps his most satisfying adaptation of a classic fairy tale: \"cinderella\" (1950). of the three films, \"cinderella\" is the one most faithful to its origins. ironically, unlike \"snow white\", which for better or worse, became for many the definitive version of the story. \"cinderella\" did not follow the same path. although it was a hit and, like \"snow white\", was responsible for restoring the dwindling disney fortunes, it never achieved the same audience recognition which it certainly deserved. disney, for once, did himself proud, electing not to tamper with a classic, instead elaborating and adding substance to the tale, rather than rewriting it for the screen. the result was enchanting. a combination of superb animation (in beautifully soft technicolor) and the perfect voice talents brought the story to life with a radiance that endures to this day. ilene woods, who was a radio performer, recorded demonstration discs of the songs as a favor to the authors of the material, al hoffman, mack david, and jerry livingston. when disney heard them, he knew he had found his cinderella. and indeed he had. woods heartfelt renditions of \"a dream is a wish your heart makes\", \"so this is love\" and \"oh sing sweet nightingale\" are perfect. eleanor audley, who would go on to voice maleficent in \"sleeping beauty\", masterfully captured the icy cruelty of the stepmother, while rhoda williams and lucille bliss were convincingly nasty stepsisters. luis van rooten admirably performed as both the king and the grand duke, and james macdonald was endearing as both jaq and gus, cinderella\\'s devoted mice. william phipps has little dialog as the prince (future talk show host mike douglas provided his singing voice) but film (and disney) veteran, verna felton was born to play the fairy godmother, and she made the best number, (the oscar-nominated \"bibbidi-bobbidi-boo\") her own show-stopper. among the artists responsible for the \"look\" of the film, was mary blair, whose inspired use of color was greatly admired by disney. her elegant french-period backgrounds add tremendously to the quality of the movie. but, most important of all\\' are the believable characters--from cinderella, right down to lucifer, the stepmother\\'s deliciously evil cat. they bring both life and vibrancy to the often told story, something very difficult to create in an animated film. in conjunction with the film\\'s 55-year anniversary, (and, not so coincidentally, the coming holiday season) \"cinderella\" has just been released on a special edition dvd. it simply has never looked better. the fully restored film must be seen to be appreciated--suffice it to say, it looks wonderful. an enhanced stereo soundtrack has been added, and serves the music well. the dvd extras, now a standard part of disney platinum editions, are too numerous to list here, but as usual, some are directed towards children, some are slanted to adults, and the rest fall somewhere in between. but real fans will want to get the deluxe gift set, because, along with an actual cell from the film and eight character sketches, it includes a 160-page hardback book, which not only incorporates most of the material found in the book with the 1995 special edition home video release, but much more as well. as usual for disney, \"cinderella\" will only be available for a limited time. so, if like me, you

children's movie to be excellent and a must-see for the entire family 10/10\",\n"," 'i am surprised at seeing how highly regarded this version of victor hugo\\'s classic novel is. true, it\\'s very faithful to the book (even if unavoidably leaving some things out), but that\\'s about its only virtue. victor hugo did not call his story \"les misérables\" for no reason. he wanted to point out and denounce misery and its causes and consequences. but nothing of that is in this film version. it seems a lot like a 1950s hollywood romance movie, a mgm musical, or in the best of cases, something along the lines of the trapp family. everybody looks too healthy, clean and well-fed, and more middle class than poor, and the darkest aspects of the plot have been eliminated (with the result of one of my favorite parts of the story, the fall of fantine into the lowest levels of humiliation in order to get money for her daughter, being totally absent from the film). i expected the characters to start singing and dancing in any moment! as for the cast, the only one i really liked was silvia monfort as eponine, who gives the character a very welcome mundane feel. jean gabin lacks energy as valjean, with results of making his more active scenes (specially the one when he liberates himself from the chains to save the life of a fellow prisoner, and the one where he frees himself again, this time from thénardier and his other captors) seem false and almost laughable. bernard blier, with his inexpressive face, is a weak javert, and the fact that this character is criminally underdeveloped does not help either. the rest of the cast is adequate enough, with the exception of fantine, who is just plain awful, and seems right out of mervyn leroy\\'s \"little women\". fantine\\'s role has been reduced to just a cameo, and i have not decided if this is a good or bad thing, because the interpretation of the character could not be more wrong. there is also too much use of an unnecessary voiceover narration that hurts more than enhances the story. overall, it all lacks hugo\\'s main point, and, despite the almost textual faithfulness to the book, i\\'d have preferred that it had changed more of the plot but had staid truer to the central theme, than this, the other way around. i can not rate this film higher than 4/10. for a masterful adaptation that truly does the book justice, check the brilliant robert hossein version starring lino ventura as valjean.',\n"," 'this turned out to be a very good movie. the story is intriguing, and i wonder if it must have been based on reality, somewhat. the only problem is there was the big film- \"the devil\\'s advocate\" with keanu reeves and al pacino- (totally different plot though) so it may confuse the viewer, thinking these are similar films, and thus, not tuning in. that aside, ken olin is excellent in this film, as the defense attorney who must defend basketball star, joe campbell (portrayed by holt mccallany). i have seen mccallany in one or two smaller films, and he was excellent in this. the case which olin prepares so well, and wins turns out to be a possible mistake. what if the defendant really did rape these girls? what kind of person is he? what is he capable of?. mariska hargitay is also good as olin\\'s assistant. there is a small role for deanna milligan (\"intensity\" 1997) and gina philips is olin\\'s daughter, who becomes involved with joe campbell (mccallany). while the ending was not overly suspenseful, this film addresses the many flaws in our legal system, and psychological issues which cannot be assessed by the courts.',\n"," 'i expected to enjoy a romantic comedy featuring hip hop, but was disappointed on many levels. first of all, the story is so badly recycled as to make it almost unbearable. second, the setting, acting and story are not very authentic or believable. third, there are a lot more good black actors to choose from than these standard picks. how about some originality? third, there were very few hip hop songs played in entirity - if any. none seemd really central. overall, film was a great disappointment, but the editing style was very interesting and almost made the film worthwhile.',\n"," 'i only half-watched this, it was pretty bad. a group of four high school girls who\\'ve been raped by men team up to kill men, including the movie\\'s narrator. throughout the movie, a gong appears and is gonged whenever there is going to be a violent scene: the \"gore gong.\" there is also a \"hooter honker,\" which is a pair of bulb-type bicycle horns. this is really stupid, and about the level of humor in the movie. as in gorman bechard\\'s other movies, this is set in waterbury, connecticut, has carmine capobianco in it, has characters talking to the camera, and has at least one scene set in a video store. i do not know if his more recent movies have these features; i am hoping he\\'s gotten better. the title \"cemetery high\" and the video box cover of women in scanty clothing in a graveyard, one holding a bloody chainsaw, is misleading. i do not recall a scene in a graveyard. i guess it refers more to the fact that high schoolers are killing lots of people. a bumbling mayor, policeman, and coroner try to figure out who the \"scumbusters\" are, although two of them destroy some evidence. maybe if i was paying more attention i would have known why, if it was incompetence, or if they were covering for the women for some reason. mainly, it\\'s just boring with lame humor.',\n"," '... and that\\'s a goddamn shame! please make the sun rise and have it incinerate all copies of dracula 3000. this must be the worst vampire-flick of the new millennium so far (i have not seen reign in darkness yet, but they do not get much worse than this). do not be fooled be the movie\\'s cool h.r. gigeresque cover. this is so bad, it\\'s almost hilarious. i can not describe all the emotions this movie conjured. i laughed my ass off, i yelled at the screen, i sat there numb, nodding my head in disbelief,... this film has \\'cheap & cheese\\' written all over it. the best thing of this movie are the opening-credits and the opening-shots which feature more or less okay cgi of two space-ships. but when casper van dien\\'s voice-over comes on, you start smelling something fishy. and, indeed, it all goes downhill rapidly after that. the crew of a salvage-spaceship finds an abandoned vessel, the demeter, which seems to be heading for earth. they enter it, thus sealing their fate. this movie is, above all things, a shameless low-budget alien-rip-off, mixed with vampires. right down to the plot-twist were erika eleniak\\'s character, aurora, reveals she\\'s a robot. coolio goes badly over-the-top as the dope-smoking, bloodsucking 187 (pff, code from the hood as a name?!?!). casper van dien\\'s character\\'s named capt. van helsing (hahaha!) and he looks like...,er well, casper van dien. udo kier as capt. varna, former commander of the demeter, is only shown on a monitor-screen and he really does seem to have trouble reading his lines from an auto-cue (poor udo, what where you doing in this flick?). and then we have langley kirkwood as count orlock, one of the most pathetic and laughable dracula\\'s ever to (dis)grace the silver screen. just look at his outfit. instead of some cool-looking futuristic black suit or something, he\\'s wearing a cheap old-school halloween-suit with fringes. you thought richard roxburgh was unconvincing as dracula in van helsing? then wait until you see langley\\'s performance! the set-designers went overboard on this one. the interior of the demeter looks like a cross between an oil-tanker and an old steel-factory, which they decorated with awful lights and colors like green, pink, blue and yellow. the prop-master must have forgotten that this movie takes place in the year 3000, because the characters use guns which look like today\\'s.45 magnums and \"prof\" uses a non-motorized, non-floating wheelchair. it has to be pushed around in order to move. aside from one dried-up corpse, a few impalements and one dismemberment there\\'s absolutely no gore. and the vampire-fangs and contact-lenses look fake as hell. add to that also the most lame, stupid and abrupt ending ever: humvee and aurora are the only survivors. instead of having one final (bloody) showdown with count orlock, they lock themselves in the control-room. then aurora explains that before her program was upgraded and joining narcotics, she used to be a \"protheus 3.2 pb\", in other words: a pleasure-bot. so she says \"well then, what are you waiting for\". humvee answers \"ain\\'t gotta tell me twice. come on, girl\", picks her up and... \"boom!\" the ship explodes and credits roll. no sex-scene, no erika flashin\\' her boobies, no bloody climax,... just one more shot of udo kier reading a line on the monitor and it\\'s over. so, this movie is a must-see for every bad-movie-lover, but i must warn them: it gets really painful at times. and everyone claiming that van helsing, underworld or even queen of the damned is the worst vampire-movie of the new millennium clearly is insane, or just has not seen dracula 3000 yet.',\n"," 'first of all, i think this film quite rightly got the plug it deserved on all of the broadsheets in the uk. this might be partly due to the involvement of ken loach himself but also because it is a rather poignant essay of the one crucial aspect of globalisation the richer countries exploiting the availability of the cheap labour available from the poorer countries. this is not the first of its kind to be done, but this film had sympathy, warmth, objectivity and class and a viable plot. the whole film, however, is carried by kierston wareing, with no real development of other characters such as her business partner or even her dad, who both could have highlighted the different shades of the argument and perhaps externalised some of the conflicts that we all face when we encounter the by-products of such exploitation. by this, i mean the cheap strawberries in the supermarkets, casual builders, the \"baristas\" working behind the various coffee chains and basically all of the other unsung victims who go to subsidising every aspect of our material life. the basic kernel of the film does succeed to some extent in showing the different facets of the human character such as sympathy for the individual versus the indifference to the abstracted group; highlighting the similarities in the trials and tribulations of people in both the \\'host\\' and the \\'donor\\' countries; the fact that a lot of people are up for making a quick buck off the suffering of others; and that people exist who will try and be fair to others regardless of their backgrounds. however, the reality might not be so clear cut and easily digestible. perhaps not all of the immigrant workers are so docile and placid; perhaps not all immigrant workers are so subservient and accepting when the roles are reversed and the female becomes the sexual predator; perhaps not all immigrant workers insist on \"passing on the favour instead of returning it\". while it is a noble effort and some effort has been made to highlight the plight of such immigrants, it is still just a snapshot of a much more knotty problem a problem that we are all, to some extent, responsible for. that said, \"bravo\" to the fantastic mr. loach for agreeing to get his \"hands dirty\" with such a current and contentious subject.',\n"," \"this is one of the more poorly made movies i have ever seen. one has to take anything by truffaut seriously; it's not just some b-movie cranked out by hacks. evidently truffaut could not decide whether he was making a noir or a sentimental chick flick. and neither could deneuve, whose dozen (?) character flip-flops are simply unbelievable -- not even badly acted; just not acted at all. among other things, how a woman as beautiful as deneuve could be a person such as julie/marion is simply beyond anyone's ability to suspend disbelief; the role absolutely demands someone not so beautiful. belmondo's acting also suffers although imho his character is not quite as unbelievable as deneuve's. the cliché ending (which i will not describe) is unfortunately all too appropriate for

that quality in the first lethal weapon. and not everyone could pull it off (certainly not sylvester or arnold). i genuinely believed that john mclane was thinking of these things as he went along. even the ridiculous cliches were pulled off nicely. the wife was not a victim, but a clear head. i think the second die hard was strong also, but when the wife's character disappeared, a lot of the heart was lost. he was no longer a father and husband like in the first one. he no longer seemed like someone who really wanted to live. but in this one, there's a real sense of pain (as in the bloody feet) and urgency (his wife and kids). 7/10. probably not deserving of the top 250 movies of all time, but great nonetheless.\",\n"," 'this is the mj fox film that i like the most. sadly, it was never

watching 12-hour long films. it could become easy for people to assume that this is some kind of regular occurrence - in fact, even in the world of 'arthouse' cinema, such mammoth running times are extremely rare, for obvious reasons. this is one thing that hollywood and art cinema share in common: the generally accepted running time of 90-120 minutes, with a minority of movies that dare to approach, but rarely exceed, the three-hour mark. for this reason, a film like out 1 (runtime: 729 minutes) is a challenge for even the most hardened cinephile, and it goes some way in explaining why it has only ever been screened on a handful of occasions and remains extremely hard to find. originally devised as a tv series by maverick nouvelle vague director jacques rivette, it raised little interest from the french networks, and wound up being given a brief theatrical run instead (peter watkins was forced to do much the same with his brilliant nuclear war pseudo- documentary the war game, although that had more to do with state censorship than issues with running time). shown a couple of times in 1971, out 1 has re-emerged at a handful of rivette retrospectives over the last two decades, and many who have seen it, including esteemed us critic jonathan rosenbaum, have acclaimed it as one of the greatest films of all time. is it? well, yes, if you like rivette. that alone is a big 'if', as jacques rivette has never been a commercially successful director. only two of his films were hits (celine and julie go boating (1974) and la belle noiseuse (1991), both superb), and many remain difficult to find on dvd today (out 1 only recently became available over the internet after a rare videotape was uploaded). nevertheless, he is greatly respected within the film community, and with good reason - his playfully surreal narratives, sense of pacing and use of improvisation set him apart as one of cinema's most unique and satisfying film-makers. out 1 deals with a theme that re-occurs throughout rivette's work: the nature of acting, particularly in the context of theatre and improvisation. his fascination with acting make rivette's films a far more collaborative process than many of his contemporaries, as the improvisational aspects allow actors to have a far more active role in determining how the film comes together. out 1 is roughly divided into four major narratives, gradually intertwining and blurring as the film develops: two consisting of acting troupes, each trying to devise post-modern theatrical adaptations of aeschylus plays; the other two individual petty thieves (played by nouvelle vague icons jean-pierre léaud and juliet berto) pursuing eccentric methods of making money; and an overarching plot involving a mysterious balzac-inspired conspiracy centred around an organisation known as 'the thirteen'. as with any rivette film featuring a 'conspiracy' narrative, the mysteries and secret organisations are little more than a red herring. as the characters are slowly explored and revealed and their plans and interpersonal connections break down, the film becomes increasingly symbolic of post-1968 ennui and the decline of the ideals of that era. for a film made in 1971, these were remarkably prescient themes; another french director in jean eustache would tackle this topic equally satisfyingly in his 1973 masterpiece the mother and the whore. but this is not the limit of out 1's scope. comprised of eight episodes of roughly 90 minutes each (the beginning of each episode has a brief, abstract black-and-white still montage of the events of the previous chapter), out 1 is no less watchable than any quality tv series, and may even be better experienced on a one-episode- at-a-time basis. this is not to say that it does not remain challenging even when viewed in segments. like most rivette films, it uses the first few hours to simply establish the characters before embarking on the plot, of sorts, and some of those early scenes (particularly the sequences depicting the actors' heavily abstracted 'exercises') seem interminably long. these scenes are important, however, not just as an exploration of the improvisational acting methods that play both a literal and a metaphorical role in the film, but as a method of adjusting the viewer to the somewhat languorous pace of the film. paradoxically, long takes make long films far more tolerable for an audience, and this understanding of pacing has led rivette, along with more modern directors like michael haneke and béla tarr, to create films with less commercial running-times that nevertheless retain the capacity to leave viewers enthralled. in a film that is in many ways about acting, the acting is fantastic. many famous nouvelle vague faces appear, including the aforementioned léaud and berto, the outstanding michel lonsdale and rivette regular bulle ogier. even another legendary director in eric rohmer has a great cameo as a balzac professor who appears in a pivotal scene. the people and architecture of paris c. 1971, though, seem to have an equally significant role - the city landscapes, crowd scenes and interested onlookers freeze out 1 in time, a document of a place at a point in history. after a little more than 720 minutes, the film ends on an impossibly brief, enigmatic note; yet, the exhausting journey that the viewer has taken is so full of possibilities, intricacy and spontaneity, that one would be forgiven for wanting to start all over again from the beginning, or see the next twelve hours in the lives of these characters. for those who have watched many kinds of cinema and think they have seen everything the art form has to offer, out 1 is a reminder that cinema has the potential to be so many more things and diverge in so many more directions than current conventions allow. for film-makers, film critics and artists of all disciplines, this is something to be cherished.\",\n"," 'why do they make

need to wash something off... and you will know even if you do, nothing is going to go away. watching home movies put together by a neighbor might be dull and boring, but it is not going to be offensive and disgusting. the movie has an exceedingly negative perspective on live and not one character in it has any noteworthy redeeming value. it does not explain aberrant behavior such as infidelity, drug addiction, violence, teen rebellion, or a father having sex with his teenage daughter, all of them presented front and center in this movie, nor does it offer anything resembling insight into them. it simply tosses them out there for you to watch. as you watch you will keep hoping that somewhere along the way there is going to be some payoff to justify putting up with the garbage paraded across the screen. but there is no payoff. there is merely more depravity, and depravity which is not even presented in an interesting manner. those who consider the family unit to be

watchable. normally, i can base a movies value on the names associated with it and their previous work , in fact that\\'s the main reason i saw this movie. but sadly, it does not live up to anything they have been associated with prior (maybe kicking and screaming). to start, i\\'ll list the things that are good about the movie: the directing has a certain quality to it. considering the director\\'s previous work, i guess that makes sense. it\\'s not too far from a shot for shot remake of walk the line. which i count as a good thing because that\\'s what your going for in a spoof/parody. they did a good job with the bio-pic aspect of it, which just means that they can see the humor in the constant ups and downs of a rock star\\'s life. some, and i mean some, of the lines are good. i did chuckle and the elvis part. now the bad: the first line of the movie is \"i need cox\", i a movie were the main character, not just that but the movie, is named dewey cox, you can really only use that once. but they do it again and again. the movie fools you into thinking it\\'s a jim abrahams/david zucker spoof (creators of cult comedies like airplane!, hot shots! top secret! and naked gun) but becomes a jason friedberg/aaron seltzer spoof (creator of such oscar worthy masterpieces as scary movie, scary movie 2, scary movie 3, scary movie 4, date movie, epic movie and the

are people pretending to be these people and they are doing it badly!that\\'s funny!\". as i mentioned before, elvis was the only good one because i could see elvis doing the \"look out man!\" thing, but even that gets ruined by a line that follows it that is basically \"only two kinds of people know it(referring to karate), the chinese and the king. and i am the king.\" we get it you are elvis presley. a monkey joke, it needs repeating, monkey jokes died in middle school. the pacing of the movie interrupt scenes that could be used for character development and story to give you scenes feigning what could be considered important story points. it completely negates the scene prior. example, dewey cox is in a hotel room living it up after his first taste of weed, he is on the phone with his wife. she begins to tell him that she feels a distance. now normally, a knocked up type comedy would use this moment to bring down the fun for a moment. use it to give us a real insight into the relationship of the characters, thus creating a more interesting level to any involvement later on. an airplane type comedy would use this moment to do constant sight gags, or create a fake sense of pain increasing any sort of visual of audible humor later on. but instead it goes a complete different route when there\\'s a knock the door. he hangs up and there is no development of his relationship with his wife or any really funny sight gags or quick quips. instead we are treated to a story from dewey\\'s dad about how dewey\\'s music inadvertently killed his mom. oh dear, his mom is dead due to his music. how plausible. that\\'s not funny, that\\'s epic movie. i should not have expected more from a movie that has a little kid being chopped in half and still talking, with his legs just standing there. the whole thing leaves me confused as to what this movie wants me to find humorous. i fail to see the humor in this movie, an occasional chuckle and smirk does not make this movie worthy of viewing. it could have been a lot better. less irony and more funny. airplane!, naked gun, top secret!, that\\'s how this movie should have been. an abrahams/zucker-type movie making fun of bio-pics done by apatow and kasdan, that would be magic. but instead we are treated to a movie that suffers from schizophrenia, it\\'s backed the names behind good comedies like orange county and knocked up, it\\'s titled like a will ferrel \"insert title: the story of insert guy\\'s name\" movie with none of the humor, it has the premise of an abrahams/zucker film, but is written like a friedberg/seltzer. the whole comes off as messy and leaving you feeling unfulfilled. save your money and rent apatow\\'s back catalog and hope and pray that the train of suck that left dewey cox will

who was trying to help him. eddie meets joan and together they try to reach the border and escape from justice. \"you only live once\" is the second american movie of fritz lang and a tragic melodrama. the depressive story of love and prejudice discloses a tough criticism to a very unfair, corrupt and hostile society, where losers do not have the chance to recover their dignity and common people are corrupt. the screenplay is visibly influenced by bonnie and clyde, who died on 23 may 1934, ambushed in their getaway car - therefore less than three years before the release date of this film. henry fonda and sylvia sidney show a great chemistry in good performances in this minor movie of this great director. my vote is seven. title (brazil): \"vive-se uma só vez\" (\"you only live once\")',\n"," 'a blockbuster at the time of it\\'s original release (it was the second-highest grossing film of 1976), the third screen version of a star is born has always divided critics and fans alike. the film open to scathingly negative reviews, however, $5.6 million-budgeted picture went on to gross over $150 million at the box office and won an academy award and five golden globes. it\\'s not without some irony that streisand\\'s most commercially successful film would also remain her most controversial. for every ten fans who state that star is streisand\\'s best film, there are always ten more who claim it is the weakest film in her filmography. although both sides have some merit to support their claims, it should still be noted that the seventies take on a star is born remains one of the most touching and highly entertaining showbiz dramas that hollywood ever produced. for my money, it\\'s the best version of the often-told tale. the film is solidly enjoyable and throughly absorbing. changing the setting from the old hollywood studio system to the competitive world of the music industry was actually a great idea, and the screenplay forges a realistic contrast between the characters\\' romance and their careers. this is the main area that the 1976 version of a star is born actually surpasses it\\'s classic predecessors. for example, the film is especially successful when depicting the clashing personal and professional difficulties during recording sessions and the never-ending phone calls that interrupt kristofferson\\'s songwriting attempts. this version of the story is also more believable in it\\'s portrayal of the lead characters. for example, the female leads in the two previous versions were so virtuous and self-sacrificing that they came off as saints. on the other hand, esther, the female lead in this version, is not only portrayed as being strong and passionate, but also flawed and conflicted. this makes her feel more \"real\" than the janet gaynor or judy garland characters felt in the previous films, and makes the story that much more effective. the performances are all on target, even if some of the supporting characters are not fleshed out enough. if you are looking for an actress/singer who can walk the fine line between tough and vulnerable without making herself seem like a script contrivance, streisand is definitely the girl you want. she\\'s one of the few film stars who can make even the most banal dialogue seem fresh and natural, and, as usual, she manages to make a strong emotional connection with the viewer. simply put, her esther is a fully-realized, three-dimensional human being. kris kristofferson may not get much respect now for his laid-back characterization, however, he\\'s always interesting watch and displays a magnetic charisma here that he seldom displayed elsewhere in his career. kristofferson actually received rave reviews at the time from newsweek, time, and even the new yorker\\'s usually vicious pauline kael. gary busey and paul mazursky also give believable performances, but both have a fairly minimal amount of screen time. the film\\'s soundtrack recording was also a massive success, hitting the #1 on billboard\\'s hot 200 and selling over four million copies in the us alone. the streisand-composed \"evergreen\" (with lyrics from paul williams) is unarguably one of the most gorgeous songs in contemporary pop, brought to even-further life by an absolutely incomparable vocal performance from streisand. the rest of the film\\'s original songs (mostly composed by williams and rupert holmes) are pretty good as well, and streisand sounds fantastic - her live solo numbers remain in the memory long after the rest of the movie has faded. streisand\\'s vibrant performances bring \"woman in the moon\" and \"with one more look at you\" to thrilling life, and make even sillier numbers like \"queen bee\" work far better than they have the right to. kristofferson\\'s solo numbers sound somewhat tuneless, however, that may have been intentional since he is playing a singer in decline. though naturally dated in some respects (it definitely does reflect the decade in which it was made), the seventies take on a star is born still holds up remarkably well. the film is well-mounted and slickly produced, the chemistry between the leads is extremely powerful and always feels genuine, and streisand has two emotional scenes near the finale that are both aching effective. in conclusion, a star is born is not only entertaining and moving, but it also transcends all criticism.',\n"," ...]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":17}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fYKrYmBe-n09"},"source":["# Sentencepiece
